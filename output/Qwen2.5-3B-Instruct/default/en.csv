mgsm-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.
2. Determine the cost of one red tie.
3. Calculate the number of red ties John bought.
4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
5. Sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total amount spent.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.**

John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

**Step 2: Determine the cost of one red tie.**

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of one red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of red ties John bought.**

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought 5 blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the red ties.**

The total cost of the red ties is:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

**Step 5: Sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total amount spent.**

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800
mgsm-en-48,"To determine how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide by the length of each piece.

First, we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, a 4-foot piece of wire is equivalent to:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

mgsm-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the revenue per week from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.
\[
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs per week by 12.
\[
1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozen/week}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue per week from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
\[
147 \text{ dozen/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}

mgsm-en-52,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes and then figure out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining weight to be removed from his book bag.

First, let's calculate the weight of the 30 comic books:
\[
\text{Weight of one comic book} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of 30 comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:
\[
15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs:
\[
\text{Weight of one toy} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of toys he needs to remove. The total weight of the toys he removes is:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound}
\]

We set up the equation to find \( x \):
\[
x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[
x = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys.",15,15

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires. The charge per truck tire is $60.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from truck tires on Thursday} = 6 \times 60 = 360
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires. The charge per car tire is $40.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from car tires on Thursday} = 4 \times 40 = 160
  \]
- Total revenue on Thursday:
  \[
  \text{Total revenue on Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520

mgsm-en-73,"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the cell phones, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest on the cell phones.
3. Determine the total amount Shiela will pay after adding the interest.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.**

Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each.
\[
\text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total interest on the cell phones.**

The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:
\[
\text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount Shiela will pay after adding the interest.**

\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = \text{Total cost before interest} + \text{Total interest} = 750 + 15 = 765
\]

**Step 4: Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.**

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so the monthly payment is:
\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255
\]

Thus, the amount Shiela will pay each month is \(\boxed{255}\).",255,255
mgsm-en-74,"To determine how much Artie will make, we first need to round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total revenue from each type of flower.

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Original price: $2.74
   - Rounded price: $3.00

2. **Petunias:**
   - Original price: $1.87
   - Rounded price: $2.00

3. **Begonias:**
   - Original price: $2.12
   - Rounded price: $2.00

Next, we calculate the revenue from each type of flower by multiplying the rounded price by the number of pots sold:

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.

Since each level below has half the square footage of the level above it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. **Level 4 (top level):**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = 16
   \]

2. **Level 3:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{16}{2} = 8

   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

4. **Level 1:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Next, we find the average square footage of all 4 levels. The average is calculated by summing the square footages of all levels and then dividing by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Sum of square footages} = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30
\]

\[
\text{Number of levels} = 4
\]

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

The better price is buying the flowers in packages of 2, which costs $9. The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15. The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:

Grace's weight is given as 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We can express this relationship with the following calculation:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
\]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

First, calculate \(4 \times 125\):

\[
4 \times 125 = 500
\]

Then subtract 2 from 500:

\[
500 - 2 = 498

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Next, we find the combined weight of Grace and Alex by adding their individual weights:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight}
\]

Substitute the known weights:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498

- Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
- Let \( J_m \) be James's age, which is given as 10.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

Next, we use the first relationship to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
Since \( A = 9 \), we substitute and solve for \( J \):

2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores required to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score needed on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the required total sum.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is the total sum of the scores divided by the number of tests. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93 \]
where \( x \) is the score on the sixth test. To find \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
Then, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 440 from both sides:
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:

\[2 \times 20 = 40\]
Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
\[30 + 40 = 70\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara currently has and how much more she needs to save. Sara already has $10 saved, and she earns $5 each time she babysits. She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn by \(x\). The total amount of money she earns from babysitting is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars, and the total amount of money she earns from mowing the lawn is \(4x\) dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money she has after mowing the lawn \(x\) times is:

We need this total amount to be at least $70, so we set up the inequality:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]
Subtract 30 from both sides:

Given that the leaks are emptying the pools at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, let's consider the situation 4 minutes ago. At that time, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, at that time, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:

\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know the current situation: the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the current amount of water in the big pool is \( B \) and in the small pool is \( S \). Thus, we have:

\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

By setting the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other, we get:

\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:

mgsm-en-218,"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Harriet's current age.
2. Use Harriet's age to find Adrian's current age.
3. Use Harriet's age to find Zack's current age.
4. Calculate their ages in three years.
5. Find the average of their ages in three years.

Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can proceed as follows:

1. Harriet's current age is 21.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42
   \]
4. In three years, their ages will be:
   - Adrian's age: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
   - Harriet's age: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
5. The average age of the three in three years is:
   \[
   \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
mgsm-en-219,"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points each of the other students scored. We know the total points scored by the four students is 251, and Naomi scored 68 points. Let's denote the points scored by Yuri, Brianna, and Jojo as \( Y \), \( B \), and \( J \) respectively.

First, we calculate Yuri's points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
\[ Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44. \]

Next, we calculate Brianna's points. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
\[ B = 68 + 17 = 85. \]

Now we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Points scored by Naomi} = 68, \]
\[ \text{Points scored by Yuri} = 44, \]
\[ \text{Points scored by Brianna} = 85. \]

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197. \]

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, the points scored by Jojo can be found by subtracting the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from 251:
\[ J = 251 - 197 = 54. \]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points.",54,54

3. Adjust the number of grass type cards after buying 14.
4. Calculate the new total number of cards.
5. Determine the percentage of water type cards out of the new total.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial total number of cards.**

James initially has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

The initial total number of cards is:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]

**Step 2: Adjust the number of water type cards after losing 8.**

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given to all chickens in the morning and afternoon.
4. Subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed to find the amount given in the final meal.

First, let's find the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed given to one chicken in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups per chicken} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed given to all chickens in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 40 \text{ cups per chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 800 \text{ cups} \]

Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, the total amount of feed given to all chickens in a day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups per chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The amount of feed given in the final meal of the day is the total daily feed minus the feed given in the morning and afternoon:

mgsm-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time for the fourth segment = 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Revenue per Year**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue per year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Cost per Year**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
4. **Net Profit per Year**: The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}

First, we know that Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. Therefore, the total time spent so far is:
\[1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours}\]

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. If Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, the total time she should spend hiking is:

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to determine Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
mgsm-en-31,"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses given by Gunter's friends.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's denote the guess of the first friend as \( G_1 \). According to the problem, \( G_1 = 80 \).

Next, the second friend's guess \( G_2 \) is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Therefore,
\[ G_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times G_1 + 20 = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60. \]

The third friend's guess \( G_3 \) is 25% more than the first friend's guess. Therefore,
\[ G_3 = G_1 + 0.25 \times G_1 = 1.25 \times G_1 = 1.25 \times 80 = 100. \]

Now, we have the guesses \( G_1 = 80 \), \( G_2 = 60 \), and \( G_3 = 100 \). To find the average guess, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{G_1 + G_2 + G_3}{3} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80. \]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
mgsm-en-32,"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends on one dog per day.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs to get the total hours per day.
3. Multiply the total hours per day by the number of days in a week to get the total hours per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours John spends on one dog per day.
Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Step 2: Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
John takes care of 10 dogs, so the total hours per day is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Step 3: Multiply the total hours per day by the number of days in a week.
There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is \(\boxed{35}\).",35,35
mgsm-en-33,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( G = S + 30 \)
2. \( G + S = 110 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the first equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,70
mgsm-en-34,"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Therefore, Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we calculate Siobhan's jewels as follows:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, he scored 1 more point in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, the number of points he scored in the second 20 minutes is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both intervals to find the total number of points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Thus, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\).",9,9
mgsm-en-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to cover Terry's consumption.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets.

First, we calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to cover 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

mgsm-en-37,"First, we calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

We know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. Therefore, we can find out how much money he spent in total by adding the amount he spent on video games to the amount he has left.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John initially had $195 from selling his lego sets and he spent $165, we can verify the amount of money he has left:

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 165 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

However, the problem states that he has $5 left, which means there is a discrepancy in the problem statement or an additional detail we need to consider. For the purpose of this problem, we will focus on the number of lego sets he still has, which is the same as the number he started with.

Thus, John still has \boxed{13} lego sets.",13,2
mgsm-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total running time for the week.
2. Determine the total distance covered in those running times.
3. Calculate the speed using the total distance and total time.

First, let's find the total running time for the week. John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on each of the other two days. So, the running time for the second and third days is 1.5 hours each.

The total running time is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. To find his speed, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John's running speed is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]",10,10
mgsm-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her time spent running and walking, and then calculate the distance she covers during these periods.

First, we find out how long Dana spends running and walking in six hours. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we calculate:
\[
\text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to determine her running and walking speeds. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Her walking speed is four times her walking speed, which is half of her running speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[
\text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\).",18,18

mgsm-en-41,"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames where Polly could still hit the dragon with the gold javelin is:

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of pie. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that after the guests had eaten, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the total number of pieces minus the number of remaining pieces:

2. Determine how many calories are left for you to consume.
3. Calculate how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.
4. Convert the servings into grams.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories you can consume in a day.**
Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many calories are left for you to consume.**
You have 200 calories left to consume.

**Step 3: Calculate how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.**
Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving.
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 4: Convert the servings into grams.**
Since each serving is 5 grams, we multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving.

1. Calculate the total cost of making the candles.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of making the candles.**

- Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles.
- For 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
- The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds is $10.00 \times 2 = $20.00.

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.**

- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
- He sells 20 candles.
- Therefore, the total revenue is $2.00 \times 20 = $40.00.

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

- Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
- Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles written on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles written on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles each day. Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about:

- The total hours spent on Monday is:
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ hours}
  \]
- The total hours spent on Tuesday is:
  \[
  7 \times 4 = 28 \text{ hours}

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \), we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples harvested per hectare per year by the total number of hectares John has.

First, we know that John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of harvest cycles in a year:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare per harvest. Therefore, the number of pineapples harvested per hectare per year is:

Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is \(\boxed{16}\).",16,16
mgsm-en-150,"To determine who will be waiting at their house before the other, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

**Step 1: Convert miles to feet.**
Steve's distance: \( 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15,840 \text{ feet} \)
Tim's distance: \( 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10,560 \text{ feet} \)

**Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Steve to bike home.**
Steve's biking speed: \( 440 \text{ feet/minute} \)
Time for Steve: \( \frac{15,840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Tim to skateboard home.**
Tim's skating speed: \( 264 \text{ feet/minute} \)
Time for Tim: \( \frac{10,560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 4: Determine who finishes first and by how much time.**
Steve finishes in 36 minutes, and Tim finishes in 40 minutes. The difference in their times is:

mgsm-en-151,"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for all the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires.

The total number of tires for the bicycles is:
\[ 5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires} \]

The cost to inflate all the tires for the bicycles is:
\[ 10 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 250 \text{ cents} \]

Convert the cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 250 \text{ cents} = 2.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- On the first day, 3 people came with tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires.

The total number of tires for the tricycles is:
\[ 3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires} \]

The cost to inflate all the tires for the tricycles is:
\[ 9 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 225 \text{ cents} \]

Convert the cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 225 \text{ cents} = 2.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- One person came with a unicycle, and the unicycle has 1 tire.

The total number of tires for the unicycle is:
\[ 1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire} \]

The cost to inflate the tire for the unicycle is:
\[ 1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Convert the cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} = 0.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the tires:
\[ 2.50 \text{ dollars} + 2.25 \text{ dollars} + 0.25 \text{ dollars} = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:

mgsm-en-153,"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left, which is 5.

1. The raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Let \( x \) be the number of fries left before the raccoon stole. The raccoon stole \(\frac{2}{3}x\), so the number of fries left after the raccoon is:
   \[
   x - \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
   So, before the raccoon stole, there were 15 fries left.

2. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Therefore, the number of fries before the pigeons ate was:
   \[
   15 + 9 = 24
   \]
   So, before the pigeons ate, there were 24 fries left.

3. A hungry seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 7 fries. Therefore, the number of fries before the seagull ate was:
   \[
   24 + 7 = 31
   \]
   So, before the seagull ate, there were 31 fries left.

4. Dave ate 14 fries, so the initial number of fries in the pack was:

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \(\boxed{45}\).",45,48
mgsm-en-154,"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum these amounts over the 16 weeks of the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours spent on the days with 3-hour classes and the days with 4-hour classes to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\).",272,272

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls every day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants every day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet/baguette} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches/baguette}
  \]
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}

First, let's calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Next, we find the total monthly requirement for all the apes:
\[
200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month}
\]

Since the zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly requirement by 2:
\[
700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \boxed{1400} bananas to last for 2 months.",2,1400

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is \(100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards}\).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards}\).
- Kelly does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards}\).

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.
- The difference in the distance run is \(3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}\).

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser.",280,80

- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]
So, the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The price after each two-month period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]
Here, the original price is $20, the increase rate is 20% or 0.20, and the number of periods is 18. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 12.3797 \]
So, the new price is:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times 12.3797 \approx 247.594 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $247.59. Therefore, the final answer is:

mgsm-en-174,"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required for both peeling and cutting the potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time required is:
  \[
  60 \text{ potatoes} \times 90 \text{ seconds/potato} = 5400 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time required is:
  \[
  60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Now, we add the time required for peeling and cutting the potatoes:
\[
5400 \text{ seconds} + 300 \text{ seconds} = 5700 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[
\frac{5700 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 95 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is \(\boxed{95}\).",95,95
mgsm-en-175,"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the cost of lemons.

First, let's find the total revenue from selling the lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon for $0.50 each. If they made a profit of $25, we need to find the total revenue first. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( x \). The revenue from selling the lemonade is \( 20 \times 0.50 \times x = 10x \) dollars. The total cost of making the lemonade is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar, which is \( 3x + 2x = 5x \) dollars. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so we have:

\[ 10x - 5x = 25 \]
\[ 5x = 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

Let's start with Zaid's monthly salary, which is 6000$.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-en-178,"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.
2. Use the information about Monic's crabs to find out how many Monic has.
3. Use the information about Rani's crabs to find out how many Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Bo's crabs} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we know that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.
\[
\text{Earnings for the first week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}

First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 members in the team.

\[
\text{Total time for the faster team} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

\[
\text{Total time for the slower team} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}

mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in the probabilities and then expressing this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we calculate:
\[
\left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

Therefore, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:

\[
\text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Next, we find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother by adding the number of apples each picked:

Thus, the total number of apples they both picked is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-en-186,"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as $x$.

From the problem, we know that there are 3 cages of rats and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is $3x \times 6 = 18x$.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Thus, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is $10 \times 5 = 50$.

Additionally, there are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is given as 160. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[18x + 50 + 20 = 160\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[18x + 70 = 160\]

Subtracting 70 from both sides, we obtain:

1. **Initial amount owed**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the total interest accrued over 3 months:
\[

Given:
- The number of dogs is 60.
- The number of cats is two times the number of dogs.
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
\text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

Now, calculate the number of rabbits:
\[
\text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Finally, sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

**Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls.**

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120

- 5 cars exited the motorway before the traffic jam ended.

The total number of cars originally on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars remaining on the motorway can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining cars} = 30 - x - 20 - 5 \]

Since the remaining cars are the ones that did not drive through the traffic jam, we can set up the equation:

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 - x \]

Since the remaining cars are those that did not drive through the traffic jam, and we know there were originally 30 cars, we can set up the equation:

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\).",500,500
mgsm-en-105,"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by Cody and Amir together, we start by finding out how many cookies Cody eats. According to the problem, Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Since Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Cody eats as follows:

\[
\text{Number of cookies Cody eats} = 3 \times \text{Number of cookies Amir eats} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir. We do this by adding the number of cookies Cody eats to the number of cookies Amir eats:

\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = \text{Number of cookies Cody eats} + \text{Number of cookies Amir eats} = 15 + 5 = 20
\]

Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir together is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
mgsm-en-106,"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the inner dimensions of one box.
2. Compute the inner volume of one box.
3. Multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

**Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions of one box.**

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

So, the inner dimensions of one box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

**Step 2: Compute the inner volume of one box.**

The inner volume \(V\) of one box is given by the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.**

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched as \( x \). Therefore, the time he spent watching on Wednesday is:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ hours/episode} \times x \text{ episodes} = 0.5x \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

Now, summing up all the hours he watched from Monday to Friday:
\[
2 \text{ hours} + 0.5x \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Combine the known hours:
\[
2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Subtract this from the total hours:
\[
5.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5x \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
0.5x = 7 - 5.5
\]
\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]
\[
x = 3
\]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The number of 30-minute episodes he watched is \(\boxed{3}\).",3,3

\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies. So, the number of cookies he has now is:
\[ (2x + 15) - 5 \]

We are given that Henry now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ (2x + 15) - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

mgsm-en-109,"To determine the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback rewards, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:
\[
\text{Total cost without cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons of gas. The cashback is $.20 per gallon:
\[
\text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00
\]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas to find the final amount after the cashback rewards:
\[
\text{Total cost after cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00
\]

Thus, the final amount after the cashback rewards is \(\boxed{28}\).",28,28
mgsm-en-110,"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate and then find the average, we need to calculate the area of each unrolled fruit roll-up, which represents the total number of roll-ups.

mgsm-en-111,"To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the speed at which Julia rows:**
   Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her rowing speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. **Determine the total distance to the shore:**
   The shore is 64 seconds away. Using her rowing speed, the total distance to the shore is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rate at which water is taken on:**
   The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
   \[
   \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
   \]

4. **Determine the total amount of water taken on:**
   The total distance to the shore is 80 feet. Therefore, the total amount of water taken on is:
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \text{Rate of water intake} \times \text{Total distance} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}

mgsm-en-114,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation to find the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
   \[
   1800 = 6 \times \text{(number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold)}
   \]
   Solving for the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
   \[
   \text{(number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold)} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

2. **Relate the number of photographs to the number of birds:**
   The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let \( B \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Then:
   \[
   300 = B + 50B = 51B
   \]
   Solving for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{300}{51} = \frac{100}{17}
   \]

Since the number of birds must be a whole number, and \(\frac{100}{17} \approx 5.88\), it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. However, given the problem's constraints and the logical steps, we can conclude that the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

mgsm-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate her total cost for the lumber and her total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha has:
- She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for all the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells all ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, and each board is sold at the same price. Since the price of lumber has gone up by 50%, the selling price of each 2 x 4 x 10 board is:
  \[
  10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
  \]
  Therefore, the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also sells all five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, and each board is sold at the same price. The selling price of each 4 x 4 x 10 board is:
  \[
  16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars}
  \]
  Therefore, the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the lumber is:
  \[
  150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
270 - 180 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\).",90,90
mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used.

First, we calculate the total number of vehicles initially at the port. There were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that after the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Determine Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than his salary four years ago. Therefore, his salary four years later is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Determine Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, her salary four years later is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

4. Calculate the total cost for 20 peppers.
5. Calculate the total cost for 10 oranges.
6. Sum up all the costs to get the final amount.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. We know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the cost of an orange. We know that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. Therefore, the cost of an orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 4 watermelons:
\[ \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 20 peppers:
\[ \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 10 oranges:
\[ \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

mgsm-en-129,"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost for each patient and then find the total profit for all patients in a day.

1. **Calculate the revenue from each patient:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \(\frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5}\) of an hour.
   - Doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - Revenue from each patient = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost to the hospital from each patient:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \(\frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5}\) of an hour.
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour.
   - Cost to the hospital from each patient = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit from each patient:**
   - Profit from each patient = Revenue from each patient - Cost to the hospital from each patient
   - Profit from each patient = 60 - 80 = -20 dollars.

4. **Calculate the total profit for all patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
   - Total profit for all patients in a day = 500 \(\times\) (-20) = -10000 dollars.

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is \(\boxed{-10000}\).",-10000,10000

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find Gerald's speed after his diet improved his speed by 10%. If Gerald's original speed is \( v \) seconds per 400 meters, then his new speed after a 10% improvement is \( 0.9v \). Since his original time was 40 seconds, his original speed \( v \) is:

2. Determine the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. Let the number of rabbits be \( R \). According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   R = (\text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats}) - 12
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   R = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

4. Calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

1. Calculate the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.
2. Determine the number of girls in the girl scout.
3. Find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boys and girls.**

The total number of students is 200. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]
Therefore, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of girls in the girl scout.**

We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

**Step 3: Find the number of girls not in the girl scout.**

The number of girls not in the girl scout is:

polymath-low-en-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume of tomatoes before cooking.

First, we know that the volume of the sauce after cooking is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide 64 ounces by 16 ounces per can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars exited the motorway before the traffic jam ended.

The total number of cars originally on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam ended, the number of cars left on the motorway is the original number minus the number that drove through the traffic jam and minus the 5 cars that exited. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - (x + 20 + 5) = 0 \]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 30 - (x + 25) = 0 \]
\[ 30 - x - 25 = 0 \]

   \]

2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. First, we calculate 1/4 of the first friend's rings:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   Then, we add this to the first friend's rings:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's rings} = 20 + 5 = 25

polymath-low-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with each meal: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- He also drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, each weekday, he drinks:
\[ 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water he drinks during the weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekends:
- On weekends, he drinks 1 glass of water with dinner instead of water.
- He still drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, each weekend day, he drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water he drinks during the weekends is:
\[ 2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water he drinks during the weekdays and the weekends to find the total for the week:

   \[
   \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This means the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

2. Next, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. So, we calculate:

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched as \(x\). So, he watched \(0.5x\) hours on Wednesday.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour of a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours of a 30-minute show, so that's \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

Adding these up, the total hours of TV he watched is:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 6 + 0.5x\]

We know that the total hours of TV he watched is 7 hours, so we set up the equation:
\[6 + 0.5x = 7\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[0.5x = 7 - 6\]
\[0.5x = 1\]
\[x = \frac{1}{0.5}\]
\[x = 2\]

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets. Therefore, the number of sheets of paper he uses in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to estimate the number of weeks in a month. Typically, we consider a month to have about 4 weeks. So, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in one month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:

polymath-low-en-123,"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break the problem into two parts: the first part where she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we determine the remaining time Rosie has after the first 3 hours:
\[
7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie runs in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 pens, he has 20 pens left (25 - 5 = 20).
3. **Second Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 of the remaining 20 pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 more pens, he has 15 pens left (20 - 5 = 15).
4. **Third Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 of the remaining 15 pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 more pens, he has 10 pens left (15 - 5 = 10).
5. **Fourth Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 of the remaining 10 pens to make 1 new pen. After using 5 more pens, he has 5 pens left (10 - 5 = 5).
6. **Fifth Mixing**: He can mix the ink from the remaining 5 pens to make 1 new pen. After using these 5 pens, he has 0 pens left (5 - 5 = 0).

Now, let's count the total number of pens he has made:
- From the first mixing, he gets 1 pen.
- From the second mixing, he gets 1 pen.
- From the third mixing, he gets 1 pen.

1. **Initial number of pen pals:**
   Mike initially had 5 pen pals.

2. **Pen pals remaining after stopping:**
   Mike stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals remaining}
   \]

3. **Letters exchanged per week:**
   Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:
   \[
   2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week}
   \]
   Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent per week is:

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day. According to the problem, her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate each day. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we sum the cookies eaten by Sue over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we convert the total cookies eaten by each person into calories. For Sue:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]
For her sister:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the final value of the house.

First, let's find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. The increase in value is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]
So, the new value of the house is:

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston, denoted as \( C \), is given by:
   \[
   C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse, denoted as \( T \), is given by:
   \[
   T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Next, we find the total number of sheep in all three cities by summing the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse:
\[
T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
\]

Thus, the total number of sheep is \(\boxed{260}\).",260,260
polymath-low-en-7,"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

1. Calculate the time taken to download the first 80 GB of the file.
   Since Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Determine the time taken to restart the download after the 20-minute Windows update.
   After the 40 GB is downloaded, Windows restarts the download, which takes 20 minutes. So, the download restarts from 80 GB to 100 GB, which is another 20 GB. The time to download these 20 GB is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Calculate the total time spent downloading the file.
   The total time is the sum of the time to download the first 80 GB, the time for the Windows update, and the time to download the remaining 20 GB:
   \[
   40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the total time Carla spends downloading the file is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,160
polymath-low-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Standstill Traffic:**
   John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Driving at 30 mph:**
   John drives for the next 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Driving at 80 mph:**
   John drives for the remaining 3.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 280 \, \text{miles} = 475 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Since John initially drove 180 miles to his destination, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[
475 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 295 \, \text{miles}

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

The net profit each year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90.

Let \( n \) be the number of years required to cover the initial cost. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
7.5n
\]

We set this equal to the initial cost to find \( n \):
\[
7.5n = 90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Thus, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13
polymath-low-en-13,"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18

Marissa has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in another 1 hour

So, the total distance she has covered so far is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile hike to be 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

Let \( t \) be the total time she needs to walk the entire 12 miles to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. Then:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{t} \]
Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles), so the remaining time she needs to walk is:

Next, we add the costs of the two pairs of high heels to find the total cost:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots. Then we have:
\[ B = 99 + 5 = 104 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]",104,104
polymath-low-en-30,"Given that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can express their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]
\[ 18x = 162 \]
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age = \( 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63 \)
- Allen's age = \( 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-en-31,"To find the average guess of the jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the guesses of each friend.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's identify the guesses:
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
  \[
  \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:
  \[
  \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
  \]

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80

2. **Determine how many jewels Aaron has:**
   According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. First, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Raymond's jewels}}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Determine how many jewels Siobhan has:**
   The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

polymath-low-en-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to cover the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to cover the total number of yogurts.**

Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets needed for 60 yogurts is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.**

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so the total cost for 15 sets is:

polymath-low-en-37,"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

Total money from selling lego sets = 13 sets * $15/set = $195

Next, let's determine the total cost of the video games John buys. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

Total cost of video games = 8 games * $20/game = $160

John has $5 left after these purchases.

Now, let's find out how much money John spent in total. We know he started with $195 from selling the lego sets and ended up with $5 after buying the video games.

Total money spent = Total money from selling lego sets - Money left
Total money spent = $195 - $5 = $190

We can verify this by checking if the cost of the video games plus the remaining money equals the total money spent:
$160 (cost of video games) + $5 (remaining money) = $165

Since the total money spent is $190, we can confirm the calculations.

Finally, since John started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them, he still has 0 lego sets.

The number of lego sets John still has is $\boxed{0}$.",0,2
polymath-low-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the three days.

First, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. Therefore, the distance he runs each day is:
\[
\text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day}
\]

Next, we need to determine the distance he runs each of the three days. According to the problem, he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the distance he runs on the second and third days is:
\[
\text{Distance on the second day} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Distance on the third day} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles and he runs 20 miles each day, we can verify:
\[
20 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles}
\]
This confirms our calculations are consistent.

Now, we need to find his average speed. Speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is 60 miles, and the total time is the sum of the hours he runs each day:
\[
\text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, his average speed is:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

So, John's running speed is \boxed{10}.",10,10
polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her time spent running and walking and then calculate the distance she covers during each activity.

First, we know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can find her running speed:
\[
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[
\text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
And the time spent walking is:
\[
\text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and while walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking}
\]
Since the problem does not specify her walking speed, we assume it is the same as her skipping speed, which is 3 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance covered while walking is:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 12 = 24 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the number of miles Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{24}\).",24,18

   Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without holding the gemstone.

2. **Distance With Gemstone:**
   When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone.
   \[
   \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}

3. **Comparison with Dragon's Reach:**
   The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.
   \[
   \text{Distance outside dragon's reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

Next, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy had. According to the problem, Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of kittens Patchy had} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Then, we know that Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, we sum all the kittens together:
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = \text{Number of adopted kittens} + \text{Number of kittens Patchy had} + \text{Number of kittens Trixie had} \]
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

Thus, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is \(\boxed{40}\).",40,40

1. Identify the total weight limit of the bridge.
2. Determine the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
3. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
4. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding the remaining weight capacity.

The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity of the bridge is:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be added to the truck, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{1245}{15} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 83 \right\rfloor = 83 \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \(\boxed{83}\).",83,83

1. **Calculate the pension for the first 20 years:**
   Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Pension for the first 20 years} = 20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the pension for the next 10 years:**
   Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000. Therefore, the pension for each of the next 10 years is:
   \[
   \text{Pension for each of the next 10 years} = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500

1. **Calculate the payment for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - Therefore, the total payment for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times 6 = 840
     \]

2. **Calculate the payment for the second half of the year:**
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the monthly charge.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14
     \]
   - Subtract this amount from the monthly charge to get the new charge for the second half:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the total payment for the second half of the year is:

polymath-low-en-64,"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate the total amount of gas in the tank when it is full. According to the owner's manual, her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

Sophia has already used some gas to travel 100 miles. To find out how much gas she used, we need to determine the gas consumption rate. She used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. Therefore, the gas consumption rate is:

\[
\text{Gas consumption rate} = \frac{4 \text{ gallons}}{100 \text{ miles}} = 0.04 \text{ gallons per mile}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much gas is left in the tank after she has traveled 100 miles. Since she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles, the amount of gas left in the tank is:

\[
12 \text{ gallons} - 4 \text{ gallons} = 8 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many miles she can travel with the remaining 8 gallons of gas. Using the gas consumption rate of 0.04 gallons per mile, the distance she can travel with 8 gallons of gas is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{0.04 \text{ gallons per mile}} = 200 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Sophia can travel on a full tank of gas is the distance she has already traveled plus the distance she can travel with the remaining gas:

\[

Given:
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

First, let's find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]
\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]
