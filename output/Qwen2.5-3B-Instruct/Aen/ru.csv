mgsm-ru-47,"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of a red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, and blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of a red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of a red tie} = \text{Cost of a blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost of a blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount John spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of a red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, to find the total amount John spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is $800. The final answer is:

mgsm-ru-48,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from a 4-foot piece of wire.

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length in inches as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches. We do this by dividing the total length by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of wire that Tracy got is:

mgsm-ru-49,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the building.
2. Determine the number of apartments that are occupied.
3. Subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of vacant apartments.

First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]
So, the total number of apartments in the building is 120.

Next, we need to find out how many apartments are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]
So, 90 apartments are occupied.

Now, we can find the number of vacant apartments by subtracting the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]
Therefore, the number of vacant apartments is 30.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]",30,30
mgsm-ru-50,"To determine how much Lloyd earns from selling eggs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from selling eggs.
2. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find out how many eggs are sold daily. Since each egg costs 2 dollars and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the price of a dozen eggs is 2 dollars. Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs sold daily is:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Next, we calculate the daily earnings by multiplying the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen:
\[ 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out the weekly earnings, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earns \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs in a week.",294,294
mgsm-ru-51,"To determine how long it will take Tom's ship to return, we first need to calculate the distance it traveled away from its starting point.

The ship traveled from 13:00 to 16:00, which is a duration of 3 hours. At a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance traveled is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to return this 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time \( t \) required to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour is given by:
\[ t = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time taken for the round trip is the time to travel away plus the time to return:

The total time taken is 8 hours, which is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,5
mgsm-ru-52,"Let's denote the number of toys Yuri needs to take out as \( x \).

First, we know that each comic weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. Yuri needs to take out a total of 15 pounds of items. If he takes out 30 comics, the total weight of the comics is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The remaining weight that needs to be taken out by toys is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys \( x \) that need to be taken out is:

\[ x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Yuri needs to take out 15 toys. The final answer is:

mgsm-ru-54,"Let's denote the number of kittens taken from the animal shelter as \( x \). According to the problem, the first cat, Patches, gave birth to three times the number of kittens taken from the shelter, so Patches gave birth to \( 3x \) kittens. The second cat, Trixie, gave birth to 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens is the sum of the kittens from the shelter and the kittens from both cats. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 3x + 12 = 4x + 12 \]

We know that the number of kittens taken from the shelter is 7. Therefore, we can substitute \( x \) with 7:

2. Add the delivery fee to the total order amount.
3. Subtract the delivery fee from the total order amount to get the base total.
4. Add the delivery fee back to the base total.
5. Add the tip to the total.

Let's start with the initial total order amount:
- Initial total order amount: $40.00

Next, calculate the delivery fee:

Let's denote the area of the 4th level as \( A_4 \), the area of the 3rd level as \( A_3 \), the area of the 2nd level as \( A_2 \), and the area of the 1st level as \( A_1 \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]

Since each level has half the area of the level below it:
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average area of these four levels. The average area \( \text{Average} \) is calculated by summing the areas of all levels and dividing by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} \]

Substituting the values we found:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 60 \]

Thus, the average area of the levels is:

1. **First 180 days:**
   - Cecilia needs 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Number of days: 180
   - Total cups needed: \( 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \)

2. **Remaining 185 days:**
   - Cecilia needs 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Number of days: 185
   - Total cups needed: \( 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Sara washes 4 times as much laundry as David, so \( S = 4D \).
2. Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sara, so \( R = \frac{1}{2}S \).

Given that Sara washes 400 pounds of laundry, we can substitute \( S \) with 400:
\[ S = 400 \]
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David wash:
\[ R - D = 200 - D \]

Since \( S = 4D \) and \( S = 400 \), we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 4D = 400 \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

Now we can find the difference:
\[ R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

First, we know that Li can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds. Since Li was running 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time to run 400 meters with obstacles was:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. If we let Gerald's original speed be \( v \) meters per second, then his new speed is:
\[ v_{\text{new}} = v \times 1.10 \]

Since Gerald's original time to run 400 meters was 40 seconds, his original speed \( v \) can be calculated as:

mgsm-ru-199,"Let's denote the number of sentences edited for each publisher per week as \( x \) and \( y \) respectively. According to the problem, \( x + y = 1000 \).

The payment for each publisher is as follows:
- Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence.
- Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, which is $0.10 per sentence.

The total earnings per week can be expressed as:
\[ 0.05x + 0.10y \]

Given \( x + y = 1000 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 1000 - x \]

Substituting \( y \) into the total earnings equation:
\[ 0.05x + 0.10(1000 - x) \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ 0.05x + 100 - 0.10x \]
\[ = 100 - 0.05x \]

To find the total earnings, we need to determine the value of \( x \). Since \( x \) and \( y \) are equal in terms of the number of sentences edited, and they sum to 1000, we can assume \( x = y = 500 \).

Substitute \( x = 500 \) into the earnings equation:
\[ 0.05(500) + 0.10(500) \]
\[ = 25 + 50 \]
\[ = 75 \]

Therefore, the total earnings per week are:

First, let's calculate the amount of water Baldur collects in the morning:
- Baldur collects 5 vats of water each morning.
- Each vat contains 5 liters of water.
Therefore, the total amount of water collected in the morning is:
\[ 5 \text{ vats} \times 5 \text{ liters/vat} = 25 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water Baldur collects in the evening:
- Baldur collects 6 vats of water each evening.
- Each vat contains 5 liters of water.
Therefore, the total amount of water collected in the evening is:
\[ 6 \text{ vats} \times 5 \text{ liters/vat} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we sum the amounts collected in the morning and in the evening to find the total amount of water collected each day:

First, we calculate John's total earnings without the bonus. John earns $2000 per week and works for 52 weeks in a year:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we calculate the bonus. The bonus consists of a one-time payment of $5000 and a 5% increase in his weekly salary. The increase in his weekly salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the bonus is:

\[ 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

For the rest of the year (51 weeks), he earns $2100 per week. Therefore, his earnings for the remaining weeks are:

\[ 2100 \times 51 = 107100 \]

Adding the bonus payment to his earnings from the remaining weeks, his total earnings for the year are:

\[ 107100 + 5000 = 112100 \]

Adding the initial earnings of the first week, his total earnings for the year are:

\[ 104000 + 5000 = 109000 \]

However, since the bonus is received on the first day of the year, it is included in the first week's earnings. Therefore, the correct total earnings for the year are:

The scores for the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. Let's calculate their sum:

\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The average of the six test scores is given by the sum of the six scores divided by 6. We want this average to be 93:

\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93 \]

To find \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 440 from both sides:

\[ x = 558 - 440 \]
\[ x = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The required score is \(\boxed{118}\).",118,98

- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the distance traveled each week is at least \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the distance is at least \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during the next three weeks:

- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the distance traveled each week is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the distance is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

Finally, we add the distances from both periods to find the total distance traveled:

   \text{Weight of each caramel apple} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:**
   There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40 grams:

First, we know that twenty cups cost 1200 dollars less than the cost of half a dozen (12) plates. Each plate costs 6000 dollars. Therefore, the cost of 12 plates is:
\[ 12 \times 6000 = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the cost of 20 cups is 1200 dollars less than the cost of 12 plates. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 20x = 72000 - 1200 \]
\[ 20x = 70800 \]

To find the cost of one cup, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 20:

\[ x = 3540 \]

Thus, the cost of each cup is \(\boxed{3540}\).",3540,145

- Therefore, the total cost is 30 $ + 40 $ = 70 $.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara can earn from babysitting:
- She earns 5 $ each time she babysits.
- She babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * 5 $ = 20 $.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara can earn from mowing the lawn:
- She earns 4 $ each time she mows the lawn.
- Let's denote the number of times she needs to mow the lawn as \( x \).
- Therefore, she earns \( 4x \) from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has 10 $ saved. So, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn and babysitting is:

Simplify the inequality:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 or more times. The final answer is:

- On the third day, the number of customers is \( y \).

The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 50 + y = 500 \]

Subtract 50 from both sides:
\[ 2x + y = 450 \]

We need to find the number of customers on the third day, \( y \). To do this, we need to determine the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the number of customers on the first day directly, but we can infer it from the information given.

Given that the total number of customers over the three days is 500, and knowing the first two days' counts, we can solve for \( y \) directly by isolating it in the equation:
\[ y = 450 - 2x \]

Since the number of customers on the first day \( x \) is part of the initial count of 100 customers, and the second day's count is 150 (100 + 50), we can use these values to find \( y \).

From the equation \( 2x + y = 450 \), we know:
\[ 2x = 450 - y \]

Since \( x \) is part of the initial count of 100, and the second day's count is 150, we can deduce:
\[ y = 500 - (100 + 150) = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers on the third day is:

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire cards
- 20 grass cards
- 40 water cards

After losing 8 water cards and buying 14 grass cards, the new counts are:
- Fire cards: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass cards: 20 + 14 = 34 (increased by 14)
- Water cards: 40 - 8 = 32 (decreased by 8)

The total number of cards in the collection now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water cards now is 32. The probability \( P \) of randomly selecting a water card is the number of water cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ P = \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

1. **Calculate the effective download speed during the update:**
   - Normally, Karla downloads at 2 GB per minute.
   - During the 40% of the time that Windows is updating, her speed is reduced by 40%. 
   - 40% of 2 GB per minute is \(0.4 \times 2 = 0.8\) GB per minute.
   - Therefore, her effective download speed during the update is \(2 - 0.8 = 1.2\) GB per minute.

2. **Determine the time taken to download the file during the update:**
   - The total file size is 200 GB.
   - At an effective speed of 1.2 GB per minute, the time to download 200 GB is \(200 \div 1.2 = \frac{200}{1.2} = \frac{2000}{12} = \frac{500}{3} \approx 166.67\) minutes.

We can set up the equation based on the information above:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the fraction:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

   Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile route. Therefore, the total time she has is:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and 1 hour on the next 2 miles. Therefore, the total time spent so far is:

mgsm-ru-20,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of the orange juice:
- The orange juice is on two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange juice is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of the pineapple juice:
- The pineapple juice is on three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple juice is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we mix the orange juice and the pineapple juice:
- The total volume of the mixed drink is \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters.
- The total amount of water in the mixed drink is \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \) liters.

When we spill one liter of orange juice, we lose one liter of water. So, the amount of water lost is \( \frac{1}{3} \) liter (since the orange juice is \( \frac{2}{3} \) water).

The remaining amount of water is:
\[ \frac{47}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{46}{3} \approx 15.33 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink:
- The total volume of the mixed drink after spilling one liter is 24 liters.
- The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixed drink is \( \frac{46}{3} \) liters.

To find the fraction of the total volume that is water, we calculate:
\[ \frac{\frac{46}{3}}{24} = \frac{46}{3 \times 24} = \frac{46}{72} = \frac{23}{36} \]

Thus, the fraction of the remaining 24 liters that is water is \( \frac{23}{36} \). To find the number of liters of water in the 24 liters, we multiply:
\[ 24 \times \frac{23}{36} = \frac{552}{36} = \frac{46}{3} \approx 15.33 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the milk:
\[ \text{Cost of milk} = 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
\[ \text{Cost of apples} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the chicken dish, milk, and apples:
\[ \text{Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples} = 12.50 + 45 + 6 = 63.50 \]

Mari's total expenditure was $50, so the amount spent on pizza boxes is:
\[ \text{Amount spent on pizza boxes} = 50 - 63.50 = -13.50 \]

Since the amount spent on pizza boxes cannot be negative, we need to recheck the problem constraints. However, the problem states that the total expenditure is $50, and the cost of the other items is $63.50, which means there must be an error in the problem setup or an additional item not mentioned. Given the problem constraints, let's assume the total expenditure is $63.50 (as the problem setup seems to have an inconsistency).

Now, let's find out how many boxes of pizza Mari ordered:
\[ \text{Cost per box of pizza} = 8.50 \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes of pizza} = \frac{63.50 - 63.50}{8.50} = \frac{0}{8.50} = 0 \]

Since the amount spent on other items exceeds the total expenditure, let's assume the problem meant to say the total expenditure is $63.50 and we need to find how many boxes of pizza were ordered with the remaining money.

\[ \text{Number of boxes of pizza} = \frac{63.50 - 63.50}{8.50} = 0 \]

mgsm-ru-38,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running. We can then use the formula speed = distance / time to find his speed.

First, let's find the distance John runs each day. He runs 60 miles in total over 3 days. So, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to determine the time he spends running each day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the second and third days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is:
\[ \text{Time on second and third days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running over the 3 days:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we can find John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, the speed at which John runs is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]",10,10
mgsm-ru-39,"Let's denote the running speed as \( R \) and the walking speed as \( W \).

Given:
- \( R = 4W \)
- \( W = 3 \) miles per hour
- \( R = 2W \) (since she runs half as fast as she can run)
- Therefore, \( R = 2 \times 3 = 6 \) miles per hour

Now, we need to determine how far she can run and walk in 6 hours, given that she runs for one-third of the time and walks for two-thirds of the time.

Total time: 6 hours

Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours
Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours

Distance covered while running: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \)
Distance covered while walking: \( 3 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \)

Total distance covered: \( 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \)

mgsm-ru-41,"To determine how far Polli could stand from the dragon and still hit it with her javelin when holding the sapphire, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the range with the sapphire:**
   - Without the sapphire, Polli's javelin range is 400 feet.
   - With the sapphire, Polli's javelin range increases by a factor of 3.

   \[
   \text{Range with sapphire} = 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300-gram package of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you still have left to consume.
3. Calculate how many calories each gram of chips provides.
4. Determine how many grams of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.

First, we know that each 300-gram package contains 5 portions, and each portion contains 250 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories in the 300-gram package is:
\[ 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you still have left to consume. Your daily goal is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories are in each gram of chips. Since 300 grams of chips contain 1250 calories, the number of calories per gram is:
\[ \frac{1250}{300} = \frac{25}{6} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories per gram} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram:
\[ \frac{200}{\frac{25}{6}} = 200 \times \frac{6}{25} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the materials used to make 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue**

Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times 2.00 \text{ dollars/candle} = 40.00 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost**

To make 10 candles, Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and 10 fuses. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and 10 fuses is $10.00. Since he is making 20 candles, he needs twice the amount of materials:
\[ 2 \times 10.00 \text{ dollars} = 20.00 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 40.00 \text{ dollars} - 20.00 \text{ dollars} = 20.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the pure profit Charlie will make is:

mgsm-ru-112,"To determine how many times the marker board is cleaned per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of times the marker board is used per day by all teachers combined:**
   - Each teacher uses the marker board 2 times per day.
   - There are 4 teachers.
   - Therefore, the total number of times the marker board is used per day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ uses per teacher} = 8 \text{ uses per day}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of times the marker board is cleaned per use:**
   - Each use of the marker board is cleaned 3 times.
   - Therefore, the total number of times the marker board is cleaned per day is:
     \[
     8 \text{ uses per day} \times 3 \text{ cleans per use} = 24 \text{ cleans per day}

mgsm-ru-113,"To determine how many flowers Ryan will have after 15 days, given that 5 of them did not grow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers planted in 15 days.
2. Subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted.

First, we calculate the total number of flowers planted in 15 days. Since Ryan plants 2 flowers per day, we multiply 2 by 15:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted. Ryan planted 30 flowers, but 5 of them did not grow, so we subtract 5 from 30:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers Ryan will have after 15 days is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]",25,25
mgsm-ru-114,"Let's denote the number of photos in Brittaney's phone as \( B \), the number of photos in Jamal's phone as \( J \), and the number of photos on the photo of the ducks as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( J = 6B \)
2. \( B = 50D \)
3. \( J = 1800 \)

First, we substitute \( J = 1800 \) into the first equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \), we get:
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use \( B = 300 \) in the second equation to find \( D \):
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \), we get:
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks on the photo Jamal took in the zoo is \( D = 6 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,6
mgsm-ru-115,"To determine the profit Sasha will make from selling all her remaining wood, we need to calculate the total cost of the wood she has and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood:
Each piece costs $10, so for 10 pieces, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood:
Each piece costs $16, so for 5 pieces, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of all the wood is the sum of the costs of the two types of wood:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the wood. Since the prices have increased by 50%, the selling price of each piece of 2 x 4 x 10 wood is:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
So, for 10 pieces, the total revenue is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price of each piece of 4 x 4 x 10 wood is:
\[ 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]
So, for 5 pieces, the total revenue is:
\[ 5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the wood is:
\[ 150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 270 - 180 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Sasha will make is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]",90,90
mgsm-ru-116,"To solve the problem, we first need to understand the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 parts. Let's denote the number of parts of sugar as 7x and the number of parts of water as 13x. Therefore, we have:
\[7x + 13x = 120\]
\[20x = 120\]
\[x = \frac{120}{20}\]
\[x = 6\]

Since the number of parts of sugar is 7x, we substitute \(x = 6\) into the expression for sugar:
\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of sugar cubes used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

mgsm-ru-118,"Let's denote the number of containers imported on the first day as \( x \). According to the problem, each container contains 5 transport vehicles. Therefore, the total number of transport vehicles on the first day is \( 5x \).

On the second day, additional containers were imported, and the total number of transport vehicles in the port became 30. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as \( y \). Each of these containers also contains 5 transport vehicles, so the total number of transport vehicles on the second day is \( 5y \).

The total number of transport vehicles in the port after the second day is the sum of the transport vehicles from both days, which is given as 30. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5x + 5y = 30 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ x + y = 6 \]

From this equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 6 - x \]

Since \( x \) is the number of containers imported on the first day, and we need to find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can substitute the possible values for \( x \) (which must be a non-negative integer and less than or equal to 6) to find \( y \).

If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 6 - 1 = 5 \).
If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 6 - 2 = 4 \).
If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = 6 - 3 = 3 \).
If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 6 - 4 = 2 \).
If \( x = 5 \), then \( y = 6 - 5 = 1 \).
If \( x = 6 \), then \( y = 6 - 6 = 0 \).

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( x \), we can choose any of these values for \( y \). The most straightforward and common solution is to consider the smallest non-negative integer for \( x \), which is 1. Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ y = 5 \]

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,4
mgsm-ru-119,"Let's denote the initial salaries of Adrienne and Lily as \(A\) and \(L\) respectively.

Given:
- Adrienne's initial salary \(A = 40,000\) dollars.
- Adrienne's salary increased by 40% after 4 years.
- Adrienne's salary increased by 30% compared to Lily's initial salary.

First, calculate Adrienne's salary after 4 years:
\[ A_{\text{after 4 years}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A = 1.4 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \]

Let \(L\) be Lily's initial salary. According to the problem, Adrienne's salary after 4 years is 30% higher than Lily's initial salary:
\[ 56,000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{56,000}{1.3} = 43,076.92 \approx 43,077 \]

Now, calculate Lily's salary after 4 years, which increased by 40%:
\[ L_{\text{after 4 years}} = L + 0.4L = 1.4L = 1.4 \times 43,077 = 60,308.28 \approx 60,308 \]

Finally, calculate the combined salary of Adrienne and Lily after 4 years:
\[ A_{\text{after 4 years}} + L_{\text{after 4 years}} = 56,000 + 60,308 = 116,308 \]

Therefore, the combined salary of Adrienne and Lily after 4 years is:

1. Calculate the number of sheets used per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month.
3. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 blocks of paper per week, and each block contains 30 sheets. Therefore, the number of sheets used per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ blocks/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/block} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to estimate the number of weeks in a month. Typically, a month is considered to have about 4 weeks. So, the number of sheets used per month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses each month is \(\boxed{240}\).",240,240
mgsm-ru-121,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of fruits brought by Moresette and Kayla.

First, let's identify the number of fruits Moresette brought:
- Moresette brought 5 apples.
- Moresette brought 8 oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of fruits Kayla brought:
- Kayla brought twice as many apples as Moresette. Since Moresette brought 5 apples, Kayla brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kayla brought half as many oranges as Moresette. Since Moresette brought 8 oranges, Kayla brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, we sum up the total number of fruits brought by both Moresette and Kayla:
- Total apples: \(5 + 10 = 15\)
- Total oranges: \(8 + 4 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fruits:
\[15 + 12 = 27\]

Thus, the total number of fruits they brought together is \(\boxed{27}\).",27,27

   - On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, which is \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
   - So, in the first three days, she slept \(8 + 6 + 4 = 18\) hours.

2. **Determine the number of hours Saida slept on Friday:**
   - According to the problem, she slept 1 hour more than the total hours she slept in the first three days.
   - The total hours she slept in the first three days is 18 hours.
   - Therefore, on Friday, she slept \(18 + 1 = 19\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours Saida slept during the entire week:**
   - Monday: 8 hours
   - Tuesday: 6 hours
   - Wednesday: 4 hours

First, calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
\[
\text{Distance in the first 3 hours} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}

   Each patient pays $200 per hour, and the hospital operates 24 hours a day. Therefore, the revenue per patient per day is:
   \[
   200 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 4800 \text{ dollars/day}

3. **Calculate the total cost for the doctors:**
   The doctors take 150 patients per hour and the hospital operates 24 hours a day. Therefore, the total number of patients seen by the doctors in a day is:
   \[
   150 \text{ patients/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 3600 \text{ patients/day}

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total number of bees is 700.
2. The number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae.
3. The number of larvae is twice the number of matoks.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ W + L + M = 700 \]
\[ W = 2L \]
\[ L = 2M \]

First, we can substitute the expression for L from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ W = 2(2M) = 4M \]

Now we have expressions for W and L in terms of M:
\[ W = 4M \]
\[ L = 2M \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ 4M + 2M + M = 700 \]
\[ 7M = 700 \]
\[ M = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of matoks (M), we can find the number of worker bees (W):

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The total revenue is given as $92.

Next, we calculate the total costs. The costs include the cost of the cleaning supplies for the 3 existing clients and the potential 5 new clients.

For each client, the cost of cleaning supplies is:
- 2 bottles of cleaning solution at $2 each = 2 * $2 = $4
- 1 pack of cleaning sponges at $5 = $5

So, the total cost per client is $4 + $5 = $9.

For the 3 existing clients:
- Total cost = 3 clients * $9 per client = 3 * $9 = $27

For the 5 potential clients, since he is confident about them, we include them in the calculation:
- Total cost for 5 potential clients = 5 clients * $9 per client = 5 * $9 = $45

The total cost for all clients is:
- Total cost = $27 (for existing clients) + $45 (for potential clients) = $72

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total costs = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the weekly profit is $20.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the moshel of balloons is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the price becomes 120% of its previous value.

3. **Number of Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, over 36 months, there will be:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price After Each Increase**: Let \( P_n \) represent the price after \( n \) increases. The price after each increase can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   P_{n+1} = P_n \times 1.20
   \]
   where \( P_0 = 20 \).

5. **General Formula for Price After \( n \) Increases**:
   \[
   P_n = 20 \times (1.20)^n
   \]

6. **Price After 18 Increases**:

If Jacki works freelancing without hiring a tax professional, she loses $35 per hour in potential earnings. Therefore, her potential earnings from freelancing would be \( h \times (35 - 35) = 0 \) dollars, which is not feasible. Instead, let's assume she can work \( h \) hours at $35 per hour without a tax professional.

If Jacki hires a tax professional, she will work \( h - 3 \) hours (since she loses 3 hours to the tax professional) at $90 per hour.

Her potential earnings from freelancing without a tax professional would be \( 35h \) dollars.

Her potential earnings from freelancing with a tax professional would be \( 90(h - 3) \) dollars.

The additional money she would get by hiring a tax professional is the difference between her potential earnings with and without the tax professional:

- Sally Two (S2) = S4 / 3 = 32 / 3 = 10.67 years (approximately)

However, the problem states that the ages are whole numbers, so let's recheck the relationships with whole numbers.

Given:
- Salley Four (S4) = 32 years
- Salley Three (S3) = 32 years
- Granny Red (G) = 2 * S3 = 2 * 32 = 64 years
- Sally Two (S2) = S4 / 3 = 32 / 3 = 10.67 (not a whole number, so let's assume a different interpretation)

Since the problem states that S2 is 2/3 of S4, let's assume S2 = 2/3 * 32 = 21.33 (not a whole number, so let's assume a different interpretation).

Given the problem constraints, let's assume S2 = 16 years (a whole number that fits the relationships).

Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the winning candidate received is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the losing candidate received is:

Given:
1. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations: \( 4w \).
2. The number of pink gerberas is five times the number of white carnations: \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \):
\[ 5w = 200 \]
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ w = 40 \]

Now, we find the number of red roses:
\[ 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

mgsm-ru-182,"Let's denote the current ages of Jin, Mark, and Yan as \( J \), \( M \), and \( Y \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jin is two years older than Mark, so \( J = M + 2 \).
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years more than half of Yan's age at that time. If Yan is 30 years old, then two years ago Yan was 28 years old. Therefore, two years ago Mark's age was \( M - 2 \) and Yan's age was \( Y - 2 = 28 \). According to the problem, \( M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5 \).

Let's solve for \( M \):
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now we know Mark's current age is 21. Using the first piece of information, we can find Jin's age:
\[ J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23 \]

So, Jin is 23 years old. The final answer is:

mgsm-ru-183,"To determine the difference in time between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 400-meter relay race and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the total time for the well-prepared team:
- Each member of the well-prepared team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Since there are four members, the total time for the well-prepared team is:
  \[
  4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the poorly-prepared team:
- The first member runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second member runs 400 meters in \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds.
- The third member runs 400 meters in \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds.
- The fourth member runs 400 meters in \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds.
- The total time for the poorly-prepared team is:
  \[

mgsm-ru-184,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability that the number rolled is greater than 3. A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's determine the probability that two consecutive rolls result in two even numbers. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to compare the two probabilities. The probability that the number rolled is greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability that two consecutive rolls result in two even numbers is 0.25. The ratio of these probabilities is:
\[
\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

This means that the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% higher than the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:

- There are 10 cages with individual mice, each receiving 5 bales of hay.
- There are 20 bales of hay for the rabbits.

The total number of bales of hay used for the mice is:
\[ 3x \times 6 = 18x \]

The total number of bales of hay used for the individual mice is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The total number of bales of hay used for the rabbits is:
\[ 20 \]

The total number of bales of hay used in the entire setup is:
\[ 18x + 50 + 20 = 18x + 70 \]

We know that the total number of bales of hay used is 160. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 18x + 70 = 160 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 18x = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18x = 90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a day.**

Lloyd's hens lay 252 eggs per day.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of eggs produced in a week.**

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs produced in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.**

Eggs are sold at $2 per dozen. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ dollars}}{12 \text{ eggs}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ dollars/egg} \]

Thus, the total revenue from selling 1764 eggs is:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ dollars/egg} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earns $294 on eggs in a week. The final answer is:

1. Calculate the distance traveled from 13:00 to 16:00:
   - Time duration: 16:00 - 13:00 = 3 hours
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Distance: 3 hours * 10 miles/hour = 30 miles

2. Calculate the time required to return the 30 miles at 6 miles per hour:
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles
   - Time: 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, the total time Tom's ship takes to return is 3 hours (outgoing) + 5 hours (returning) = 8 hours.

polymath-low-ru-52,"Let's denote the number of toys Yuri needs to remove as \( t \).

First, we know that each comic weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. If Yuri removes 30 comics, the total weight of the comics removed is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Let's denote the total weight of the comics and toys as \( W \). According to the problem, the total weight of the comics and toys is 15 pounds, so:
\[ W = 15 \]

After removing 30 comics, the remaining weight \( W' \) is:
\[ W' = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys \( t \) that weigh 7.5 pounds is:
\[ t \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \]
\[ t = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of toys Yuri needs to remove is 15. The final answer is:

2. Determine the monthly payment considering the interest.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the five mobile phones:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment considering the interest. The interest is 2% per year, which means the monthly interest rate is:
\[ \text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{2\%}{12} = \frac{0.02}{12} = \frac{1}{600} \approx 0.001667 \]

Since the payment is made in 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over this period. The formula for the future value (FV) of a sum with compound interest is:
\[ FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( PV \) is the present value (total cost), \( r \) is the monthly interest rate, and \( n \) is the number of months.

Here, \( PV = 750 \), \( r = \frac{1}{600} \), and \( n = 3 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ FV = 750 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{600}\right)^3 = 750 \times \left(1.001667\right)^3 \]

Calculating the value inside the parentheses first:
\[ 1.001667^3 \approx 1.005001 \]

Now, we multiply this by the total cost:
\[ FV \approx 750 \times 1.005001 = 753.75075 \]

Since the payment is made monthly, we divide this future value by 3:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{753.75075}{3} \approx 251.25025 \]

   - Total amount of dog food needed in the first 180 days = 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

2. **Determine the number of pails needed:**
   - Each pail contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of pails needed = Total cups needed / Cups per pail = 180 cups / 110 cups/pail.

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{180}{110} = 1.6363636363636363 \approx 1.64 \text{ pails}
   \]

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a pail, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 pails.

Thus, the number of pails Cecilia will need for the first 180 days is $\boxed{2}$.",2,5

According to the problem:
- Sara stirs 4 times the amount of laundry that David does, so \( S = 4D \).
- Raymond stirs half the amount of laundry that Sara does, so \( R = \frac{1}{2}S \).

We are given that Sara stirs 400 pounds of laundry, so:
\[ S = 400 \]

Now we can find the amount of laundry that Sara stirs:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, we find the amount of laundry that David stirs:
\[ D = \frac{S}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

Now we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry that Raymond and David stir:
\[ R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

First, let's find out how many cookies Sью's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate the caloric intake for each day:
- Each cookie contains 200 calories.

So, the caloric intake for her sister on Monday is:
\[ 5 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 1000 \text{ calories} \]

And the caloric intake for her sister on Tuesday is:
\[ 13 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 2600 \text{ calories} \]

The total caloric intake for her sister over the two days is:

Let's break down the cost for 16 cups:
- The first cup costs $5.
- The second cup costs $3.
- The third cup costs $5.
- The fourth cup costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for all 16 cups. We can see that the cups are divided into two groups: the first, third, fifth, etc., cups (odd-numbered) and the second, fourth, sixth, etc., cups (even-numbered).

For the odd-numbered cups:

polymath-low-ru-9,"To determine how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her regular earnings for the first 40 hours and her overtime earnings for the additional 5 hours.

1. **Regular earnings for the first 40 hours:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - For 40 hours, her earnings are calculated as:
     \[
     40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Overtime earnings for the additional 5 hours:**
   - Eliza's overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - Her overtime hourly rate is:
     \[
     1.2 \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
     \]
   - For 5 hours of overtime, her earnings are:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total earnings for the week:**

polymath-low-ru-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find when this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual income from selling the lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual income from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual expenses for maintaining the tree:
- The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the expenses from the income:
- Net profit per year = Annual income from lemons - Annual expenses
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost. We do this by dividing the initial cost by the net profit per year:
- Number of years = \( \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \).

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree.

3. After these sales, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She then sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house, which means she sold \(\frac{1}{2} \left( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
5. After these sales, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{3x - x - 6}{3} \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x - 6}{3} \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{2x}{6} + \frac{6}{6} = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} = 6 \]

First, we calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks per year as a teacher.
- Her hourly rate for teaching is $20.

\[
\text{Annual earnings from teaching} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour}
\]

\[

Next, we calculate her earnings from choreography instructor:
- She works 15 hours per week as a choreography instructor.
- She works 50 weeks per year as a choreography instructor.
- Her hourly rate for choreography instructor is $30.

\[
\text{Annual earnings from choreography instructor} = 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour}

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking.
2. Determine the remaining distance.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance to achieve the desired average speed.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles.
- She spent another 1 hour on the next 2 miles.
So, she has already spent 2 hours hiking.

The total distance of the hike is 12 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles, we use the formula for average speed:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]
We need the total time to be the sum of the time already spent and the time to cover the remaining distance at the required speed. Let \( v \) be the required speed for the remaining 6 miles. Then:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]
\[ 4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right) = 12 \]
\[ 8 + \frac{24}{v} = 12 \]
\[ \frac{24}{v} = 4 \]
\[ v = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, Marissa needs to hike the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The required speed is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,6

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange juice:**
   - Orange juice is 2/3 water.
   - Water in 10 liters of orange juice = \( 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple juice:**
   - Pineapple juice is 3/5 water.
   - Water in 15 liters of pineapple juice = \( 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \) liters.

3. **Total water before spill:**
   - Total water = Water from orange juice + Water from pineapple juice
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters.

4. **Account for the spill:**
   - One liter of orange juice was spilled.
   - Water lost from spill = \( \frac{1}{3} \) liters (since 1 liter is 1/3 of 3 liters).

5. **Total water after spill:**
   - Total water after spill = \( \frac{47}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{46}{3} \) liters.

6. **Total volume of the mixed drink after spill:**
   - Total volume = 10 liters (orange juice) + 15 liters (pineapple juice) - 1 liter (spilled orange juice) = 24 liters.

7. **Calculate the amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:**
   - Let \( W \) be the total water in the 24 liters.
   - Since the total volume is 24 liters and the total water is \( \frac{46}{3} \) liters, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{46}{3} = 24 \times \text{water concentration}
     \]
   - Solving for water concentration:
     \[
     \text{water concentration} = \frac{\frac{46}{3}}{24} = \frac{46}{72} = \frac{23}{36}
     \]
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 24 liters is:
     \[
     24 \times \frac{23}{36} = \frac{552}{36} = \frac{46}{3} \text{ liters}

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x = \text{price of the boots} - 5 \]

We are also given that the price of the first pair of high-heeled shoes is 33 dollars, so \( x = 33 \). Substituting \( x = 33 \) into the equation, we get:

1. Determine how much water each of the two girls took.
   Each girl took \(\frac{1}{6}\) of 24 liters of water.
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]
   So, each girl took 4 liters of water.

2. Calculate the total amount of water taken by the two girls.
   Since there are two girls, the total amount of water taken by the girls is:
   \[
   4 + 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. Determine how much water is left after the girls took their share.
   Initially, there were 24 liters of water. After the girls took their share, the amount of water left is:
   \[
   24 - 8 = 16 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. Calculate the amount of water left after the boy took 6 liters.
   The boy took 6 liters of water, so the amount of water left is:

Initially, there were 30 cars on the road. After the first 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining on the road would be \( 30 - x - 5 \), because \( x \) cars passed through the traffic jam and 5 cars did not need to.

After the next 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining on the road would be \( 30 - x - 5 - 20 \), because \( x \) cars passed through in the first 15 minutes, 5 cars did not need to pass through, and 20 cars passed through in the next 15 minutes.

Since the problem states that the cars that did not need to pass through the traffic jam are the ones that were not on the road after the second 15 minutes, we have:

polymath-low-ru-104,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of puzzle pieces**: 1000 pieces.

2. **Pieces Poppy assembles**: 
   - Poppy assembles a quarter of the total pieces.
   - A quarter of 1000 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{1000}{4} = 250
     \]
   - So, Poppy assembles 250 pieces.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy assembles**:
   - After Poppy assembles 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
     \[
     1000 - 250 = 750
     \]

4. **Pieces Poppy's mom assembles**:
   - Poppy's mom assembles a third of the remaining pieces.
   - A third of 750 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{750}{3} = 250
     \]
   - So, Poppy's mom assembles 250 pieces.

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom assembles**:
   - After Poppy's mom assembles 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
     \[
     750 - 250 = 500
     \]

So, the number of puzzle pieces that are still to be assembled is 500.

The final answer is $\boxed{500}$.",500,500

polymath-low-ru-106,"To find the total internal volume of the three boxes, we first need to calculate the internal dimensions of a single box and then find its internal volume. After that, we'll multiply by three to get the total internal volume.

1. **Calculate the internal dimensions of a single box:**
   - Original dimensions of a box: 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches.
   - Thickness of the walls: 1 inch.

   - Internal length = Original length - 2 * Thickness = 5 - 2 * 1 = 3 inches.
   - Internal width = Original width - 2 * Thickness = 6 - 2 * 1 = 4 inches.
   - Internal height = Original height - 2 * Thickness = 4 - 2 * 1 = 2 inches.

2. **Calculate the internal volume of a single box:**
   - Internal volume = Internal length * Internal width * Internal height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

3. **Calculate the total internal volume of three boxes:**
   - Total internal volume = Internal volume of one box * Number of boxes = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each, totaling 2 hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
- Friday: 2 hours.

So, the total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Given that Фрэнки смотрит телевизор всего 7 hours, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute show is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute shows he watched on Wednesday is 1.5 / 0.5 = 3.

polymath-low-ru-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry planned to bake this year as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he planned, which means he baked \( 2x \) cookies. He then realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he planned, so the number of cookies he actually baked is \( x + 15 \).

Henry then drops 5 cookies, leaving him with \( x + 15 - 5 = x + 10 \) cookies. We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry planned to bake 100 cookies this year. Since he actually baked twice as many as he planned, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{200}\).",200,50

polymath-low-ru-110,"To determine the average number of fruit rolls each person would have eaten if they had eaten all the rolls, we need to calculate the total number of rolls each person has and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of rolls for Beatrix:
- Beatrix has a roll that is 2 times the width and 24 times the length of a standard roll.
- This means Beatrix has \(2 \times 24 = 48\) standard rolls.

Next, let's calculate the total number of rolls for Marsel:
- Marsel has a roll that is 3 times the width and 14 times the length of a standard roll.
- This means Marsel has \(3 \times 14 = 42\) standard rolls.

Now, we sum the total number of rolls:
- Total rolls = Rolls by Beatrix + Rolls by Marsel = 48 + 42 = 90.

To find the average number of rolls each person would have eaten if they had eaten all the rolls, we divide the total number of rolls by 2:
- Average rolls = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the average number of rolls they would have eaten is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
polymath-low-ru-111,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water that accumulated in the boat as Julia rowed back to the shore.

First, let's establish the rate at which water accumulates in the boat. According to the problem, for every 10 feet rowed back, 2 liters of water accumulate. Therefore, the rate of water accumulation is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]

Next, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed back to the shore. The problem states that Julia rowed for 64 seconds. We also know that in the first 16 seconds, she rowed 20 feet. To find the total distance rowed, we need to determine the rate at which she rowed the remaining distance.

Given that she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Rowing speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Since she rowed for a total of 64 seconds, the total distance rowed is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water that accumulated in the boat. Using the rate of 0.2 liters per foot, the total amount of water is:

\[ \text{Total water} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that accumulated in the boat when Julia reached the shore is:

According to the problem, Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittaney's phone, and we know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos. Thus, we can write:

\[ J = 1800 \]
\[ J = 6B \]

Substituting \( J = 1800 \) into the equation \( J = 6B \):

\[ 1800 = 6B \]
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittaney's phone can store 300 photos.

Next, let's denote the number of photos of ducks on one photo as \( P \). According to the problem, the number of photos in Jamal's phone is 50 times the number of ducks on one photo of ducks. Thus, we can write:

\[ J = 50P \]

Substituting \( J = 1800 \) into the equation \( J = 50P \):

\[ 1800 = 50P \]
\[ P = \frac{1800}{50} = 36 \]

So, there are 36 ducks on one photo of ducks.

3. Sum the total costs to find the total cost of all materials.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the materials.
5. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 dосks:**
   - Sasha has 10 dосks.
   - Each 2 x 4 x 10 dосk costs $10.
   - Total cost = 10 dосks * $10/dосk = $100.

2. **Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 dосks:**
   - Sasha has 5 dосks.
   - Each 4 x 4 x 10 dосk costs $16.
   - Total cost = 5 dосks * $16/dосk = $80.

3. **Total cost of all materials:**
   - Total cost = $100 (2 x 4 x 10 dосks) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 dосks) = $180.

4. **Revenue from selling all materials:**
   - Sasha will sell all 10 2 x 4 x 10 dосks and all 5 4 x 4 x 10 dосks.
   - Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 dосks = 10 dосks * $10/dосk = $100.
   - Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 dосks = 5 dосks * $16/dосk = $80.
   - Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

polymath-low-ru-116,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar used by Кейти, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Кейти used a total of 120 parts (teaspoons) of sugar and water combined. Since the ratio tells us that the 20 parts correspond to 120 parts in total, we can find the value of one part by dividing 120 by 20:

polymath-low-ru-118,"Let's denote the number of containers imported on the first day as \( x \). According to the problem, each container contains 5 imported vehicles, so the number of vehicles on the first day is \( 5x \).

On the second day, let's denote the number of containers imported as \( y \). Each of these containers also contains 5 vehicles, so the number of vehicles on the second day is \( 5y \).

The total number of vehicles in the port after both days is given as 30. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5x + 5y = 30 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ x + y = 6 \]

We need to find the value of \( y \), the number of containers imported on the second day. To do this, we need to determine the value of \( x \), the number of containers imported on the first day. Since \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative integers, we can test possible values for \( x \):

If \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 6 \).
If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 5 \).
If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 4 \).
If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = 3 \).
If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 2 \).
If \( x = 5 \), then \( y = 1 \).
If \( x = 6 \), then \( y = 0 \).

In each case, \( y \) is a non-negative integer. However, the problem asks for the number of containers imported on the second day, and without additional constraints, any of these values for \( y \) would be valid. Since the problem does not specify a unique solution for \( x \), we can choose any valid \( y \). The simplest and most straightforward solution is to choose the smallest possible value for \( y \), which is 1.

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

polymath-low-ru-119,"Let's denote the initial salaries of Adrienne and Lily as \( A \) and \( L \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. Adrienne's initial salary \( A = 40,000 \).
2. Adrienne's salary increased by 40% from four years ago, so his current salary is \( 1.4 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \).
3. Adrienne's salary increased by 30% from four years ago, so \( 1.4A = 56,000 \), which confirms his current salary.
4. Adrienne's salary increased by 40% from four years ago, so his salary four years ago was \( \frac{56,000}{1.4} = 40,000 \).

Since the salaries of Adrienne and Lily increased by the same percentage over the four years, we can denote the increase percentage as \( x \). Thus, Lily's salary four years ago was \( L \) and her current salary is \( L \times (1 + x) = 40,000 \).

We need to find Lily's salary four years ago \( L \). Since Adrienne's salary four years ago was 40,000 and it increased by 30%, we can infer that Lily's salary increased by the same percentage \( x \).

Let's denote the initial salary of Lily as \( L \). Since Adrienne's salary increased by 30%, Lily's salary also increased by 30%. Therefore, if Adrienne's current salary is 56,000, then four years ago Lily's salary was \( \frac{56,000}{1.3} \).

Now, let's calculate Lily's salary four years ago:
\[ L = \frac{56,000}{1.3} = 43,076.92 \]

Since both salaries increased by the same percentage, Lily's current salary is:
\[ L \times 1.3 = 43,076.92 \times 1.3 = 56,000 \]

So, four years ago, Adrienne and Lily's combined salary was:
\[ 40,000 + 43,076.92 = 83,076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the combined salary is:
\[ 83,077 \]

3. Jenne stamps one-third of the letters that don't have stamps.

Let's denote the number of letters that Jenne stamps as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x \) is one-third of the letters that don't have stamps. This means that the number of letters that Jenne stamps is \( x = \frac{1}{3} \times (60 - 30) \).

First, calculate the number of letters that don't have stamps:
\[ 60 - 30 = 30 \]

Then, calculate the number of letters Jenne stamps:
\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10 \]

So, Jenne stamps 10 letters. This means that the 30 letters that already have stamps were the ones that Jenne didn't stamp. Therefore, the number of letters in the pack with pre-stamped envelopes when Jenne started her work was the same as the number of letters that Jenne didn't stamp, which is 30.
