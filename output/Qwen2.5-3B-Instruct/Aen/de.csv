mgsm-de-47,"To determine how much John spent on the Krawatten, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue Krawatten John bought.
2. Calculate the cost of one red Krawatten.
3. Calculate the number of red Krawatten John bought.
4. Calculate the total cost of the red Krawatten.
5. Calculate the total cost of the blue Krawatten.
6. Sum the costs to find the total amount spent.

Let's start with the number of blue Krawatten John bought. Since each blue Krawatten costs 40 US-Dollars and John spent 200 US-Dollars on blue Krawatten, we have:
\[ \text{Number of blue Krawatten} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John bought twice as many red Krawatten as blue Krawatten, the number of red Krawatten is:
\[ \text{Number of red Krawatten} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one red Krawatten. Since red Krawatten cost 50% more than blue Krawatten, and blue Krawatten cost 40 US-Dollars each, the cost of one red Krawatten is:
\[ \text{Cost of one red Krawatten} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ US-Dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red Krawatten:
\[ \text{Total cost of red Krawatten} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ US-Dollars} \]

The total cost of the blue Krawatten is already given as 200 US-Dollars. Therefore, the total amount John spent on Krawatten is:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800 \text{ US-Dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spent on Krawatten is:
\[ \boxed{800} \]",800,800

1. Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches.
2. Divide the total length in inches by the length of each piece in inches.

First, we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, a 4-foot piece of wire is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing 48 by 6:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy had \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire.",8,8
mgsm-de-49,"To determine the number of unbewohnte Wohnungen (unoccupied apartments) in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Wohnungen (apartments) in the building.
2. Determine the number of Wohnungen that are bewohnt (occupied).
3. Subtract the number of bewohnte Wohnungen from the total number of Wohnungen to find the number of unbewohnte Wohnungen.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of Wohnungen.**

The building has 15 Etagen (floors) and each Etage has 8 Wohnungen. Therefore, the total number of Wohnungen is:
\[ 15 \text{ Etagen} \times 8 \text{ Wohnungen/Etagen} = 120 \text{ Wohnungen} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of Wohnungen that are bewohnt.**

We know that 3/4 of the building is bewohnt. Therefore, the number of bewohnte Wohnungen is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ Wohnungen} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unbewohnte Wohnungen.**

The number of unbewohnte Wohnungen is the total number of Wohnungen minus the number of bewohnte Wohnungen:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ Wohnungen} \]

Therefore, the number of unbewohnte Wohnungen is $\boxed{30}$.",30,30
mgsm-de-50,"To determine how much Lloyd earns in a week from selling his eggs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Determine the total number of eggs laid per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's hens lay 252 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs laid per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Lloyd earns from selling these eggs. He sells the eggs for 2 US dollars per dozen. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs he sells per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozen/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
\[ 147 \text{ dozen/week} \times 2 \text{ US dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ US dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount Lloyd earns pro week an the eis is \boxed{294}.",294,294
mgsm-de-51,"To determine how long Tom takes for his return trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Tom traveled during his outward trip.
2. Determine the time it takes for Tom to return with his reduced speed.

First, we know that Tom's speed during the outward trip is 10 miles per hour and he traveled from 13:00 to 16:00, which is a total of 3 hours. Therefore, the distance he traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Tom to travel the same 30 miles back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time required for the return trip is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Thus, the time Tom takes for the return trip is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5
mgsm-de-52,"Let's denote the number of comic books Uriah has as \( C \) and the number of toy figures as \( T \).

Given:
- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
- Each toy figure weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.
- Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag.
- Uriah removes 30 comic books.

First, calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, let \( T \) be the number of toy figures. The total weight of the toy figures is:
\[
T \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{T}{2} \text{ pounds}
\]

The total weight of the books and toy figures combined is:
\[
7.5 + \frac{T}{2} \text{ pounds}
\]

According to the problem, this total weight must be reduced to 15 pounds:
\[
7.5 + \frac{T}{2} = 15
\]

To find \( T \), solve the equation:
\[
\frac{T}{2} = 15 - 7.5
\]
\[
\frac{T}{2} = 7.5
\]
\[
T = 15
\]

So, Uriah has 15 toy figures. Now, we need to determine how many toy figures he must remove to reduce the total weight to 15 pounds.

The current total weight of the comic books and toy figures is 15 pounds, and we need to find out how many toy figures to remove to reach this weight. Since the current total weight is already 15 pounds, no toy figures need to be removed.

Thus, the number of toy figures Uriah must remove is:

2. Calculate the value of the annual retirement benefit after 30 years, including the additional 5% annual benefit.

**Step 1: Calculate the value of the annual retirement benefit after 20 years.**

Marcy's annual retirement benefit is $50,000. After 20 years, the value of this benefit is:
\[ 50,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{20} \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.05)^{20} \):
\[ (1.05)^{20} \approx 2.6533 \]

So, the value of the annual retirement benefit after 20 years is:
\[ 50,000 \times 2.6533 = 132,665 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the value of the annual retirement benefit after 30 years.**

After another 10 years (i.e., after 30 years total), the value of the annual retirement benefit is:

mgsm-de-72,"To determine how much money Tommy has collected, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the Brownies and the Käsekuchenstücke separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from selling the Brownies:
- Tommy sells each Brownie for 3 US dollars.
- He sells 43 Brownies.

The total revenue from Brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ Brownies} \times 3 \text{ US dollars per Brownie} = 129 \text{ US dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the Käsekuchenstücke:
- Tommy sells each Käsekuchenstück for 4 US dollars.
- He sells 23 Käsekuchenstücke.

The total revenue from Käsekuchenstücke is:
\[ 23 \text{ Käsekuchenstücke} \times 4 \text{ US dollars per Käsekuchenstück} = 92 \text{ US dollars} \]

Now, we sum the revenues from both items to find the total amount of money Tommy has collected:
\[ 129 \text{ US dollars} + 92 \text{ US dollars} = 221 \text{ US dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Tommy has collected is:

mgsm-de-73,"To determine how much Shiela pays each month for her five handsets with a 2% interest rate over a 3-month period, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the handsets including the interest.
2. Divide the total cost by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the handsets including the interest. The cost of one handset is $150, and Shiela buys five handsets, so the total cost without interest is:
\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% per month, and the interest is compounded monthly over 3 months. The formula for the total cost with interest is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]
Here, the principal is $750, the interest rate is 0.02, and the number of periods is 3. Plugging in the values, we get:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 750 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 = 750 \times (1.02)^3 \]
Calculating \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 \approx 1.061208 \]
So the total cost is:
\[ 750 \times 1.061208 \approx 795.91 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Shiela pays each month. She pays this total amount over 3 months, so the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{795.91}{3} \approx 265.30 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

Therefore, Shiela pays each month \(\boxed{265.30}\).",30,255

   - Petunien: \(9 \text{ Töpfe} \times 1.87 \text{ USD/Töpf} = 16.83 \text{ USD}\)
   - Begonien: \(17 \text{ Töpfe} \times 2.12 \text{ USD/Töpf} = 36.04 \text{ USD}\)

2. **Round each total revenue to the nearest dollar:**
   - Ringelblumen: \(32.88 \text{ USD} \rightarrow 33 \text{ USD}\)
   - Petunien: \(16.83 \text{ USD} \rightarrow 17 \text{ USD}\)
   - Begonien: \(36.04 \text{ USD} \rightarrow 36 \text{ USD}\)

3. **Sum the rounded revenues to find the total amount earned:**

mgsm-de-75,"To determine the average area of each level of Luke's 4-storied sandcastle, we first need to find the area of each individual level. We know that each level is half the area of the level directly below it. The top level (level 1) has an area of 16 square meters. Therefore, the area of the second level (level 2) is half of 16 square meters, which is 8 square meters. The area of the third level (level 3) is half of 8 square meters, which is 4 square meters. The area of the fourth level (level 4) is half of 4 square meters, which is 2 square meters.

Now, we have the areas of all four levels: 16, 8, 4, and 2 square meters. To find the average area of the levels, we sum these areas and divide by the number of levels:

\[

     \]

4. **Determine the number of Tüten Hundefutter needed:**
   - Each Tüte contains 110 Tassen.
   - Therefore, the number of Tüten needed is:
     \[
     \frac{550 \text{ Tassen}}{110 \text{ Tassen/Tüte}} = 5 \text{ Tüten}

mgsm-de-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers in the better-priced package, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in 3-er-packings versus 2-er-packings.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in 3-er-packings:
- Each 3-er-pack costs 2.50 US dollars.
- To find out how many 3-er-packings are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in 3-er-packings is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15 \text{ US dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in 2-er-packings:
- Each 2-er-pack costs 1 US dollar.
- To find out how many 2-er-packings are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:

From the problem, we know:
- On the first occasion, the alarm clock rang 4 times.
- On the second occasion, it rang for 4 times as long as the first occasion.
- On the third occasion, it rang for half as long as the second occasion.

Let's denote the duration of the alarm ringing on the first occasion as \(D_1\), on the second occasion as \(D_2\), and on the third occasion as \(D_3\).

Given:
\[ A_1 = 4 \]
\[ D_1 = A_1 = 4 \]
\[ D_2 = 4 \times D_1 = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]
\[ D_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times D_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of rings \(A\) by summing up the rings from each occasion:
\[ A = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 \]

Since the duration of the alarm ringing is the same for each ring, the number of rings on each occasion is equal to the duration of the ringing divided by the duration of one ring. However, since the duration of one ring is constant, the number of rings is directly proportional to the duration of ringing.

From the problem, we know:
\[ A_2 = 3 \times A_1 = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]
\[ A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]

Thus, the total number of rings is:

3. James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

Since we know James is 10 years old, we can substitute \( M = 10 \) into the fourth equation:

The cost price per sack is \( \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3} \) dollars, since he buys 20 sacks for 30 dollars.

The cost price for \( n \) sacks is \( \frac{2}{3}n \) dollars.

The selling price per sack is \( \frac{30}{30} = 1 \) dollar, since he sells each sack for 30 dollars.

The selling price for \( n \) sacks is \( n \) dollars.

The trader's profit is given as 400 dollars. Therefore, the profit can be expressed as the selling price minus the cost price:

\[ n - \frac{2}{3}n = 400 \]

To solve for \( n \), we first find a common denominator for the terms on the left side:

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on the 3 entrance tickets:
\[ 20.25 \times 3 = 60.75 \]

Next, we need to find out how much was spent on food. According to the problem, they spent 4.50$ less on food than on entrance tickets:
\[ 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the two different trips on the trains:

Adding up all the expenses gives us the total amount spent:
\[ 60.75 + 56.25 + 66 = 183 \]

Since the expenses are to be divided equally among the three friends, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ \frac{183}{3} = 61 \]

Therefore, each friend paid \(\boxed{61}\).",61,34

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years.
3. Account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.**

Tom plants 10 trees and loses 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of trees after 10 years.**

Tom starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, the number of trees will increase by 8 trees each year. So, the total increase in the number of trees after 10 years is:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Adding this to the initial number of trees:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.**

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. Therefore, 70% of the trees remain. The number of trees that remain is:

   - Mark works on 1000 sentences in total.
   - Let's assume Mark works on \( x \) sentences for Publisher A and \( 1000 - x \) sentences for Publisher B.

2. Determine the rate per sentence for each publisher:
   - Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence.

3. Calculate the total earnings from each publisher:
   - Earnings from Publisher A: \( 5x \) cents.
   - Earnings from Publisher B: \( 10(1000 - x) \) cents.

4. Combine the earnings from both publishers to get the total earnings for the week:

4. Sum the weights from steps 2 and 3 to get the total weight of the Süßigkeitentüte.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since each chocolate bar weighs double the weight of each candied apple, we can find the weight of one candied apple as follows:
\[ \text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of one chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the 25 chocolate bars:

Then, we calculate the total weight of the 80 candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the Süßigkeitentüte:

From the problem, we know:
- 1200 tumblers cost 1200 dollars less than the cost of a half dozen plates.
- Each tumbler costs 6000 dollars.

First, let's express the cost of a half dozen plates in terms of the cost of one plate:
\[ C_P = 6P \]
Since a half dozen plates is 6 plates, we have:
\[ C_P = 6P \]

Next, we know the cost of 1200 tumblers is 1200 dollars less than the cost of a half dozen plates:
\[ 1200T = C_P - 1200 \]
Substituting \( T = 6000 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 1200 \times 6000 = 6P - 1200 \]
\[ 7200000 = 6P - 1200 \]
Adding 1200 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 7201200 = 6P \]
Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
\[ P = 1200200 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one dozen tumblers, which is the cost of 12 tumblers:
\[ C_T = 12T = 12 \times 6000 = 72000 \]

The problem asks for the total cost for one dozen tumblers, which is 72000 dollars. Therefore, the cost of one tumbler is 6000 dollars, and the total cost for one dozen tumblers is:

The cost of the jacket is $30$.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is $2 \times 20 = 40$.
So, the total cost is $30 + 40 = 70$.

Next, we calculate Sara's net earnings per day. She earns $5$ for each day she babysits and $4$ for each day she mows the lawn, so her net earnings per day are $5 + 4 = 9$.

Sara already has $10$ saved. Let \( x \) be the number of days she needs to mow the lawn to save enough money. Her total savings after \( x \) days will be $10 + 9x$. We need this to be at least $70$.

So, we set up the inequality:

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 9x \geq 60 \]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[ x \geq \frac{60}{9} \approx 6.67 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 7. Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 7 times.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know that the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. Then we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250
mgsm-de-214,"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small swimming pool as \( x \) gallons. According to the problem, the large swimming pool currently has four times as much water as the small swimming pool, so the large swimming pool has \( 4x \) gallons of water.

Before 4 minutes ago, the large swimming pool had three times as much water as the small swimming pool (since it had doubled from the current amount of the small pool). Therefore, before 4 minutes ago, the small swimming pool had \( \frac{x}{2} \) gallons of water, and the large swimming pool had \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) gallons of water.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water that has leaked out in the last 4 minutes is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons from each pool.

So, before 4 minutes ago, the small swimming pool had \( \frac{x}{2} - 16 \) gallons, and the large swimming pool had \( x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, before 4 minutes ago, the large swimming pool had double the amount of water as the small swimming pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x - 16 = 2 \left( \frac{x}{2} - 16 \right) \]
\[ x - 16 = x - 32 \]
\[ 0 = -16 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ x - 16 = x - 32 \]
\[ 32 = 16 \]
This indicates that the initial conditions are consistent with the problem's setup. Now, we can determine the current amount of water in the small swimming pool. Since the small swimming pool had \( \frac{x}{2} - 16 \) gallons before 4 minutes ago, and it currently has \( x - 16 \) gallons, we can use the relationship:
\[ x - 16 = 2 \left( \frac{x}{2} - 16 \right) \]
\[ x - 16 = x - 32 \]
\[ 32 = 16 \]
This confirms our setup. Now, we need to find the current amount of water in the small swimming pool:
\[ x - 16 = \frac{x}{2} + 16 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{2} = 32 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 32 \]
\[ x = 64 \]
So, the current amount of water in the small swimming pool is:
\[ x - 16 = 64 - 16 = 48 \]
Therefore, the small swimming pool now has \(\boxed{48}\) gallons of water.",48,8
mgsm-de-215,"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Lori wants to buy. She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. She earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn $352.00. Enclosing the final number:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay back after the 10% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the original amount borrowed to find the rest balance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay back after the 10% interest.**

The original amount borrowed is $2000. The interest rate is 10%, so the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ 2000 + 2000 \times 0.10 = 2000 \times 1.10 = 2200 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.**

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount paid is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total amount paid from the original amount borrowed to find the rest balance.**

The rest balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, the rest balance is \(\boxed{220}\).",220,220

mgsm-de-218,"Let's start by defining the current ages of Adrians Alter, Harriet, and Zack. We know that Harriet is currently 21 years old. According to the problem, Harriet is half as old as Zack, so we can calculate Zack's age as follows:

\[ \text{Harriet's age} = 21 \]
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Next, we know that Adrians Alter is three times as old as Harriet. So, we can calculate Adrians Alter's age as follows:

\[ \text{Adrians Alter's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

Now, we need to find the average age of Adrians Alter, Harriet, and Zack in three years. First, we calculate their ages in three years:

\[ \text{Adrians Alter's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66 \]
\[ \text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \]
\[ \text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \]

The average age in three years is the sum of their ages in three years divided by 3:

\[ \text{Average age in three years} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45

mgsm-de-5,"To determine how much Kylar needs to spend on 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and then the cost of each subsequent glass, taking into account the 60% discount for each additional glass.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.6 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
3. The cost of the third glass is 60% of $3, which is \(0.6 \times 3 = 1.8\) dollars.
4. The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of $1.8, which is \(0.6 \times 1.8 = 1.08\) dollars.

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass forms a geometric sequence where the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.6\). The cost of the \(n\)-th glass is given by \(5 \times (0.6)^{n-1}\).

The total cost for 16 glasses is the sum of the first 16 terms of this geometric sequence. The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

For \(a = 5\), \(r = 0.6\), and \(n = 16\), we have:
\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1-(0.6)^{16}}{1-0.6} = 5 \frac{1-(0.6)^{16}}{0.4} = 12.5 (1-(0.6)^{16}) \]

Now, we need to calculate \((0.6)^{16}\):
\[ (0.6)^{16} \approx 0.00043046721 \]

So,
\[ S_{16} \approx 12.5 (1 - 0.00043046721) = 12.5 \times 0.99956953279 = 12.494619159875 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total cost is approximately $12.49.

Therefore, the amount Kylar must spend is \(\boxed{12.49}\).",49,64

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 miles/hour
   - Distance: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles/hour} = 180 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (first 2 hours of the return journey)
   - Speed: 30 miles/hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 60 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours (half an hour)

mgsm-de-12,"To determine how many years it takes for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this net profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each year, Carlos has 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for 1.50 US-Dollar.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.50 = 10.50\) US-Dollar.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to maintain the tree (including watering and fertilizing) is 3 US-Dollar per year.

Now, we can determine the annual net profit:
- Annual net profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Annual net profit = 10.50 - 3 = 7.50 US-Dollar.

Initially, Carlos incurs a fixed cost of 90 US-Dollar to plant the tree. We need to find out how many years it takes for the accumulated net profit to equal or exceed the initial planting cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start making a profit. The accumulated net profit after \(n\) years is given by:
\[ \text{Accumulated net profit} = 7.50n \]

We need this accumulated profit to be at least equal to the initial cost of planting:
\[ 7.50n \geq 90 \]

Solving for \(n\):
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.50} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it takes at least 12 years for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree. The final answer is:

3. The remaining stomp vacuums after accounting for the green and red houses are \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She sells half of the remaining stomp vacuums at the orange house: \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
5. After selling, she has 5 stomp vacuums left.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

Let's solve this equation step-by-step:

1. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

2. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the fraction:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12

First, let's calculate the amount of water and orange juice in the original 10 liters of orange juice mixture. The mixture contains two-thirds water and one-third orange juice:
- Water in the original 10 liters = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- Orange juice in the original 10 liters = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 10 = \frac{10}{3} \) liters.

After a spill of 1 liter of orange juice, the remaining orange juice is:
- Remaining orange juice = \( \frac{10}{3} - 1 = \frac{10}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \) liters.

The total volume of the mixture after adding 15 liters of pineapple juice is 25 liters (24 liters remaining + 1 liter of spilled orange juice). Since the final mixture is 15 liters of pineapple juice and the rest water, the amount of water in the final mixture is:
- Water in the final mixture = 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters.

Now, we need to find out how much water is in the 24 liters of the final mixture. Since the ratio of water to the total mixture remains constant, we can set up the following proportion:

- The cost of 5 packs of milk is $3 each, so the total is $3 \times 5 = $15.
- The cost of 4 apples is $1.50 each, so the total is $1.50 \times 4 = $6.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of these items:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

Marie has paid a total of 50 US-Dollar. Therefore, the amount spent on pizza is:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

Each pizza box costs $8.50. To find out how many pizza boxes Marie bought, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one pizza box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie has bought 2 pizza boxes. The number of pizza boxes Marie bought is \(\boxed{2}\).",2,2
mgsm-de-26,"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on the clothes, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing separately and then sum these costs.

\[
\text{Total cost of shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \text{ US-Dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hosen (which is the plural form of ""hose"" in English):
Mishka has 3 pairs of hosen, and each pair costs 22.50 US-Dollars.
\[
\text{Total cost of hosen} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \text{ US-Dollars}

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now we can find their current ages:
Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) years
Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\) years

mgsm-de-33,"Let's denote the number of gold coins as \( G \) and the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:

1. Calculate the cost of one yogurt.
2. Determine how many yogurts Terry buys in 30 days.
3. Calculate the total cost for the yogurts bought in 30 days.

First, we calculate the cost of one yogurt. The offer is 5.00 US-Dollar for 4 yogurts. Therefore, the cost of one yogurt is:
\[
\text{Cost of one yogurt} = \frac{5.00 \text{ USD}}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = 1.25 \text{ USD per yogurt}
\]

Next, we determine how many yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. Since Terry buys 2 yogurts per day, in 30 days he buys:
\[
\text{Number of yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}

mgsm-de-37,"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his Lego sets.

He has 13 Lego sets and sells each for 15 US-Dollar.

Total money from Lego sets = 13 sets * 15 US-Dollar/set = 195 US-Dollar

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games.

He buys 8 video games and each costs 20 US-Dollar.

Total money spent on video games = 8 games * 20 US-Dollar/game = 160 US-Dollar

Now, we know that after selling the Lego sets and buying the video games, John has 5 US-Dollar left.

Let's calculate the total amount of money John has after all transactions.

Total money after transactions = Total money from Lego sets - Total money spent on video games + Remaining money
Total money after transactions = 195 US-Dollar - 160 US-Dollar + 5 US-Dollar = 39 US-Dollar

Since we know John has 39 US-Dollar left after all transactions, and he spent 160 US-Dollar on video games, the initial amount of money he had must be:

Initial amount of money = Total money after transactions + Total money spent on video games
Initial amount of money = 39 US-Dollar + 160 US-Dollar = 199 US-Dollar

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets John has left. We know he started with 13 Lego sets and sold all of them. Therefore, he has 0 Lego sets left.

mgsm-de-38,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then find his average speed over the 3 days.

First, let's calculate the distance John runs each day:
- On the first day, John runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Next, we calculate the total distance run each day:
- On the first day, the distance run is \( 3 \text{ hours} \times v \text{ miles per hour} = 3v \text{ miles} \).
- On the second day, the distance run is \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times v \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5v \text{ miles} \).
- On the third day, the distance run is \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times v \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5v \text{ miles} \).

The total distance run in a week is the sum of the distances run each day:
\[ 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v \text{ miles} \]

We know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 6v = 60 \]

Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

So, John runs at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. The total time is 6 hours. Therefore, the time spent running is:
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}

Let's denote the number of Post-it-Notizzettel she bought from the new pack as \( x \). The total number of Post-it-Notizzettel she used at work, including the ones she originally had, is \( 220 \). Therefore, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ P + x - 220 = 23 \]

Since Candice originally had 80 Post-it-Notizzettel, we can substitute \( P \) with 80:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, Candice bought 163 Post-it-Notizzettel from the new pack. The number of Post-it-Notizzettel in the pack she bought is the number she used plus the ones she originally had, which is:

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is 12 times less than the number of cats and dogs together, so \( R = \frac{K + D}{12} \).
- For every dog, there are 2 cats, so \( K = 2D \).

First, we calculate the number of cats:

mgsm-de-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of tomatoes in the last portion of the sauce:**
   - The last portion of the sauce is 32 ounces.

2. **Understand the weight loss of tomatoes:**
   - When tomatoes are cooked, they lose half of their weight.
   - Therefore, if 32 ounces is the final weight, the original weight of the tomatoes before cooking was \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces.

3. **Convert the original weight of tomatoes to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many tomatoes are in 64 ounces, we first determine how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes.",12,12
mgsm-de-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam. Additionally, 5 cars left the traffic jam and did not drive through it. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the entire 30 minutes is given by:
\[ x + (x + 20) - 5 \]

We know that the original number of cars on the highway was 30. After some of them drove through the traffic jam and some left, the number of cars remaining on the highway is:
\[ 30 - (x + 20 - 5) = 30 - (x + 15) = 15 - x \]

Since the number of cars remaining on the highway is also equal to the number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam, which is \( 30 - (x + 20 - 5) = 15 - x \), we can set up the equation:
\[ 15 - x = 15 - x \]

This equation is consistent with our setup, but we need to find the value of \( x \). We know the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + (x + 20) - 5 = 2x + 15 \). Since the number of cars remaining on the highway is \( 15 - x \), we can use the fact that the total number of cars initially minus the number of cars remaining is the number of cars that drove through:
\[ 30 - (15 - x) = 2x + 15 \]
\[ 15 + x = 2x + 15 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{10} \).",10,5

1. Calculate the total number of topfpflanzen Mary currently has.
2. Determine how many topfpflanzen she plans to give away.
3. Subtract the number of topfpflanzen she gives away from the total number she currently has.

First, we know that Mary has 18 new topfpflanzen and already has 2 topfpflanzen on each of the 40 Fenstersimse. So, the total number of topfpflanzen she currently has is:
\[ 18 + 2 \times 40 = 18 + 80 = 98 \]

Next, Mary plans to give away 1 topfpflanze from each of the 40 Fenstersimse, so she will give away:
\[ 40 \text{ topfpflanzen} \]

### Weekdays:
- John drinks 1 glass of water at breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water at lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water at dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on each weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

There are 5 weekdays in a week. Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

### Weekends:
- On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water at dinner.

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we find:

\[ x = 100 \]

Since \( x = 2y \), we can substitute \( x \) with 100 to find \( y \):

2. Determine the distance Julia rowed in 64 seconds.
3. Calculate the amount of water the boot had swallowed.

**Step 1: Calculate the speed at which Julia was rowing.**

Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 4 x 4 x 10 Bretters:
- Each 4 x 4 x 10 Bretter costs $16.
- Therefore, the total cost for 5 Bretters is:
  \[

  \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the wood:
\[
100 + 80 = 180 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Since Sasha has 15 Bretters in total (10 2 x 4 x 10 and 5 4 x 4 x 10), we assume she sells all of them. We need to determine the selling price per piece of wood. However, the problem does not specify the selling price, so we assume she sells each piece at the same price as she bought them, which is the average price of the wood she has.

The average price per piece of wood is:

\]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all 15 pieces of wood:

mgsm-de-118,"Let's denote the number of containers imported on the first day as \( x \). Since each container contains 5 cars, the number of cars imported on the first day is \( 5x \).

On the second day, let the number of containers imported be \( y \). Similarly, the number of cars imported on the second day is \( 5y \).

According to the problem, the total number of cars at the end of the second day is 30. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5x + 5y = 30 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ x + y = 6 \]

This equation tells us that the total number of containers imported over the two days is 6. Since we are asked to find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \). From the equation \( x + y = 6 \), we can solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 6 - x \]

The number of containers imported on the second day is \( y = 6 - x \). To find the specific value of \( y \), we need to determine the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not provide additional constraints to determine \( x \) uniquely, so we can express the answer in terms of \( x \). But since the problem asks for the number of containers imported on the second day, and we know the total number of containers is 6, the number of containers imported on the second day can be any value from 1 to 5 (since \( x \) can be any integer from 1 to 5).

Given the problem's context and the fact that the total number of containers is 6, the most straightforward and typical interpretation is that the number of containers imported on the second day is the complement of the first day's containers. If we assume the simplest case where the first day's containers are 1, then the second day's containers would be 5, and vice versa. However, without loss of generality and based on the problem's structure, we can conclude:

The number of containers imported on the second day is \( 5 \).

Thus, the answer is:

\[ A_{\text{new}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A \]

Given that Adrian's initial salary \( A \) is 40,000 US-Dollar:
\[ A = 40,000 \]

Using this, we can find Lylah's initial salary \( L \):
\[ 40,000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Now, Adrian's salary four years later is:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = 1.4 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \]

Lylah's salary four years later is:
\[ L_{\text{new}} = 1.4L = 1.4 \times \frac{400,000}{13} = \frac{560,000}{13} \approx 43,076.92 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits they brought is \(\boxed{27}\).",27,27
mgsm-de-122,"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the hours Sadie slept on the first three days:**
   - On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
   - On Tuesday, Sadie slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - On Wednesday, Sadie slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - Total for the first three days: \(8 + 6 + 6 = 20\) hours.

2. **Calculate the hours Sadie slept on the next two days:**
   - On Thursday, Sadie slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
   - On Friday, Sadie slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
   - Total for the next two days: \(7 + 7 = 14\) hours.

3. **Calculate the hours Sadie slept on the last two days:**
   - Let the number of hours Sadie slept on Saturday be \(x\).
   - Let the number of hours Sadie slept on Sunday be \(x + 1\).
   - Total for the last two days: \(x + (x + 1) = 2x + 1\).

4. **Set up the equation for the total hours of sleep in a week:**
   - Total hours in a week: \(20 + 14 + (2x + 1) = 35 + 2x\).

5. **Since the total hours of sleep in a week is 7 times the average number of hours per day, we can set up the equation:**
   - Total hours in a week: \(7 \times \text{average hours per day} = 7 \times \left(\frac{20 + 14 + (2x + 1)}{7}\right) = 20 + 14 + (2x + 1) = 35 + 2x\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(35 + 2x = 35 + 2x\), which confirms our setup.

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - The equation \(35 + 2x = 35 + 2x\) is always true, so we need to find \(x\) such that the total hours make sense. Since \(x\) must be a positive integer and the total hours must be consistent, we can assume \(x = 7\) (the maximum possible value for \(x\) without exceeding the total hours of the week).

7. **Calculate the total hours of sleep:**
   - If \(x = 7\), then on Saturday Sadie slept 7 hours and on Sunday she slept 8 hours.
   - Total for the last two days: \(7 + 8 = 15\) hours.
   - Total hours in a week: \(20 + 14 + 15 = 50\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept in the week is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,48
mgsm-de-123,"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break the problem into two parts: the time she runs at 10 miles per hour and the time she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the time Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. Since she can run for 3 hours at this speed, we have:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how much time she has left after the initial 3 hours. The total time available is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distance run at 10 miles per hour to the distance run at 5 miles per hour to get the total distance:
\[ 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

1. **Determine the number of letters Jennie has already franked:**
   Jennie has 30 already franked letters.

2. **Determine the number of letters that need to be franked:**
   Jennie has a total of 60 letters that need to be franked.

3. **Calculate the number of letters that have been franked:**
   Since 30 letters have already been franked, the number of letters that need to be franked is:
   \[
   60 - 30 = 30
   \]

4. **Determine the proportion of letters that have been franked:**
   Jennie franked a third of the letters that need to be franked. Therefore, the number of letters she franked is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of letters Jennie had initially:**
   Since 20 letters have been franked, these 20 letters were part of the initial 60 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Jennie had initially is:
   \[
   20 + 30 = 50
   \]

Thus, the number of letters Jennie had initially is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,10

1. Initially, Julia had some Löffels, but none were plastic.
2. Julia bought a new pack with \( x \) Löffels.
3. Her husband then bought a pack with 5 Löffels and gave them to Julia.
4. Julia used 3 of these new Löffels while preparing the soup.
5. After using the 3 Löffels, Julia had a total of 12 Löffels.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[
\text{Initial Löffels} + x - 3 = 12
\]

Let's denote the initial number of Löffels Julia had as \( y \). Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
y + x - 3 = 12
\]

We need to solve for \( x \). First, isolate \( y + x \):

\[
y + x - 3 + 3 = 12 + 3
\]

\[
y + x = 15
\]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( y \), we focus on the number of Löffels \( x \) in the new pack. We know:

\[
x + 5 - 3 = 12
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
x + 2 = 12
\]

\[
x = 12 - 2
\]

\[
x = 10

mgsm-de-128,"To determine the total amount of money Dillon spends, we need to first find the cost of each type of fruit based on the given relationships and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he buys.

1. Let the cost of one paprika be \( p \) dollars.
2. According to the problem, the cost of one watermelon is three times the cost of one paprika, so the cost of one watermelon is \( 3p \) dollars.
3. The cost of one orange is one-fifth the cost of one watermelon, so the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3p}{5} \) dollars.

Given that each paprika costs 15 dollars, we can substitute \( p = 15 \) into the expressions for the other fruits:
- The cost of one watermelon is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.
- The cost of one orange is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon buys:
- The cost of 4 watermelons is \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.
- The cost of 20 paprikas is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.
- The cost of 10 oranges is \( 10 \times 9 = 90 \) dollars.

mgsm-de-129,"To determine the daily profit of the hospital from the medical consultations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of consultations per day.
2. Determine the total revenue from these consultations.
3. Determine the total cost of these consultations.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of consultations per day.**

The hospital sees 500 patients per day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of patients seen per hour is:
\[ \frac{500 \text{ patients}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{500}{60} \approx 8.33 \text{ patients/hour} \]

The hospital operates 24 hours a day, so the total number of consultations per day is:
\[ 8.33 \text{ patients/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ patients/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from these consultations.**

The hospital charges $200 per patient per hour. Since each patient is seen for 24 minutes (which is 0.4 hours), the revenue per patient per day is:
\[ 200 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars/patient} \]

The total revenue per day is:
\[ 200 \text{ patients/day} \times 80 \text{ dollars/patient} = 16000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total cost of these consultations.**

The hospital pays $150 per patient per hour. Since each patient is seen for 24 minutes (which is 0.4 hours), the cost per patient per day is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ dollars/patient} \]

The total cost per day is:
\[ 200 \text{ patients/day} \times 60 \text{ dollars/patient} = 12000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

The daily profit is:
\[ 16000 \text{ dollars/day} - 12000 \text{ dollars/day} = 4000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Thus, the daily profit of the hospital is \(\boxed{4000}\).",4000,10000

2. There are two times as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ W = 2B \]
\[ B = 2Q \]

First, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ B = 2Q \]

\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

mgsm-de-144,"To determine the weekly profit Kim will make, we need to calculate both the total income and the total expenses, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total income:
- Kim has 3 existing customers and 5 potential customers.
- Each customer requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of rags per week.
- The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of each pack of rags is $5.
- Therefore, the income from each customer per week is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Kim's total income from 8 customers (3 existing + 5 potential) is:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total expenses:
- Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of rags costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost for 8 customers is:
\[ 8 \times (2 + 5) = 8 \times 7 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:
\[ 72 - 56 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the weekly profit Kim will make is \(\boxed{16}\).",16,20
mgsm-de-145,"To determine how many bananas John can harvest in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of bananas harvested over these harvests.

First, we know that John can harvest his bananas every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[
\frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}
\]

Next, we know that John has 100 bananas per hectare and he has 10 hectares of land. Therefore, the total number of bananas per harvest is:
\[
100 \text{ bananas/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ bananas/harvest}
\]

Since John can harvest 1000 bananas per harvest and he can do this 4 times in a year, the total number of bananas he can harvest in a year is:
\[
1000 \text{ bananas/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ bananas/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of bananas John can harvest in a year is \(\boxed{4000}\).",4000,4000

Now, we sum the pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

mgsm-de-147,"To determine how many bees Debra saw returning to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 6 Hours:**
   - Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours.

2. **Next 6 Hours:**
   - Debra saw \( \frac{B}{2} \) bees return to the hive.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of bees that returned in the next 6 hours.

3. **Last 6 Hours:**
   - Debra saw \( 2B \) bees leave the hive.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of bees that left in the last 6 hours.

4. **Bee Dynamics:**
   - Initially, \( B = 30 \).
   - In the next 6 hours, \( R = \frac{B}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees returned.
   - In the last 6 hours, \( L = 2B = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees left.

5. **Calculating the Number of Bees Returning in the Last 6 Hours:**
   - The bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return by the end of the next 6 hours are the ones that Debra saw returning in the last 6 hours.
   - Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned in the next 6 hours.
   - Therefore, the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours but did not return by the end of the next 6 hours is \( 30 - 15 = 15 \).

Thus, Debra saw \( 15 \) bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours.

mgsm-de-150,"To determine who arrives home first and how long the delay is, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from the school to their homes.

First, let's convert the distances to the same unit. Since 1 mile = 5280 feet, we can convert the distances as follows:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel their respective distances:

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 Pommes frites, which totals \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) Pommes frites.
4. After these, the number of Pommes frites left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The bear then ate two-thirds of the remaining Pommes frites, which is \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \). So, the number of Pommes frites left after the bear ate is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants then took 5 Pommes frites, so the number of Pommes frites left is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 5 \).

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Kimo has 3 one-hour courses each day.
- There are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
- Therefore, the total hours per week on these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Kimo has 2 two-hour courses each day.
- There are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday, Thursday).
- Therefore, the total hours per week on these days is:

- There are 12 Zoll in a foot, so each Brötchen is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) foot long.
- Bill has 300 Brötchen, so the total length of the Brötchen is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the Schokoladencroissants:
- Each Schokoladencroissant is 6 Zoll long.
- So each Schokoladencroissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) foot long.
- Bill has 120 Schokoladencroissants, so the total length of the Schokoladencroissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

The price after the first two months will be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \times 1.20 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The price after the next two months (i.e., after 4 months) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.20 = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.80 \text{ dollars} \]

The price after the next two months (i.e., after 6 months) will be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times 1.20 = 28.80 \times 1.20 = 34.56 \text{ dollars} \]

We can see that the price after \( n \) two-month periods is given by:
\[ P_n = 20 \times (1.20)^n \]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we need to find \( P_{18} \):

Therefore, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 10.427 = 208.54 \text{ dollars} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price is:
\[ P_{18} = 208.54 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that Jimmy has 2 dollars more than twice the amount of money Ethel has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ J = 2E + 2 \]
where \( J \) is the amount of money Jimmy has.

Now, we substitute the value of \( E \) into the equation:
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18. The final answer is:

mgsm-de-169,"To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his walking schedule. He walks 20 miles per day, except on weekends when he walks 10 miles each day.

First, let's calculate the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday. Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, we can calculate the total miles for these days as follows:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the total miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday. Since he walks 10 miles each day on the weekend, we can calculate the total miles for these two days as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles walked from Monday to Friday to the miles walked on Saturday and Sunday to get the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]",120,120

1. **Cost of the Hut:**
   The cost of the hut is given as 25 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hut} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the Jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hut.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}

   Each spider has 8 legs.
   \[
   80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 640 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of legs for the 90 insects:
   Each insect has 6 legs.

mgsm-de-172,"Let's denote the ages of the birds as follows:
- Sally Two: \( S_2 \)
- Granny Red: \( G_R \)
- Sally Four: \( S_4 \)
- Sally Thirtytwo: \( S_32 \)

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red:
   \[
   S_2 = G_R + 3
   \]
2. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four:
   \[
   G_R = 2S_4
   \]
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo:
   \[
   S_4 = S_32
   \]
4. Sally Thirtytwo is eight years older than Sally Four:
   \[
   S_32 = S_4 + 8
   \]

Since \( S_4 = S_32 \), we can substitute \( S_32 \) with \( S_4 \) in the equation \( S_32 = S_4 + 8 \):
\[
S_4 = S_4 + 8
\]
This implies:
\[
0 = 8
\]
This is a contradiction, indicating there might be a misunderstanding in the setup. Let's re-evaluate the relationships.

Given \( S_4 = S_32 \) and \( S_32 = S_4 + 8 \), we can directly substitute:
\[
S_4 = S_4 + 8
\]
This is still a contradiction, suggesting a need to recheck the problem statement. Let's assume the correct interpretation is:
\[
S_4 = S_32 \quad \text{and} \quad S_32 = S_4 + 8 \implies S_4 = S_4 + 8 \implies \text{No contradiction, recheck values.}
\]

Given \( S_4 = S_32 \), we can use the second relationship to find \( G_R \):
\[
G_R = 2S_4
\]
And using the first relationship:
\[
S_2 = G_R + 3 = 2S_4 + 3
\]

Now, let's find the total age of the four birds:
\[
S_2 + G_R + S_4 + S_32 = (2S_4 + 3) + 2S_4 + S_4 + S_4 = 6S_4 + 3
\]

Since \( S_4 = S_32 \), we need to find a consistent value for \( S_4 \). Given the problem constraints, let's assume a reasonable age for \( S_4 \) that fits all relationships. Let's try \( S_4 = 4 \):
\[
S_32 = 4, \quad G_R = 2 \times 4 = 8, \quad S_2 = 2 \times 4 + 3 = 11
\]

Thus, the total age is:
\[
S_2 + G_R + S_4 + S_32 = 11 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 27
\]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{27}\).",27,51

1. Calculate the minimum monthly payments for each debt.
2. Determine the increased monthly payments (50% more than the minimum).
3. Calculate the total annual payment based on the increased monthly payments.

**Step 1: Minimum monthly payments**

- Student loan: 300 $/month
- Credit card: 200 $/month
- Hypothec: 500 $/month

**Step 2: Increased monthly payments**

- Increased student loan: \( 300 \times 1.5 = 450 \) $/month

mgsm-de-175,"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to calculate their total revenue and total cost, and then use the profit to find the cost of lemons.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they make.
- The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars (3 dollars for lemons and 2 dollars for sugar).
- They sell 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
- The profit is given as 25 dollars.

The profit can be expressed as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost for the lemons is:

Let's start with the given monthly income of Zaid:
\[ \text{Monthly income} = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on rent.**
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on gasoline.**
\[ \text{Gasoline} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after rent and gasoline.**
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the amount donated to charity.**
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

mgsm-de-184,"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

**Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.**

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[
0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]
So, the probability in percentage is \( \boxed{50} \).

**Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.**

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

After rolling an even number, the probability of rolling an even number again is also \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

So, the probability in percentage is \( \boxed{25} \).

**Step 3: Compare the probabilities.**

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 is \( \boxed{25} \% \) more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.",25,25

   - There are 10 Käfige with ratten.
   - The total number of Strohhalme given to the ratten is 160.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of ratten in each cage. Then the total number of ratten is \( 10n \).
   - The total number of Strohhalme given to the ratten can be expressed as \( 6 \times 10n = 160 \).

2. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   6 \times 10n = 160

   \[
   60n = 160
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{160}{60} = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be a whole number, and the problem setup implies an integer solution, we need to recheck the problem constraints or assumptions. However, given the problem's context, it seems the setup is correct and we should consider the integer part, but typically such problems assume whole numbers, so we should recheck the problem constraints or context for any misinterpretation.

3. **Recheck the problem constraints:**
   - The problem states that each ratten gets 6 Strohhalme and there are 10 Käfige with 160 Strohhalme.
   - This implies \( n = 2 \) (since \( 6 \times 10 \times 2 = 120 \) is close but not 160, and the problem likely assumes an exact integer solution).

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - If \( n = 2 \), then each cage has 2 ratten.
   - The total number of ratten is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \).
   - The total number of Strohhalme given to the ratten is \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \), which is close but not 160. Given the problem's context, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or rounding issue, but the integer solution is typically assumed.

polymath-low-de-35,"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points scored in each 20-minute segment and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Points in first 20 minutes} = 4 \]

Next, we need to find out how many points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
\[ \text{Points in second 20 minutes} = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both segments to find the total number of points Mike scored:
\[ \text{Total points} = 4 + 5 = 9 \]

polymath-low-de-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurts within 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of one yogurt.
2. Calculate the cost for 2 yogurts per day.
3. Calculate the total cost for 30 days.

First, let's find the cost of one yogurt. The yogurts are sold for $5.00 for 4 yogurts. Therefore, the cost of one yogurt is:
\[
\text{Cost of one yogurt} = \frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Next, since Terry buys 2 yogurts per day, the cost of 2 yogurts per day is:
\[
\text{Cost of 2 yogurts per day} = 2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Now, to find the total cost for 30 days, we multiply the daily cost by 30:
\[
\text{Total cost for 30 days} = 2.50 \times 30 = 75.00 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Thus, the total amount Terry spends on yogurts within 30 days is:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his Lego-Sets.
2. Calculate the total amount of money John spends on the Videospiele.
3. Determine the total amount of money John has after selling the Lego-Sets and buying the Videospiele.
4. Use the information about the remaining money to find out how much money John actually spent on the Videospiele.
5. Determine how many Lego-Sets John has left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. John sells 13 Lego-Sets at $15 each.
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ US-Dollar}
   \]

2. John buys 8 Videospiele at $20 each.
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ US-Dollar}
   \]

3. John has $5 left after these transactions.
   \[
   \text{Total money spent} = 195 - 5 = 190 \text{ US-Dollar}
   \]

4. The total money spent on the Videospiele is $160, and the total money spent plus the remaining $5 should equal $190.
   \[
   160 + 5 = 165 \text{ US-Dollar}
   \]
   However, we already know the total money spent is $190, so the remaining $5 is consistent with the problem statement.

5. Since John spent $190 in total and he spent $160 on Videospiele, the number of Lego-Sets sold is correct. The number of Lego-Sets left is:
   \[
   13 - 0 = 13
   \]

So, the number of Lego-Sets that remain with John is \boxed{13}.",13,2
polymath-low-de-38,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to first find out how many miles he runs each day and then calculate his speed.

1. Calculate the total running time per week:
   John runs 3 hours on the first day and half that time (1.5 hours) on each of the other two days. So, the total running time per week is:
   \[
   3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance run each day:
   John runs 60 miles per week. Since he runs for 6 hours per week, we can find his speed (distance per hour) by dividing the total distance by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}

1. **Determine Dana's jumping speed:**
   Dana can jump at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   Dana can run four times as fast as she can jump. Therefore, her running speed is:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   Dana can walk half as fast as she can run. Therefore, her walking speed is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the time distribution:**
   Dana spends one-third of her time jumping and two-thirds of her time walking. The total time is 6 hours. Therefore, the time spent jumping is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   And the time spent walking is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance covered while jumping:**
   The distance covered while jumping in 2 hours is:

polymath-low-de-41,"Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the golden spear without the Saphir-Edelstein as \( d \). According to the problem, \( d = 400 \) feet.

When Polly holds the Saphir-Edelstein, she can throw the golden spear three times as far. Therefore, the distance she can throw the spear with the Saphir-Edelstein is \( 3d \).

We need to find the maximum distance outside the 1000-foot radius of the Drachen Perg's flames that Polly can throw the spear with the Saphir-Edelstein.

First, calculate \( 3d \):
\[
3d = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
\]

The Drachen Perg's flames have a 1000-foot radius. Therefore, the maximum distance outside this radius is:

1. Calculate the number of calories left to be consumed.
2. Determine how many calories are in one portion of chips.
3. Calculate how many portions can be consumed with the remaining calories.
4. Convert the number of portions into grams.

First, we find out how many calories are left to be consumed:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we know that one portion of chips contains 250 calories. We need to find out how many portions can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/portion}} = \frac{4}{5} \text{ portion} \]

Since one portion is 500 grams (because 300 grams is 5 portions):
\[ \frac{4}{5} \text{ portion} \times 500 \text{ grams/portion} = 400 \text{ grams} \]

So, the number of grams you can eat is:

1. Calculate the number of blue Krawatten John bought.
2. Calculate the number of red Krawatten John bought.
3. Calculate the cost of the red Krawatten.
4. Sum the total cost of the blue and red Krawatten.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blue Krawatten John bought.**

John spent 200 US-Dollars on blue Krawatten, and each blue Krawatten costs 40 US-Dollars.
\[
\text{Number of blue Krawatten} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of red Krawatten John bought.**

John bought twice as many red Krawatten as blue Krawatten.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books:
- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
- Therefore, the total weight of 30 comic books is:
  \[
  30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight is left to be removed from the book bag after removing the 30 comic books:
- The total weight of the book bag is 15 pounds.
- The weight of the comic books removed is 7.5 pounds.
- Therefore, the remaining weight to be removed is:
  \[
  15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we need to determine how many toy figures (each weighing \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound) are required to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds:
- Let \( x \) be the number of toy figures to be removed.
- Each toy figure weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, so the total weight of \( x \) toy figures is:
  \[
  x \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \text{ pounds}
  \]
- We set this equal to the remaining weight to be removed:
  \[
  \frac{x}{2} = 7.5
  \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
x = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

polymath-low-de-58,"To determine the total cost of Stephen's online food order, we need to account for the base amount, the delivery fee, the service fee, and the tip. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Base Amount**: The base cost of the food is $40.00.
2. **Service Fee**: The service fee is 25% of the base amount.
   \[
   \text{Service Fee} = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]
3. **Delivery Fee**: The delivery fee is $3.00.
4. **Tip**: The tip is $4.00.

Now, we sum up all these amounts to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Amount} + \text{Service Fee} + \text{Delivery Fee} + \text{Tip}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 40.00 + 10.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 57.00

polymath-low-de-60,"To determine how many oranges are good, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of oranges.
2. Determine the number of bad oranges.
3. Calculate the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad oranges from the total number of oranges.

Given:
- Total number of oranges = 25
- Number of bad oranges = 2 (sour and one bad)
- Number of unreripe oranges = 20% of 25 = \(0.20 \times 25 = 5\)

Since the bad oranges are a subset of the sour and bad oranges, we need to ensure we are not double-counting any oranges. The number of good oranges can be calculated as follows:

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Number of bad oranges
Number of good oranges = 25 - 2 = 23

Thus, the number of good oranges is \(\boxed{23}\).",23,17

polymath-low-de-62,"To determine Marcy's annual retirement income after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of the annual retirement income after 20 years, including the 5% annual increase.
2. Calculate the value of the annual retirement income after 30 years, including the 5% annual increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the value of the annual retirement income after 20 years.**

The initial annual retirement income is $50,000. After 20 years, the income increases by 5% each year. The formula for the future value of a growing annuity is:

\[ FV = P \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right) \]

where \( P \) is the initial payment, \( r \) is the growth rate, and \( n \) is the number of periods.

Here, \( P = 50,000 \), \( r = 0.05 \), and \( n = 20 \).

\[ FV_{20} = 50,000 \left( \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{20} - 1}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{20} = 50,000 \left( \frac{(1.05)^{20} - 1}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{20} = 50,000 \left( \frac{2.6533 - 1}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{20} = 50,000 \left( \frac{1.6533}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{20} = 50,000 \times 33.066 \]
\[ FV_{20} = 1,653,300 \]

So, after 20 years, Marcy's annual retirement income is $1,653,300.

**Step 2: Calculate the value of the annual retirement income after 30 years.**

Now, the annual income of $1,653,300 will grow by 5% each year for the next 10 years.

Using the same future value of a growing annuity formula, where \( P = 1,653,300 \), \( r = 0.05 \), and \( n = 10 \):

\[ FV_{30} = 1,653,300 \left( \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{10} - 1}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{30} = 1,653,300 \left( \frac{(1.05)^{10} - 1}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{30} = 1,653,300 \left( \frac{1.6289 - 1}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{30} = 1,653,300 \left( \frac{0.6289}{0.05} \right) \]
\[ FV_{30} = 1,653,300 \times 12.578 \]
\[ FV_{30} = 20,858,985.40 \]

So, after 30 years, Marcy's annual retirement income is $20,858,985.40.

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   The cost for the first half of the year is the monthly cost multiplied by 6 months.
   \[
   140 \text{ USD/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ USD}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   The cost for the second half of the year is the monthly cost minus 10%, which is then multiplied by 6 months.
   \[
   140 \text{ USD/month} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ USD/month} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ USD/month}
   \]
   \[
   126 \text{ USD/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ USD}

1. **Number of Diamonds:**
   The number of diamonds is given as 175.

2. **Number of Rubies:**
   The number of rubies is 35 less than the number of diamonds. Therefore, we calculate the number of rubies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140

polymath-low-de-68,"Let's denote the number of girls as \( G \) and the number of boys as \( B \). According to the problem, there are 60 girls, so \( G = 60 \). It is also given that there are twice as many boys as girls, so \( B = 2G \). Substituting the value of \( G \) into the equation for \( B \), we get:

\[ B = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we know that there are 5 students per teacher. The total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and boys:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = G + B = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Since there are 5 students per teacher, the number of teachers \( T \) is given by the total number of students divided by the number of students per teacher:

\[ T = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Thus, the number of teachers is \( 36 \), and the final answer is:

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in 3-er-packings:
- Each 3-er-pack costs 2.50 US-Dollar.
- To find out how many 3-er-packings are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 6 packings is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15 \text{ US-Dollar}

First, we calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. Since John has 20 friends and each friend will get 4 slices, the total number of slices required is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 8-slice pizzas are required to provide 80 slices. We do this by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas.",10,10
mgsm-de-236,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many new Stifte Ram kann machen, wenn er die Tinte von fünf leeren Stiften mischt, um einen Stift voll zu machen.

1. Ram hat 25 Stifte zu beginn.
2. Wenn er einen Stift verwendet, entstehen 5 leere Stifte, die er dann mischen kann, um einen neuen Stift zu machen.
3. Jeder neue Stift, den er macht, reduziert die Anzahl der leeren Stifte um 5, was bedeutet, dass er 5 leere Stifte zu leeren Stiften macht, wenn er einen neuen Stift macht.
4. Wenn er 25 Stifte hat, kann er 5 neue Stifte machen, indem er die Tinte von 25 leeren Stiften mischt.
5. Nachdem er diese 5 neuen Stifte gemacht hat, hat er 20 leere Stifte (25 - 5 = 20).
6. Er kann nun wieder 5 neue Stifte machen, indem er die Tinte von diesen 20 leeren Stiften mischt.
7. Nachdem er diese 5 neuen Stifte gemacht hat, hat er 15 leere Stifte (20 - 5 = 15).
8. Er kann nun wieder 5 neue Stifte machen, indem er die Tinte von diesen 15 leeren Stiften mischt.
9. Nachdem er diese 5 neuen Stifte gemacht hat, hat er 10 leere Stifte (15 - 5 = 10).
10. Er kann nun wieder 5 neue Stifte machen, indem er die Tinte von diesen 10 leeren Stiften mischt.
11. Nachdem er diese 5 neuen Stifte gemacht hat, hat er 5 leere Stifte (10 - 5 = 5).
12. Er kann nun wieder 5 neue Stifte machen, indem er die Tinte von diesen 5 leeren Stiften mischt.
13. Nachdem er diese 5 neuen Stifte gemacht hat, hat er 0 leere Stifte (5 - 5 = 0).

Insgesamt hat Ram 25 (ursprüngliche Stifte) + 5 (neue Stifte) = 30 Stifte.

The final answer is $\boxed{30}$.",30,31

1. We know that Jessa is 20 years old.
2. Joan is 5 years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
\text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68

1. Calculate the number of students who exited through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students who exited through exit B.
3. Determine the number of students who exited through exit C.

First, we know that 30% of the students exited through exit A. The total number of students is 1000.

\[ \text{Number of students exiting through A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After students exit through exit A, the number of students remaining is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we know that \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students exited through exit B. So, we calculate the number of students exiting through exit B:

\[ \text{Number of students exiting through B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

After students exit through exit B, the number of students remaining is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students exited through exit C. Therefore, the number of students exiting through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

mgsm-de-240,"Let's denote the number of bonbons Robert has as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. James has 6 more bonbons than Robert, so James has \( R + 6 \) bonbons.
2. John has twice as many bonbons as Robert, so John has \( 2R \) bonbons.
3. John has 54 bonbons, so we can set up the equation \( 2R = 54 \).

Solving for \( R \):
\[
2R = 54 \implies R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

Now we know Robert has 27 bonbons. Therefore, James has:
\[
R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \text{ bonbons}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more bonbons John has than James:
\[
2R - (R + 6) = 27 - 33 = -6

mgsm-de-242,"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters per week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of people Mike is still sending and receiving letters from:**
   - Initially, Mike has 5 people as friends.
   - He stops being friends with 2 people, so he is still friends with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.
   - Therefore, he is sending and receiving letters from 3 people.

2. **Calculate the total number of letters Mike sends and receives per week:**
   - Each of the 3 people sends 2 letters per week, so Mike sends \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters per week.
   - Each of the 3 people receives 2 letters per week, so Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters per week.
   - Therefore, Mike sends and receives a total of \(6 + 6 = 12\) letters per week.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week:**
   - Each letter is 2 pages long, so Mike writes \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pages per week.

4. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week:**
   - Mike can write 1 page in 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, he spends \(24 \times 6 = 144\) minutes per week writing.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of hours Mike spends writing per week is \(\frac{144}{60} = 2.4\) hours.

Thus, the number of hours Mike spends writing per week is \(\boxed{2.4}\).",4,3

3. Calculate the total payment before the discount.
4. Calculate the discount amount.
5. Calculate the final payment after the discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jean spends on the make-up each week.**

Jean spends 6 hours each day for 4 days a week.
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Jean spends on the make-up over the 5 weeks.**

First, let's calculate the calories consumed by Sue's sister:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 Kekse.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 Kekse.
- Each Kekse has 200 calories.

The total calories consumed by Sue's sister is:
\[ 5 \times 200 + 13 \times 200 = 1000 + 2600 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories consumed by Sue:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many Kekse as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 Kekse, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) Kekse.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many Kekse as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 Kekse, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) Kekse.
- Each Kekse has 200 calories.

The total calories consumed by Sue is:
\[ 20 \times 200 + 26 \times 200 = 4000 + 5200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day.
2. Determine the number of eggs left after her daily usage.
3. Calculate the daily revenue from selling the remaining eggs.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet uses each day:
- Janet eats 3 eggs every morning.
- She makes 4 muffins every day, and each muffin typically uses 2 eggs (since 4 muffins use 8 eggs, and 8 eggs / 4 muffins = 2 eggs per muffin).

So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 \text{ (eaten)} + 4 \times 2 \text{ (used in muffins)} = 3 + 8 = 11 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs left after her daily usage:
\[ 16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 11 \text{ (used eggs)} = 5 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we determine the daily revenue from selling the remaining eggs:
\[ 5 \text{ (remaining eggs)} \times 2 \text{ (dollars per egg)} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Janet makes daily from selling the remaining eggs is:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house including the initial purchase price and the repair costs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the 150% increase.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house.**

The initial cost of the house is $80,000. Josh then spends $50,000 on repairs.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the 150% increase.**

A 150% increase means the value of the house is multiplied by 2.5 (since 150% = 1.5, and 1 + 1.5 = 2.5).
\[
\text{New value} = 130,000 \times 2.5 = 325,000 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost.
\[

2. Determine the amount of feed provided in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed to find the feed for the last meal.

First, let's find the total amount of feed provided in a day. Wendi feeds 20 hens, and each hen gets 3 tasses of feed per day. Therefore, the total daily feed is:
\[ 20 \text{ hens} \times 3 \text{ tasses/hen} = 60 \text{ tasses} \]

Next, we know that Wendi feeds the hens in three separate meals. The morning feed is 15 tasses and the afternoon feed is 25 tasses. So, the total feed for the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ tasses} + 25 \text{ tasses} = 40 \text{ tasses} \]

Now, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed to find the feed for the last meal:

polymath-low-de-5,"To determine the total cost Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the subsequent glasses, which have a progressively decreasing price.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.6 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
3. The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is \(0.6 \times 3 = 1.8\) dollars.
4. The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.8, which is \(0.6 \times 1.8 = 1.08\) dollars.

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass forms a geometric sequence where the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.6\).

The total cost for 16 glasses can be calculated as the sum of the first term and the sum of the next 15 terms of this geometric sequence. The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

For the first 16 terms:
\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1-0.6^{16}}{1-0.6} = 5 \frac{1-0.6^{16}}{0.4} = 12.5 (1-0.6^{16}) \]

Now, we need to calculate \(0.6^{16}\):
\[ 0.6^{16} \approx 0.00043 \]
So,
\[ S_{16} = 12.5 (1 - 0.00043) = 12.5 \times 0.99957 \approx 12.494625 \]

polymath-low-de-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this net profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each year, Carlos harvests 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for 1.50 US-Dollar.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.50 = 10.50\) US-Dollar.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to maintain the tree (including watering and fertilizing) is 3 US-Dollar per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit per year by subtracting the maintenance cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Maintenance cost
- Net profit per year = 10.50 - 3 = 7.50 US-Dollar.

The initial cost of planting the tree is 90 US-Dollar. To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to recover this initial cost, we need to divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
- Number of years to recover initial cost = Initial cost / Net profit per year
- Number of years to recover initial cost = 90 / 7.50 = 12.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making a profit from his lemon tree. The final answer is:

2. Determine the amount of water and ananasgetränk in the additional 5 liters of ananasgetränk.
3. Account for the loss of 1 liter of orange juice during the mixing process.
4. Calculate the total amount of water in the final mixture.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water and orange juice in the original 10 liters of orange juice.**

- Two-thirds of the 10 liters is water:
  \[
  \text{Water in original orange juice} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}
  \]
- One-third of the 10 liters is orange juice:
  \[
  \text{Orange juice in original orange juice} = 10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ liters}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of water and ananasgetränk in the additional 5 liters of ananasgetränk.**

- Three-fifths of the 5 liters is water:
  \[
  \text{Water in additional ananasgetränk} = \frac{3}{5} \times 5 = 3 \text{ liters}
  \]
- Two-fifths of the 5 liters is ananasgetränk:
  \[
  \text{Ananasgetränk in additional ananasgetränk} = 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ liters}
  \]

**Step 3: Account for the loss of 1 liter of orange juice during the mixing process.**

- The original 10 liters of orange juice now becomes 9 liters (10 liters minus 1 liter lost):
  \[
  \text{Orange juice in final mixture} = \frac{10}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ liters}

1. Raymond was 6 years older than Samantha when Raymond was born.
2. Raymond is now 23 years old.
3. Samantha is now 31 years old.

First, we calculate Raymond's age when he was born:
\[ \text{Raymond's age when he was born} = 23 - 6 = 17 \]
This means Raymond was 17 years old when Samantha was born.

Next, we determine the age difference between Raymond and Samantha:
\[ \text{Age difference} = 23 - 31 = -8 \]
This indicates that Samantha is 8 years older than Raymond.

Since Raymond was 17 years old when Samantha was born, we can find out Samantha's age when Raymond's son was born:
\[ \text{Samantha's age when Raymond's son was born} = 17 + 8 = 25 \]
Raymond's son was born when Samantha was 25 years old.

Now, we calculate how many years ago Raymond's son was born:

polymath-low-de-82,"To determine the total weight of Grace and Alex, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on Grace's weight.
3. Add Grace's and Alex's weights together.

First, we know Grace's weight is 125 pounds. Let's denote Grace's weight as \( G \). So, \( G = 125 \) pounds.

Next, we need to find Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express Alex's weight as:
\[ A = 4G - 2 \]

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team has 8 more wins than losses.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of losses \( L \), we can find the number of wins \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

First, we know that each adult eats 10 pounds of Kartoffelsalat. Therefore, the total amount of Kartoffelsalat consumed by the 20 adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that each juvenile eats half as much as an adult. Therefore, each juvenile eats:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
So, the total amount of Kartoffelsalat consumed by the 5 juveniles is:
\[ 5 \text{ juveniles} \times 5 \text{ pounds/juvenile} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts consumed by the adults and the juveniles gives us the total amount of Kartoffelsalat Ted needs to bring:

1. **Determine Lee's original speed:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Therefore, Lee's speed \( v_L \) is:
     \[
     v_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

2. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   - Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is 38 seconds.

3. **Determine the original time for Gerald:**
   - Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time \( t_G \) is:
     \[
     t_G = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Determine Gerald's original speed:**
   - Gerald's original speed \( v_G \) is:

According to the problem, the number of cars that drove through the first 15 minutes plus the number of cars that drove through the next 15 minutes minus the number of cars that left the line equals the original number of cars minus the number of cars that did not drive through the first 15 minutes. 

So, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ x + (x + 20) - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 7.5 \]

Since the number of cars must be a whole number, and the problem context suggests we should consider the closest whole number, we can infer that the problem is designed such that the solution is a whole number. Given the setup, the closest whole number that fits the context is 7 or 8. However, since the problem setup and the arithmetic lead to 7.5, and typically such problems assume whole numbers, we can conclude the closest whole number fitting the context is 7.

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{7}\).",7,5

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: Let's denote the number of 30-minute shows as \( x \). Therefore, he watched \( 30x \) minutes or \( \frac{30x}{60} = \frac{x}{2} \) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour (1-hour show) + 0.5 hour (30-minute show) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours (2 * 1-hour shows)

Now, we sum up the hours for each day:
\[ 1 + 1 + \frac{x}{2} + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \]

So the equation simplifies to:
\[ 5.5 + \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 1.5 \]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 3 \]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 30-minute shows on Wednesday. The number of 30-minute shows is \(\boxed{3}\).",3,3
polymath-low-de-108,"Let's denote the number of Kekse Henry wanted to bake this year as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he wanted, so he baked \( 2x \) Kekse. We know that he ended up with 15 more Kekse than he wanted, so he had \( x + 15 \) Kekse after baking. However, he lost 5 Kekse when he took them out to cool, and then he had 110 Kekse left. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we find:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry wanted to bake 100 Kekse this year. Since he actually baked twice as many as he wanted, he baked \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \) Kekse. Therefore, the number of Kekse Henry baked last year is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]",100,50
polymath-low-de-109,"To determine the cost of 10 gallons of gasoline after applying the 20 US-Dollar refund, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline before the refund.
2. Subtract the refund from the total cost.

First, we calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 3.00 \text{ US-Dollar per gallon} = 30 \text{ US-Dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the 20 US-Dollar refund from the total cost:
\[ 30 \text{ US-Dollars} - 20 \text{ US-Dollars} = 10 \text{ US-Dollars} \]

Thus, after applying the refund, the cost of 10 gallons of gasoline is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]",10,28
polymath-low-de-110,"To determine the average number of fruit rolls eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of fruit rolls each of them ate and then find the average of these totals.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit rolls Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's fruit rolls are 24 rolls long and 2 rolls wide.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit rolls Beatrice ate is:
  \[
  24 \times 2 = 48
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit rolls Marcell ate:
- Marcell's fruit rolls are 14 rolls long and 3 rolls wide.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit rolls Marcell ate is:
  \[
  14 \times 3 = 42
  \]

Now, we need to find the average number of fruit rolls eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice:
- The total number of fruit rolls eaten by both is:
  \[
  48 + 42 = 90
  \]
- The average number of fruit rolls eaten is:
  \[
  \frac{90}{2} = 45

Thus, the average number of fruit rolls eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
polymath-low-de-111,"To determine how much water Julia's boot had swallowed by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the speed at which Julia was rowing the boat.
2. Determine the total distance Julia had to row.
3. Calculate the total amount of water the boat had swallowed based on the distance rowed and the rate of water intake.

**Step 1: Calculate the speed at which Julia was rowing the boat.**

Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total distance Julia had to row.**

The distance to the shore is 64 seconds. Since Julia's speed is 1.25 feet per second, the total distance she rowed is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water the boat had swallowed.**

The boat swallows 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water swallowed is:
\[ \text{Water swallowed} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water the boat had swallowed by the time Julia reached the shore is:

polymath-low-de-112,"To determine how often the chalkboard is wiped per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chalkboard usages per day:**
   - There are 4 teachers sharing the chalkboard.
   - Each teacher has 2 classes per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of classes per day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ classes per teacher} = 8 \text{ classes per day}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of chalkboard usages per day:**
   - Each class uses the chalkboard for 2 periods.
   - Therefore, the total number of chalkboard usages per day is:
     \[
     8 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ periods per class} = 16 \text{ periods per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of times the chalkboard is wiped per day:**
   - The chalkboard is wiped 3 times per period.
   - Therefore, the total number of times the chalkboard is wiped per day is:
     \[
     16 \text{ periods per day} \times 3 \text{ wipes per period} = 48 \text{ wipes per day}
     \]

Thus, the chalkboard is wiped $\boxed{48}$ times per day.",48,24
polymath-low-de-113,"To determine how many flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days.
2. Subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted.

First, we calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days. Since Ryan plants 2 flowers per day, we multiply the number of days by the number of flowers planted per day:
\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted. According to the problem, 5 flowers did not grow:
\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days is:

polymath-low-de-114,"Let's denote the number of photos that Brittanys' phone can store as \( B \) and the number of ducks shown on Jamal's photo as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittanys' phone. Given that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, we can write:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

The problem also states that the number of photos on Jamal's phone is 50 times the number of ducks on his photo. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 1800 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{1800}{50} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks shown on Jamal's photo is 36. Since the number of ducks on Jamal's photo corresponds to the number of ducks in the zoo, the number of ducks in the zoo is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]",36,6
polymath-low-de-115,"To determine the total profit Sasha makes from selling all the wood, we need to calculate the total cost of the wood she has and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 2 x 4 x 10 Bretters:
- Each 2 x 4 x 10 Bretter costs 10 US-Dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for 10 Bretters is:
  \[
  10 \text{ Bretters} \times 10 \text{ US-Dollars/Bretter} = 100 \text{ US-Dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 4 x 4 x 10 Bretters:
- Each 4 x 4 x 10 Bretter costs 16 US-Dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for 5 Bretters is:
  \[
  5 \text{ Bretters} \times 16 \text{ US-Dollars/Bretter} = 80 \text{ US-Dollars}
  \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the wood:
\[
100 \text{ US-Dollars} + 80 \text{ US-Dollars} = 180 \text{ US-Dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the wood. We need to know the selling price per piece of wood. Since the problem does not specify the selling price, we assume that the selling price is the same as the original purchase price for simplicity. Therefore, we will use the original purchase prices.

The total number of pieces of wood is:
\[
10 \text{ Bretters} + 5 \text{ Bretters} = 15 \text{ pieces}
\]

Assuming the selling price per piece is the same as the original purchase price:
- Each 2 x 4 x 10 Bretter is sold for 10 US-Dollars.
- Each 4 x 4 x 10 Bretter is sold for 16 US-Dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 Bretters is:
  \[
  10 \text{ Bretters} \times 10 \text{ US-Dollars/Bretter} = 100 \text{ US-Dollars}
  \]
- The total revenue from selling 5 Bretters is:
  \[
  5 \text{ Bretters} \times 16 \text{ US-Dollars/Bretter} = 80 \text{ US-Dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the wood is:
  \[
  100 \text{ US-Dollars} + 80 \text{ US-Dollars} = 180 \text{ US-Dollars}
  \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
180 \text{ US-Dollars} - 180 \text{ US-Dollars} = 0 \text{ US-Dollars}
\]

Thus, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{0}\).",0,90
polymath-low-de-116,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of teelöffel of sugar Katy used based on the given ratio and total amount of sugar used.

The ratio of teelöffel of sugar to tassen of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 parts (teelöffel of sugar + tassen of water). Since the ratio of sugar to the total parts is 7 out of 20, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of teelöffel of sugar used:

\[
\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \text{number of teelöffel of sugar}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

So, the number of teelöffel of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes John bought.
2. Determine the total cost based on the price per pair.

First, John has 3 children, and he bought 2 pairs of shoes for each child. Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is:
\[ 3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs/child} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Next, each pair of shoes costs 60 US-Dollars. So, the total cost for 6 pairs of shoes is:
\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ US-Dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ US-Dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount John has paid is:

polymath-low-de-118,"Let's denote the number of containers delivered on the first day as \( x \). Since each container contains 5 cars, the number of cars delivered on the first day is \( 5x \).

On the second day, let's denote the number of containers delivered as \( y \). Therefore, the number of cars delivered on the second day is \( 5y \).

According to the problem, after the second day, the total number of cars at the harbor is 30. This means the sum of the cars from the first and second days is 30. So we can write the equation:

\[ 5x + 5y = 30 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ x + y = 6 \]

We need to find the value of \( y \), the number of containers delivered on the second day. To do this, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 6 - x \]

Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, we need to find a value for \( x \) that makes \( y \) a non-negative integer. The possible values for \( x \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For each of these values, \( y \) will be a non-negative integer.

To find the specific value of \( y \), we can choose any of these values. However, the problem does not specify a particular value for \( x \), so we can choose the simplest case where \( x = 0 \):

\[ y = 6 - 0 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of containers delivered on the second day is \( y = 6 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,4
polymath-low-de-119,"Let's denote Lylah's initial salary as \( L \) and Adrian's initial salary as \( A \). According to the problem, Adrian's initial salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, so we can write:

\[ A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]

We are also given that Adrian's initial salary \( A \) is 40,000 US-Dollar. Therefore:

\[ A = 40,000 \]

Substituting \( A \) into the equation \( A = 1.3L \):

\[ 40,000 = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Now, four years later, Adrian's salary has increased by 40% compared to four years ago. So, Adrian's new salary is:

\[ A_{\text{new}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A = 1.4 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \]

Lylah's salary has also increased, but the problem does not specify the rate of her salary increase. Since the problem does not provide this information, we will assume her salary has increased by the same percentage as Adrian's (40%) for simplicity. So, Lylah's new salary is:

\[ L_{\text{new}} = L + 0.4L = 1.4L = 1.4 \times \frac{400,000}{13} = \frac{560,000}{13} \approx 43,076.92 \]

The total salary of both Adrian and Lylah four years later is:

\[ A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 56,000 + \frac{560,000}{13} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the total salary is:

\[ 99,077 \]

First, let's calculate the number of fruits Morisette brought:
- Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette brought is:
  \[
  5 + 8 = 13
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so Kael brought:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples}
  \]
- Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought:
  \[
  \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges}

Now, we sum the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael:
\[
13 + 14 = 27

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.

polymath-low-de-123,"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break the problem into two parts: the time she runs at 10 miles per hour and the time she runs at 5 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the time Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour:
   Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance at 10 miles per hour} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Determine the remaining time after the first 3 hours:
   The total time is 7 hours, and she has already run for 3 hours.
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = 7 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance at 5 miles per hour} = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. Add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles}

Thus, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50
polymath-low-de-124,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of unfranked letters:**
   Jennie has a total of 60 letters to frank.
   
2. **Calculate the number of letters that are franked:**
   Jennie frankes one-third of the 60 letters.
   \[
   \text{Number of franked letters} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Determine the number of letters that are already franked:**
   We are given that there are 30 letters already franked.

4. **Calculate the number of letters that Jennie has franked:**
   The number of letters franked by Jennie is the difference between the total number of franked letters and the number of letters already franked.
   \[
   \text{Letters franked by Jennie} = 20 - 30 = 10
   \]
   This indicates a mistake in the interpretation since the number of letters franked by Jennie cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

5. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   Since the number of letters franked by Jennie is 20 and there are 30 letters already franked, it means that all 20 letters franked by Jennie are already part of the 30 franked letters. This implies that the 30 franked letters include the 20 franked by Jennie plus the 10 already franked by someone else.

6. **Determine the initial number of letters in the franked pile:**
   Let \( x \) be the initial number of franked letters. Since 10 letters are franked by Jennie and they are already part of the 30 franked letters, the initial number of franked letters \( x \) must be:
   \[
   x = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]

7. **Determine the initial number of unfranked letters:**
   The total number of letters is 60, and the initial number of franked letters is 20. Therefore, the initial number of unfranked letters is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
