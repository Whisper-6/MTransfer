mgsm-bn-47,"To solve this problem, let's first determine the cost of the red ties.

Given that the blue ties cost $40 each and the total cost for blue ties is $200, we can calculate the number of blue ties bought as follows:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total cost for blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since the blue ties are bought in pairs, and the cost of each blue tie is $40, the cost of each red tie is double that of a blue tie:
\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Given that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we can verify the cost of each red tie:
\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

However, the problem states that the red ties cost $80 each. This discrepancy suggests a direct cost of $80 per red tie, which aligns with the given information.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} \]

Since the number of red ties is the same as the number of blue ties (5 pairs):
\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 5 \times 80 = 400 \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total expenditure:
\[ \text{Total expenditure} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties} = 200 + 400 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total expenditure is:

mgsm-bn-48,"To solve this, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for consistency.

1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

The original length of the stick was 48 inches, and it was cut into pieces each 6 inches long.

To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from a 48-inch stick, we divide 48 by 6:

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Therefore, the number of pieces is 8.

mgsm-bn-49,"To find the number of units that are occupied in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of floors in the building:**
   - The building is divided into 15 floors.

2. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - Each floor has 8 units.
   - Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

3. **Calculate the number of occupied floors:**
   - The building is occupied by 3/4 of its floors.
   - Occupied floors = 15 floors * 3/4 = 11.25 floors.
   - Since the number of floors must be a whole number, we consider 11 full floors (as partial floors are not practical).

4. **Calculate the total number of occupied units:**
   - Each occupied floor has 8 units.
   - Occupied units = 11 floors * 8 units/floor = 88 units.

Therefore, the number of units that are occupied is 88.

mgsm-bn-54,"Let's denote the number of Pichi's vulture chicks as P, and the number of Tricksy's vulture chicks as T. According to the problem, we know that:

1. The first vulture has three times as many vulture chicks as Pichi, so the number of vulture chicks from the first vulture is 3P.
2. Tricksy's vulture has 12 vulture chicks, so T = 12.

The total number of vulture chicks is the sum of the vulture chicks from all three vultures, which is given as 7. So we can write the equation:

\[3P + T = 7\]

Substituting T = 12 into the equation, we get:

\[3P + 12 = 7\]

Solving for P, we get:

\[3P = 7 - 12\]
\[3P = -5\]

Since P must be a non-negative integer, and -5 is not a valid number of vulture chicks, we need to reconsider the problem statement. The only logical conclusion is that the given numbers (3P + 12 = 7) imply that the only feasible solution is when P = 1 (since P must be a non-negative integer and the only way to satisfy the equation with integer values is if P = 1).

So, P = 1, and T = 12. The total number of vulture chicks is:

\[3 \times 1 + 12 = 3 + 12 = 15\]

However, the problem states the total is 7, which means the only possible solution under the given constraints is when P = 1 and T = 12, and the only way to satisfy the given total of 7 is if the vulture chicks are distributed in a way that fits the given numbers. Therefore, the total number of vulture chicks (vulture chicks from Pichi, Tricksy, and the unknown vulture) is 7.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, the total number of vulture chicks is:

Peter spends $7 on a movie ticket and $7 on popcorn each time he goes to the cinema. Therefore, each visit costs him $14.

Given that Peter has $42, we need to determine how many times he can go to the cinema with this amount.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Number of visits} = \frac{\text{Total money Peter has}}{\text{Cost per visit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of visits} = \frac{42}{14} \]
\[ \text{Number of visits} = 3 \]

mgsm-bn-57,"To solve this, let's denote the number of boxes as \(x\).

Given:
- Each box weighs 15 pounds.
- The total weight of the loaded truck and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
- The maximum weight the bridge can carry is 5000 pounds.

The weight of the loaded truck can be expressed as the weight of the empty truck plus the weight of the boxes:
\[ 15x \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the loaded truck and the empty truck is:
\[ 3755 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight of the empty truck is:
\[ 3755 - 15x \text{ pounds} \]

The weight of the loaded truck is:
\[ 15x \text{ pounds} \]

The weight of the loaded truck should be less than or equal to the maximum weight the bridge can carry:
\[ 15x \leq 5000 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x \leq \frac{5000}{15} \]
\[ x \leq 333.33 \]

Since \(x\) must be a whole number, the maximum number of boxes \(x\) can be is 333.

mgsm-bn-62,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the future value of the pension after 30 years of work, considering the initial annual pension and the annual increase in the pension amount.

1. **Initial Pension Calculation:**
   - Initial annual pension: $50,000
   - Number of years working: 20 years
   - Annual increase rate: 5%

2. **Pension after 20 years:**
   - The pension after 20 years will be compounded annually at a rate of 5%.
   - The formula for compound interest is: \( A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \)
   - Here, \( P = 50,000 \), \( r = 0.05 \), \( n = 1 \) (since it's compounded annually), and \( t = 20 \).
   - So, \( A = 50,000 \left(1 + 0.05\right)^{20} \)
   - \( A = 50,000 \left(1.05\right)^{20} \)
   - \( A = 50,000 \times 2.6533 \)
   - \( A = 132,665 \)

3. **Pension after 30 years:**
   - From year 21 to year 30, the pension increases by 5% annually.
   - The formula for the future value of a growing annuity is: \( FV = P \frac{(1 + r)^n - (1 + g)^n}{r - g} \)
   - Here, \( P = 132,665 \), \( r = 0.05 \), \( g = 0.05 \), and \( n = 10 \).
   - So, \( FV = 132,665 \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{10} - (1 + 0.05)^{0}}{0.05 - 0.05} \)
   - Since \( (1 + 0.05)^{10} - 1 = 1.62889 - 1 = 0.62889 \)
   - \( FV = 132,665 \times 0.62889 \)

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - Total days in a year = 365.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days = 365 - 180 = 185 days.
   - Cecil consumes 2 cups of dog food per day after the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days = 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

3. **Total dog food consumed in the first year:**
   - Total cups of dog food = 180 (first 180 days) + 370 (remaining 185 days) = 550 cups.

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags required = Total cups of dog food / Cups per bag = 550 / 110 = 5 bags.

Therefore, Cecil will need 5 bags of dog food over the first year.

Given:
1. Remand does half the laundry compared to Sarah: \( R = \frac{1}{2}S \).
2. David does 4 times the laundry compared to Sarah: \( D = 4S \).
3. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry: \( S = 400 \).

First, we calculate the amount of laundry done by Remand:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of laundry done by David:
\[ D = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the amount of laundry done by Remand and David:
\[ D - R = 1600 - 200 = 1400 \text{ pounds} \]

mgsm-bn-78,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of buying 18 flowers at the best possible price.

First, let's calculate the cost per flower for both options:

1. Buying 3 packages for $2.50:
   - Cost per package = $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (approximately)
   - Cost per flower = $0.8333 / 3 = $0.2778 (approximately)

2. Buying 2 flowers for $1:
   - Cost per flower = $1 / 2 = $0.50

The second option gives a lower cost per flower ($0.50) compared to the first option ($0.2778). Therefore, we should use the second option to minimize the cost.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at $0.50 per flower:
- Total cost = 18 * $0.50 = $9.00

Thus, the amount of money Vincent will save by buying 18 flowers at the best price is $\\boxed{9}$.",9,6

Given:
- Number of chocolate bars (chocolate bars) = 25
- Number of candied apples (candied apples) = 80
- Weight of each chocolate bar = 40 grams
- Weight of each candied apple = 2 * weight of each chocolate bar

First, calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = \text{Number of chocolate bars} \times \text{Weight of each chocolate bar} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams}

2. Each day, the brown turkeys give 5 turkeys.
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 turkeys each day.
4. The number of brown turkeys is 2 more than the number of red turkeys.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 3r + 5b = 42 \]
\[ b = r + 2 \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red turkeys. To verify, we can find the number of brown turkeys:
\[ b = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Check the total number of turkeys collected:

Given that each reservoir loses water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, the smaller reservoir would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons, and the larger reservoir would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Thus, the amounts of water in the reservoirs after 4 minutes would be:

- Smaller reservoir: \( x - 16 \)
- Larger reservoir: \( 2x - 16 \)

According to the problem, after 4 minutes, the larger reservoir has four times the amount of water in the smaller reservoir:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Let's solve this equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 2x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2x = -48 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

So, initially, the smaller reservoir had 24 gallons of water. After 4 minutes, the smaller reservoir has:

mgsm-bn-232,"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of peacocks as \( P \) and the number of peacocks as \( A \).

According to the problem, the number of peacocks seen by Dax is half the number of peacocks in the garden. We are given that there are 50 peacocks in the garden. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P = \frac{1}{2}A \]

Since \( P \) is the number of peacocks in the garden, we have:

\[ P = 50 \]

Substituting \( P = 50 \) into the equation \( P = \frac{1}{2}A \):

\[ 50 = \frac{1}{2}A \]

To find \( A \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ A = 100 \]

The total number of birds (peacocks and peahens) in the garden is the sum of the peacocks and peahens:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = P + A = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of birds in the garden is:

1. **Total number of penguins**: 36

2. **Penguins that jumped into the sea**: 
   - They jumped after 1/3 of the day, so 1/3 of 36 penguins jumped into the sea.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \)

3. **Penguins that slept in the cave**: 
   - The remaining penguins slept in the cave, which is 2/3 of the total.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \)

4. **Penguins that were still sunbathing**: 
   - The penguins that were still sunbathing are the ones that didn't jump into the sea and didn't go to the cave.
   - Calculation: \( 36 - 12 - 24 = 0 \)

Therefore, the number of penguins that were still sunbathing is 0.

First, let's determine the cost for the first glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.

For the subsequent glasses, there is a 60% discount on the second glass, meaning the second glass costs 40% of $5:
- 40% of $5 = 0.4 * $5 = $2.

For the third glass, there is a 60% discount on the third glass, which costs 40% of $5:
- 40% of $5 = $2.

This pattern continues for all subsequent glasses. Thus, for each glass after the first, the cost is $2.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The remaining 15 glasses each cost $2.

Total cost = Cost of the first glass + Cost of the remaining 15 glasses
Total cost = $5 + 15 * $2

First, let's calculate the annual profit:
- Each year, 7 garlic bulbs are produced.
- Each garlic bulb is sold for $1.5.
- The cost to produce the garlic bulbs is $3 per year.

Net profit per year = (Number of bulbs * Price per bulb) - Cost
Net profit per year = (7 * $1.5) - $3
Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3
Net profit per year = $7.5

Next, we need to find out how many years it will take for the total profit to cover the initial cost of $90.

Number of years = Initial cost / Net profit per year
Number of years = $90 / $7.5

mgsm-bn-18,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs (assuming ""ডিম"" means ""eggs"" in this context) Clare consumes over 4 weeks.

1. First, we determine the number of days in 4 weeks:
   \[
   4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Clare eats 3 eggs each day. Therefore, the total number of eggs she eats in 28 days is:
   \[
   28 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ eggs/day} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Since the question asks for the total in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen}

Thus, Clare will eat $\boxed{7}$ dozen eggs over 4 weeks.",4,7
mgsm-bn-19,"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total time Marias took to cover the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles.

- Time to cover the first 4 miles: 1 hour
- Time to cover the next 2 miles: 1 hour

Total time taken for 6 miles: 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Total distance to be covered: 12 miles

Required average speed: 4 miles per hour

To find the speed needed to cover the remaining 6 miles in 2 hours:

\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile journey, Marias needs to cover the remaining 6 miles at 3 miles per hour.

The speed needed to cover the remaining distance is 3 miles per hour.

mgsm-bn-20,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water left after the described process.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange juice:**
   - Orange juice: 10 liters total, 2/3 water.
   - Water in orange juice = \( 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple juice:**
   - Pineapple juice: 15 liters total, 5/8 water.
   - Water in pineapple juice = \( 15 \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{75}{8} \) liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before mixing:**
   - Total water = Water in orange juice + Water in pineapple juice
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{75}{8} \)
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator (24):
     - \( \frac{20}{3} = \frac{20 \times 8}{3 \times 8} = \frac{160}{24} \)
     - \( \frac{75}{8} = \frac{75 \times 3}{8 \times 3} = \frac{225}{24} \)
   - Total water = \( \frac{160}{24} + \frac{225}{24} = \frac{385}{24} \) liters.

4. **Subtract the water lost when one liter of orange juice is poured out:**
   - Water lost = 1 liter
   - Remaining water = \( \frac{385}{24} - 1 = \frac{385}{24} - \frac{24}{24} = \frac{361}{24} \) liters.

5. **Calculate the total volume of the mixture after mixing:**
   - Total volume = Volume of orange juice + Volume of pineapple juice
   - Total volume = 10 liters + 15 liters = 25 liters.

6. **Calculate the amount of water in the final mixture:**
   - Water in final mixture = Total water remaining
   - Water in final mixture = \( \frac{361}{24} \) liters.

7. **Calculate the percentage of water in the final mixture:**
   - Percentage of water = \( \frac{\frac{361}{24}}{25} \times 100 = \frac{361}{24 \times 25} \times 100 = \frac{361}{600} \times 100 \approx 60.17\% \).

8. **Calculate the amount of water in the final 24 liters:**
   - Water in 24 liters = \( 24 \times \frac{60.17}{100} \approx 24 \times 0.6017 = 14.44 \) liters.

Therefore, the amount of water left in the final 24 liters is approximately 14.44 liters.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken:
- Mary bought 12 chicken pieces for $12.
- Therefore, the cost per chicken piece is $12 / 12 = $1.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the milk:
- Mary bought 5 packs of milk for $3.
- Therefore, the cost per pack of milk is $3 / 5 = $0.60.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
- Mary bought 4 apples for $1.50.
- Therefore, the cost per apple is $1.50 / 4 = $0.375.

Now, let's denote the number of boxes of pizza Mary ordered as \( x \).
- The cost of one box of pizza is $8.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) boxes of pizza is \( 8.50x \).

The total amount Mary spent is the sum of the costs of the chicken, milk, and apples plus the cost of the pizza boxes:
\[ 12 + 3 + 4 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Let the age of Dale be \(7x\) and the age of Allen be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

- Distance run on the other two days = half the distance of the first day

First, let's calculate the distance run on the other two days:
- Distance on the first day = 3 hours
- Distance on the other two days = 0.5 * 3 hours = 1.5 hours each day

Total distance run in the week:

Dan can skip 3 miles in one hour when he is skipping. The problem states that when Dan skips, he can skip at half the speed of his running speed. This means his skipping speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \) miles per hour, but since he skips 3 miles in one hour, we can equate this to \( \frac{v}{2} = 3 \), giving us \( v = 6 \) miles per hour. Therefore, his walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time spent skipping and running. If Dan skips for one-third of the total time and runs for two-thirds of the total time, and the total time is 6 hours, then he skips for \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours and runs for \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

The distance covered while skipping is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles, and the distance covered while running is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) miles. Therefore, the total distance covered in 6 hours is \( 6 + 24 = 30 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of meat is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of 200 pounds of meat is \( 200 \times 10 = 2000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling 20 units of meatballs:**
   - Each unit is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the revenue from selling 20 units is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as revenue minus cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \( 40 - 2000 = -1960 \) dollars.

Since the profit is negative, it indicates a loss. The loss is $1960.

1. **Determine the number of blog posts written each day:**
   - Let the number of blog posts written on Sunday be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, on Monday, she wrote \( 5x \) posts.
   - On Monday, she wrote 2/5 more posts than on Sunday, so \( 5x = x + \frac{2}{5}x = \frac{7}{5}x \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 5 \).
   - Therefore, on Sunday, she wrote 5 posts.
   - On Monday, she wrote \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) posts.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) posts.
   - On Wednesday, she wrote \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) posts.

2. **Calculate the total number of blog posts written in the week:**
   - Total posts = \( 5 + 25 + 50 + 100 = 180 \).

3. **Calculate the total time spent writing:**
   - Time spent on each blog post = 4 hours.
   - Total time spent = \( 180 \times 4 = 720 \) hours.

Therefore, the total time spent writing is $\\boxed{720}$.",720,104
mgsm-bn-46,"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. She bought a packet of post-it notes.
3. After buying the packet, she added 220 more post-it notes to her collection.
4. After distributing the notes, she had 23 post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the packet as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes. After buying the packet and adding the 220 additional notes, the total number of post-it notes she had before distributing them was \( 80 + x + 220 = 300 + x \).

After distributing the notes, she had 23 left. This means the total number of post-it notes she had before distributing them was 23 more than the number she had left. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 300 + x = 23 + 23 \]
\[ 300 + x = 46 \]
\[ x = 46 - 300 \]
\[ x = -254 \]

This negative result indicates an error in the setup. Let's correct the setup:

The total number of post-it notes before distributing them should be the sum of the initial notes plus the notes in the packet, and this total minus the 23 notes left should equal the 220 notes added:

\[ 80 + x + 220 = 23 + 220 \]
\[ 300 + x = 243 \]
\[ x = 243 - 300 \]
\[ x = -57 \]

Again, this negative result indicates an error. Let's re-evaluate:

The correct setup should be:

\[ 80 + x + 220 = 23 + 23 \]
\[ 300 + x = 46 \]
\[ x = 46 - 300 \]
\[ x = -254 \]

This indicates an error in the problem statement or interpretation. Let's assume the problem meant she had 23 left after adding the 220, so:

\[ 80 + x + 220 = 23 + 220 \]
\[ 300 + x = 243 \]
\[ x = 243 - 300 \]
\[ x = -57 \]

Re-evaluating correctly:

\[ 80 + x + 220 = 23 + 220 \]
\[ 300 + x = 243 \]
\[ x = 243 - 300 \]
\[ x = -57 \]

The correct number of post-it notes in the packet is 220.

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the packet is 220.

The final answer is: $\\boxed{220}$",220,163
mgsm-bn-94,"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \) and the number of wolves as \( W \). According to the problem, the number of dogs is 60. We are also given that the number of wolves is twice the number of dogs, so \( W = 2D \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation for \( W \), we get:

\[ W = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

The problem states that the number of strays is 20 less than the number of dogs. Let's denote the number of strays as \( S \). Therefore, we have:

\[ S = D - 20 \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation for \( S \), we get:

\[ S = 60 - 20 = 40 \]

The total number of animals in the village is the sum of the dogs, wolves, and strays. So, we have:

Substituting \( H = 9 \) into the equation:
\[ J = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

1. When Freda cooks tomatoes with tomatoes, the amount of tomatoes is halved.
2. For every 16 ounces of ketchup, she uses 3 tomatoes.
3. She made 32 ounces of sauce this time.

First, let's find out how many tomatoes she would need for 32 ounces of sauce before considering the halving effect:

- Since 16 ounces of ketchup requires 3 tomatoes, then:
  - 32 ounces of ketchup would require \( 32 \div 16 \times 3 = 2 \times 3 = 6 \) tomatoes.

Now, considering that the amount of tomatoes is halved each time she cooks:

- Initially, she would need 6 tomatoes.
- After the first halving, she would need \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) tomatoes.
- After the second halving, she would need \( 3 \div 2 = 1.5 \) tomatoes.
- After the third halving, she would need \( 1.5 \div 2 = 0.75 \) tomatoes.

Since she actually used 32 ounces of sauce, which corresponds to the third halving, she used 0.75 tomatoes.

Therefore, the number of tomatoes Freda used is $\\boxed{0.75}$.",75,12

3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed through the toll booth.
4. 5 cars left the line to avoid passing through the toll booth.

Given that 5 cars left the line, we can infer that these 5 cars were among the x cars that passed in the first 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the toll booth in the first 30 minutes is x + 20.

Since 5 cars left the line, the number of cars that passed through the toll booth in the first 30 minutes is also equal to the initial number of cars minus the 5 cars that left the line:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Solving for x:

Henry realizes he baked 15 more cookies than last year, so:
\[ x = \frac{x}{2} + 15 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[ 2x = x + 30 \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ x = 30 \]

So, Henry baked 30 cookies this year.

Now, let's verify the information about the cookies he left out and the total number of cookies he has now. If 5 cookies fell out, and he now has 110 cookies, the number of cookies he had before leaving them out was:
\[ 110 + 5 = 115 \]

This means the total number of cookies he had before leaving any out was 115, which matches the sum of this year's and last year's cookies:
\[ 30 + \frac{30}{2} = 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Since he left out 5 cookies, the total number of cookies he had before leaving them out was indeed 45 + 5 = 115, which matches 110 + 5.

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year was:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

mgsm-bn-116,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much tea, coffee grounds, and milk were used given the ratio and the total amount used.

The ratio of tea to coffee grounds to milk to water is 7:13:1:5. This means for every 7 parts of tea, there are 13 parts of coffee grounds, 1 part of milk, and 5 parts of water.

The total number of parts in the ratio is:
\[ 7 + 13 + 1 + 5 = 26 \]

Given that the total amount of the mixture is 120 parts, we can find out how many parts each component represents by dividing the total parts by the total mixture parts:
\[ \frac{120}{26} = \frac{60}{13} \]

Now, we can calculate the amount of each component:
- Tea: \( 7 \times \frac{60}{13} = \frac{420}{13} \approx 32.31 \) parts
- Coffee grounds: \( 13 \times \frac{60}{13} = 60 \) parts
- Milk: \( 1 \times \frac{60}{13} = \frac{60}{13} \approx 4.62 \) parts
- Water: \( 5 \times \frac{60}{13} = \frac{300}{13} \approx 23.08 \) parts

Therefore, the amount of tea used is \(\boxed{32.31}\) parts.",31,42

mgsm-bn-118,"Let's denote the number of containers from the first day as \( x \).

From the problem, we know that each container contains 5 trucks. Therefore, the number of trucks from the first day is \( 2x \times 5 = 10x \).

On the second day, additional containers were brought, and the total number of trucks became 30. Let the number of additional containers brought on the second day be \( y \). Each of these containers also contains 5 trucks, so the number of trucks from the additional containers is \( y \times 5 = 5y \).

The total number of trucks after the second day is the sum of the trucks from the first day and the additional trucks from the second day:
\[ 10x + 5y = 30 \]

We need to find \( y \), the number of additional containers brought on the second day. To do this, we need to find integer values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation. Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, let's solve for \( y \):

\[ 5y = 30 - 10x \]
\[ y = \frac{30 - 10x}{5} \]
\[ y = 6 - 2x \]

For \( y \) to be a non-negative integer, \( 6 - 2x \geq 0 \):
\[ 6 \geq 2x \]
\[ 3 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 3 \]

We also need to ensure that \( y \) is a non-negative integer. Let's test integer values of \( x \) from 0 to 3:

1. If \( x = 0 \):
   \[ y = 6 - 2(0) = 6 \]

2. If \( x = 1 \):
   \[ y = 6 - 2(1) = 4 \]

3. If \( x = 2 \):
   \[ y = 6 - 2(2) = 2 \]

4. If \( x = 3 \):
   \[ y = 6 - 2(3) = 0 \]

All these values of \( y \) are non-negative integers. However, the problem asks for the number of additional containers brought on the second day, which can be any of these values. The smallest and most straightforward value is when \( x = 0 \), giving \( y = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of additional containers brought on the second day is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,4
mgsm-bn-119,"Let's denote the monthly salary of Layler as L. According to the problem, Adrin's monthly salary was 30% more than Layler's, so Adrin's salary was 1.30L.

We are also told that four years ago, Adrin's salary was 40% more than Layler's salary at that time. So, if Layler's salary four years ago was L', then Adrin's salary four years ago was 1.40L'. Since L' = L - 4L (because Layler's salary decreased by 4L over four years), we have:

Adrin's salary four years ago = 1.40(L - 4L) = 1.40(-3L) = -4.2L.

But since Adrin's salary four years ago was 1.30L, we can equate and solve for L:

1.30L = -4.2L + 40000

Solving for L:

1.30L + 4.2L = 40000
5.50L = 40000
L = 40000 / 5.50
L = 7272.7272...

Now, Adrin's salary four years ago was 1.30L = 1.30 * 7272.7272... = 9454.5555...

Since Adrin's salary increased by 30% over four years, his current salary is:

9454.5555... * 1.30 = 12290.9222...

Layler's salary four years ago was L - 4L = -3L = -3 * 7272.7272... = -21818.1818...

Since Layler's salary increased by 30% over four years, his current salary is:

-21818.1818... * 1.30 = -28363.6363...

Since the salaries are in negative values, it indicates a decrease in salary. However, the problem is asking for the total salary in positive terms, so we take the absolute values and sum them up:

Adrin's current salary + Layler's current salary = 12290.9222... + 28363.6363... = 40654.5585...

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the total salary is approximately 40655.

1. For the first 3 hours, the speed is 10 miles per hour.
2. For the next 4 hours (since the total journey is 7 hours), the speed is 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance covered in the first 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance covered in the next 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to get the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

mgsm-bn-124,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initially, there are 60 envelopes.
   - 1 envelope has already had a stamp applied.
   - Therefore, there are 59 envelopes left to apply stamps.

2. **Stamps Applied:**
   - Jeni has applied stamps to \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining envelopes.
   - Number of envelopes that have stamps applied: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 59 = \frac{59}{3} \approx 19.67\).
   - Since the number of envelopes must be an integer, and typically in such problems, we assume whole envelopes, we take 19 envelopes (assuming rounding down as it's the closest practical number).

3. **Remaining Envelopes:**
   - After applying stamps to 19 envelopes, the remaining number of envelopes is \(59 - 19 = 40\).

4. **Current Situation:**
   - Now, there are 30 envelopes left to apply stamps.
   - This means 30 envelopes have been applied stamps, and the remaining 10 envelopes are still to be applied.

5. **Initial Setup Revisited:**
   - Initially, there were 60 envelopes.
   - 1 envelope has already been applied.
   - Therefore, initially, there were \(60 - 1 = 59\) envelopes to be applied stamps.

6. **Envelopes Applied So Far:**
   - Jeni has applied stamps to 19 envelopes so far.
   - Therefore, the total number of envelopes that have been applied stamps is \(1 + 19 = 20\).

7. **Initial Number of Envelopes:**
   - The initial number of envelopes is 59.
   - Jeni has applied stamps to 20 envelopes.
   - Therefore, the initial number of envelopes that had not been applied stamps is \(59 - 20 = 39\).

Thus, when Jeni started, there were 39 envelopes.

The final answer is $\boxed{39}$.",39,10

2. Her husband bought 5 more packs of chopsticks.
3. Julia used 3 chopsticks to make the sushi.
4. After arranging the table, there were 12 chopsticks available.

To find out how many chopsticks were in the pack Julia bought, we need to account for all the chopsticks:

- Let's assume the pack Julia bought had x chopsticks.
- Her husband's 5 packs would have 5x chopsticks.
- Julia used 3 chopsticks, so we subtract those from the total.
- After all transactions, there were 12 chopsticks left.

So the equation becomes:
\[ x + 5x - 3 = 12 \]
\[ 6x - 3 = 12 \]
\[ 6x = 15 \]
\[ x = 2.5 \]

Since the number of chopsticks must be a whole number, and considering the context of buying packs, it's reasonable to conclude that Julia bought a pack of 5 chopsticks.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- The hospital sees 500 patients.
- Each patient visit takes 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the number of patients seen per hour is \( \frac{60}{24} = 2.5 \) patients per hour.
- Therefore, the total number of patient visits per hour is \( 500 \times \frac{1}{2.5} = 200 \) patients per hour.
- The hospital charges $150 per patient visit.
- So, the total revenue is \( 200 \times 150 = 30000 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
- The cost for each patient visit is $200.
- The total number of patient visits is 200.
- So, the total cost is \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) dollars.
- Additionally, the doctors' cost is $150 per hour.
- The total number of hours worked is \( \frac{500}{2.5} = 200 \) hours.
- So, the total cost for doctors is \( 200 \times 150 = 30000 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 40000 + 30000 = 70000 \) dollars.

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 700 + 1400 + 2y = 700 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 2100 + 2y = 700 \]
\[ 2y = 700 - 2100 \]
\[ 2y = -1400 \]

Since the equation does not make sense in this context (we cannot have a negative number of butterflies), let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation:

The number of worker butterflies is \( 2 \times \) (number of caterpillars). Let's denote the number of caterpillars as \( z \):
\[ \text{Number of worker butterflies} = 2z \]

The total number of moths is:
\[ 700 + 2z = 700 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2z = 0 \]
\[ z = 0 \]

So, the number of worker butterflies is:
\[ 2 \times 0 = 0 \]

Thus, the number of kormi butterflies is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

The total number of kormi butterflies is:
\[ 1400 \]

Therefore, the number of kormi butterflies is \(\boxed{1400}\).",1400,400

1. **Calculate the total time Jordan spends gaming per day:**
   - Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day.

2. **Calculate the total time Jordan spends on part-time job per day:**
   - Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job.
   - Therefore, he earns $10 * 2 = $20 per day from his part-time job.

3. **Calculate the total time Jordan spends on gaming and part-time job per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total gaming time per week = 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.
   - Total part-time job earnings per week = $20/day * 7 days/week = $140/week.

4. **Calculate the total time Jordan would spend on work if he stopped gaming:**
   - If Jordan stopped gaming, he would spend all 14 hours per week on his part-time job.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on work (which is equivalent to the total gaming time) per week = 14 hours/week.

5. **Calculate the total earnings from work per week:**
   - Since he earns $10 per hour and works 14 hours per week, his weekly earnings from work = $10/hour * 14 hours/week = $140/week.

Therefore, if Jordan stops gaming and spends all his time on his part-time job, he can earn $140 per week.

The final answer is $\\boxed{140}$.",140,140

- Milk: 2 dollars
- Butter: 3 dollars
- Light bulb: 3 dollars
- Cup: 3 dollars
- Towel: 4 dollars

We can see that the towel is not a food item. Now, we calculate the total cost of all items and then apply a 10% discount to the cost of the towel.

1. Calculate the total cost of all items:
   \[
   2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 \text{ dollars}

First, let's calculate the weekly expenses:
- Lucas has 3 existing customers and 5 potential customers, making a total of 8 customers.
- Each customer requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 packet of dustpan.
- The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of dustpan is $5 per packet.

Weekly expenses calculation:
- Total bleach bottles: 8 customers * 2 bottles/customer = 16 bottles
- Total dustpan packets: 8 customers * 1 packet/customer = 8 packets
- Total cost for bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
- Total cost for dustpan: 8 packets * $5/packet = $40
- Total weekly expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Next, let's calculate the weekly income:
- Lucas expects to earn $92 per week.

Now, let's calculate the weekly profit:
- Weekly profit = Weekly income - Weekly expenses
- Weekly profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Lucas will make $20 in profit each week.

mgsm-bn-164,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the potential loss if Jack freelances:**
   - Jack can freelance for 3 hours.
   - He earns $35 per hour.
   - Therefore, the total potential loss if he freelances is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
     \]

2. **Calculate the potential gain if Jack hires a bookkeeper:**
   - The bookkeeper earns $90.
   - Therefore, the gain if Jack hires the bookkeeper is:
     \[
     \$90
     \]

3. **Calculate the net gain if Jack hires the bookkeeper:**
   - The net gain is the gain minus the potential loss:
     \[
     \$90 - \$105 = -\$15
     \]

4. **Determine the additional amount Jack would have if he hires the bookkeeper:**
   - Since the net gain is negative, Jack would actually lose $15 if he hires the bookkeeper.
   - Therefore, the additional amount Jack would have if he hires the bookkeeper is:
     \[
     \$0 - (-\$15) = \$15

Given:
- The cost of a cap (hat) is $25.
- The cost of a jacket is three times the cost of the cap.
- The average cost of the cap and the jacket is equal to the cost of the pants.

Let's calculate the cost of the jacket:
- Cost of jacket = 3 * Cost of cap = 3 * $25 = $75.

Let the cost of the pants be \( P \). According to the problem, the average cost of the cap and the jacket is equal to the cost of the pants:
- Average cost of cap and jacket = \(\frac{\text{Cost of cap} + \text{Cost of jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\).
- Therefore, \( P = 50 \).

Now, we can find the total cost of each uniform by adding the cost of the cap, the jacket, and the pants:

   - He is choosing two adjacent pairs of digits from this number.
   - We need to find how many more times it is likely that the resulting number is greater than 300 compared to it being 300 or less.

2. **Identify the Range of Numbers:**
   - A six-digit number ranges from 100000 to 999999.
   - Jerry is choosing two adjacent pairs of digits, which means we are essentially looking at numbers of the form ABCDEF, where A, B, C, D, E, and F are digits.

3. **Determine the Possible Outcomes:**
   - When Jerry chooses two adjacent pairs, he can form a new number by combining these pairs in different orders.
   - For example, if the original number is ABCDEF, he can form numbers like ABCEFD, BCFED, etc.

4. **Counting Favorable Outcomes:**
   - We need to count how many of these new numbers are greater than 300 and how many are 300 or less.
   - A number is greater than 300 if its first two digits are 30 or more.
   - A number is 300 or less if its first two digits are 30 or less.

5. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Since Jerry is choosing two adjacent pairs, each pair can independently be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - There are 10 possible digits for each pair.
   - The total number of possible outcomes is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

6. **Counting Favorable Outcomes for Each Case:**
   - **First two digits are 30 or more:** The possible pairs are 30, 31, 32, ..., 99 (60 possible pairs).
   - **First two digits are 30 or less:** The possible pairs are 00, 01, 02, ..., 29 (30 possible pairs).

7. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability of the new number being greater than 300 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
   - Probability = \(\frac{60}{100} = 0.6\).

8. **Probability of the New Number Being 300 or Less:**
   - The probability of the new number being 300 or less is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
   - Probability = \(\frac{30}{100} = 0.3\).

9. **Difference in Probabilities:**
   - The difference in probabilities is \(0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3\).

10. **Expressing the Difference as a Percentage:**
    - To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100.
    - Difference = \(0.3 \times 100 = 30\%\).

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins is 70. Enclosing the final number, we get:

2. R / 2 = A - 5 (Remond has half as many jewels as Aron, and Aron has 5 more jewels than Remond)
3. R = 40 (Remond has 40 jewels)

Using the third piece of information, we know R = 40. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = A - 5 \]
\[ 20 = A - 5 \]
\[ A = 25 \]

Now, using the first piece of information, we can find S:

polymath-low-bn-38,"To find out how fast Jan runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in the three days and divide it by the total time he spends running.

Given:
- Total distance in a week = 60 miles
- Number of days he runs in a week = 3
- Distance run on the first day = 3 hours
- Distance run on the other two days = half the distance of the first day

First, let's calculate the distance run on the first day:
- Distance on the first day = 3 hours

Next, calculate the distance run on the other two days:
- Distance on the second and third days = \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) miles each day

Now, add up the total distance run in the three days:
- Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day + Distance on the third day
- Total distance = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 miles

The total time spent running in the three days is:
- Total time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
- Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Let \( v_h \) be the speed of Dan while walking, and \( v_r \) be the speed of Dan while running. According to the problem:
\[ v_r = 4v_h \]
\[ \text{Dan can skip at } \frac{v_r}{2} = 2v_h \]

Dan can skip 3 miles per hour. So, \( v_s = 3 \) miles per hour.

Dan can skip at 2/3 of his running speed, so:
\[ 2v_h = 3 \]
\[ v_h = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ v_r = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Dan skips at 3 miles per hour.

Now, let's denote the time spent skipping as \( t_s \) and the time spent walking as \( t_w \). The total time spent is 6 hours:
\[ t_s + t_w = 6 \]

The distance covered while skipping is:
\[ 3t_s \]

The distance covered while walking is:
\[ 1.5t_w \]

The total distance covered is:
\[ 3t_s + 1.5t_w = D \]

We also know that the time spent skipping is 1/3 of the total time, and the time spent walking is 2/3 of the total time:
\[ t_s = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ t_w = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the total distance:
\[ D = 3t_s + 1.5t_w = 3 \times 2 + 1.5 \times 4 = 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the javelin can be thrown when the blue sapphire is not held.

Given that the blue sapphire's presence triples the throwing distance, we can infer that the absence of the blue sapphire would reduce the throwing distance to one-third of the initial distance.

Therefore, the distance when the blue sapphire is not held is:

- On Wednesday, she wrote \( 2 \times \frac{6}{5}x = \frac{12}{5}x \) posts (twice as many as Monday).

Now, we calculate the total number of posts written over the three days:
\[ x + \frac{6}{5}x + \frac{12}{5}x = x + \frac{6x + 12x}{5} = x + \frac{18x}{5} = \frac{5x + 18x}{5} = \frac{23x}{5} \]

Since it takes 4 hours to write one post, the total time spent writing posts is:

Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the packet as \( x \).

The total number of post-it notes after buying the packet and distributing them is:
\[ 80 + x + 220 = 300 + x \]

According to the problem, after distributing the notes and putting 23 left, we can write the equation:
\[ 300 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 80 + x = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 - 80 \]
\[ x = -57 \]

Since the negative value indicates an error in interpretation or calculation, let's re-evaluate the distribution:

The correct equation should be:
\[ 300 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ 80 + x = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 - 80 \]
\[ x = -57 \]

Revisiting the problem, we realize the correct interpretation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ 80 + x = 23 + 220 \]
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]

- Total per visit: $7 + $7 = $14

Given that Peter has $42, we can find out how many visits he can make by dividing $42 by $14:

polymath-low-bn-57,"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of boxes as \( x \).

Given:
- Each box weighs 15 pounds.
- The total weight of the loaded truck and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
- The total weight of the loaded truck is 5000 pounds or more, but we need to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the truck's capacity.

First, let's determine the weight of the empty truck. If the loaded truck weighs 3755 pounds and the loaded truck with all boxes weighs 5000 pounds or more, we can find the weight of the empty truck by subtracting the weight of the loaded truck from 5000 pounds:

\[ \text{Weight of the empty truck} = 5000 - x \times 15 \]

Given that the total weight of the loaded truck is 3755 pounds, we can set up the equation for the total weight of the loaded truck:

\[ 3755 = \text{Weight of the empty truck} + x \times 15 \]

Substitute the expression for the weight of the empty truck:

\[ 3755 = (5000 - x \times 15) + x \times 15 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3755 = 5000 - x \times 15 + x \times 15 \]
\[ 3755 = 5000 - x \times 15 + x \times 15 \]
\[ 3755 = 5000 - x \times 15 + x \times 15 \]
\[ 3755 = 5000 - x \times 15 + x \times 15 \]
\[ 3755 = 5000 - x \times 15 + x \times 15 \]
\[ 3755 = 5000 - x \times 15 + x \times 15 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 3755 = 5000 - x \times 15 \]
\[ 3755 - 5000 = - x \times 15 \]
\[ -1245 = - x \times 15 \]
\[ x = \frac{1245}{15} \]
\[ x = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the truck's capacity is 83.

polymath-low-bn-59,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the components of the problem:**
   - There are 6 ripe strawberries.
   - Each ripe strawberry has 20 seeds.
   - There are 67 separate seeds in the strawberry cluster.
   - We need to find the total number of strawberries.

2. **Calculate the total number of seeds if all strawberries had 20 seeds each:**
   \[
   \text{Total seeds if each strawberry had 20 seeds} = 6 \times 20 = 120
   \]

3. **Determine how many additional seeds are present:**
   \[
   \text{Additional seeds} = 67 - 120 = -53
   \]
   Since the result is negative, it indicates that the problem's setup might be misleading. Instead, we should consider the seeds as a mix of the 67 seeds and the seeds from the strawberries. 

4. **Reframe the problem:**
   - The total number of seeds (including the 67 separate seeds) is 120 (if each strawberry had 20 seeds).
   - We need to find out how many strawberries are needed to produce 120 seeds.

5. **Calculate the number of strawberries:**
   \[
   \text{Number of strawberries} = \frac{120 \text{ seeds}}{20 \text{ seeds/strawberry}} = 6
   \]

6. **Verify the total number of seeds:**
   - 6 strawberries, each with 20 seeds, equals 120 seeds.
   - Adding the 67 separate seeds, the total number of seeds is 187.

Since the problem states there are 67 separate seeds, and each strawberry has 20 seeds, the number of strawberries must be recalculated to fit the total number of seeds correctly.

7. **Correct calculation:**
   - If each strawberry has 20 seeds, and the total number of seeds is 187, we can find the number of strawberries:
   \[
   \text{Number of strawberries} = \frac{187 \text{ seeds}}{20 \text{ seeds/strawberry}} = 9.35
   \]
   Since the number of strawberries must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 10.

Therefore, the total number of strawberries is 10.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - For the first 20 years, the pension increases at a rate of 5% per year.
   - The formula for the future value of an annuity with compound interest is \(FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}\), where \(P\) is the annual payment, \(r\) is the interest rate, and \(n\) is the number of periods.
   - Here, \(P = 50,000\), \(r = 0.05\), and \(n = 20\).
   - The future value after 20 years is \(50,000 \times \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{20} - 1}{0.05} = 50,000 \times \frac{(1.05)^{20} - 1}{0.05} = 50,000 \times 34.785 = 1,739,250\).

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - For the next 10 years, the pension increases at a rate of 5% per year, but the pension itself is the future value calculated in the first part, which is $1,739,250.
   - The future value of this amount after 10 more years is \(1,739,250 \times (1.05)^{10} = 1,739,250 \times 1.6289 = 2,823,682.65\).

First, calculate the number of players from each school:
- Each school sends 1 team of 5 players (for girls) + 1 team of 5 players (for boys) = 10 players per school.

Next, calculate the number of players from all schools:

- The top floor (4th floor) has an area of 16 square feet.
- Each floor's area is half the area of the floor below it.

Let's denote the areas of the floors from top to bottom as \(A_4, A_3, A_2,\) and \(A_1\).

From the problem, we know:
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]

Since each floor's area is half the area of the floor below it, we can express the areas of the other floors in terms of \(A_4\):
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_4 \]
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 4 \times A_4 \]
\[ A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 8 \times A_4 \]

Substituting \(A_4 = 16\):
\[ A_3 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_1 = 8 \times 16 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we calculate the average area of the four floors:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{A_4 + A_3 + A_2 + A_1}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{16 + 32 + 64 + 128}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{240}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average area} = 60 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average (mean) area of one floor is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60
polymath-low-bn-76,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food consumed by Sienna's new puppy over the first year and then determine how many bags of dog food this amount represents.

First, let's break down the consumption:

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy is given 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - There are 180 days in the first 6 months.
   - Total cups of dog food for the first 180 days: \( 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining 180 days:**
   - The puppy is given 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - There are 180 days in the second 6 months.
   - Total cups of dog food for the remaining 180 days: \( 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 360 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total consumption in the first year:**
   - Total cups of dog food over the first year: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups} \).

Now, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required:

- Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- Number of bags needed: \( \frac{540 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 4.909 \).

Since Sienna can't purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Sienna will need \( \boxed{5} \) bags of dog food for the first year.",5,5

2. David does 4 times what Sarah does, so \( D = 4S \).

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so \( S = 400 \).

Using this information:
- \( R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \) pounds
- \( D = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) pounds

Now, to find the difference between what David and Remand do:

Let's denote the number of French fries that Jinjar gave to the Griffin as J. It is given that J = K / 2. Substituting K = 5, we get J = 5 / 2 = 2.5. Since the number of fries must be an integer, we assume Jinjar gave 2 fries (as typically partial fries are not considered in such problems).

Let's denote the number of French fries that Kelli took from the griffin as L. It is given that L = J - 3. Substituting J = 2, we get L = 2 - 3 = -1. This negative value indicates an error in interpretation, so we assume L = 0 (since you can't take negative fries).

Now, the total number of fries taken by Kell, Bill, and Kelli is K + B + L = 5 + 10 + 0 = 15.

1. **First 2 hours at 60 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Next 0.5 hours at 30 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Last 1.5 hours at 80 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[
\text{Total Distance Traveled} = 120 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
\]

Since the person started 3 hours into a 4-hour trip, we need to subtract the distance covered in those 3 hours from the total distance to find out how far they are from home:

1. **Calculate the annual income from garlic:**
   - Each year, Carlos gets 7 garlic bulbs.
   - Each garlic bulb is sold for $1.5.
   - Therefore, the annual income from garlic is \( 7 \times 1.5 = $10.5 \).

2. **Calculate the annual cost:**
   - The cost to plant the garlic is $90.

polymath-low-bn-13,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of back-up air purifiers (Back-up Vacuum Cleaners) Melani had initially:**
   - She sold one-third of her back-up air purifiers.
   - She sold two red houses.
   - She sold half of her remaining back-up air purifiers.

2. **Let \( x \) be the total number of back-up air purifiers Melani had initially.**

3. **Express the number of back-up air purifiers sold in terms of \( x \):**
   - She sold \(\frac{x}{3}\) back-up air purifiers.
   - She sold 2 red houses.
   - She sold \(\frac{x}{2}\) back-up air purifiers.

4. **Set up the equation to find the total number of back-up air purifiers:**
   - The sum of the back-up air purifiers sold is equal to the total number of back-up air purifiers minus the remaining ones.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{x}{3} + 2 + \frac{x}{2} = x\).

5. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine the fractions: \(\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{2x + 3x}{6} = \frac{5x}{6}\).
   - So, \(\frac{5x}{6} + 2 = x\).
   - Subtract \(\frac{5x}{6}\) from both sides: \(2 = x - \frac{5x}{6}\).
   - Simplify the right side: \(2 = \frac{6x - 5x}{6} = \frac{x}{6}\).
   - Multiply both sides by 6: \(12 = x\).

6. **Determine the number of back-up air purifiers Melani initially had:**
   - \( x = 12 \).

7. **Calculate the number of back-up air purifiers Melani sold:**
   - Sold \(\frac{12}{3} = 4\) back-up air purifiers.
   - Sold 2 red houses.
   - Sold \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) back-up air purifiers.
   - Total sold: \(4 + 2 + 6 = 12\).

Given:
- Total students = 20
- Percentage doing contemporary dance = 20%
- Percentage doing jazz dance = 25%

First, let's calculate the number of students doing contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of students doing jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{25}{100} \times 20 = 5 \text{ students} \]

Now, let's find the total number of students doing either contemporary or jazz dance:

Let the ages of Dale and Allen be \(7x\) and \(11x\) respectively, according to the given ratio 7:11.

The total age of Dale and Allen is given as 162 years:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]
\[ 18x = 162 \]
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find the current ages of Dale and Allen:

1. The first friend estimated 80 jellies.
2. The second friend's estimate was 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. So, the second friend's estimate is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \).
3. The third friend's estimate was 25% more than the first friend's estimate. So, the third friend's estimate is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \).

Now, we calculate the average of these three estimates:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

Given:
- There are 20 adults.
- There are 5 children.
- The total potato salad needed is the sum of the potato salad needed by all adults and all children.

The total potato salad needed by the adults is \( 20A \) pounds.
The total potato salad needed by the children is \( 5 \times \frac{A}{2} = \frac{5A}{2} \) pounds.

So, the total amount of potato salad needed is:
\[ 20A + \frac{5A}{2} = \frac{40A}{2} + \frac{5A}{2} = \frac{45A}{2} \]

Since we need to find the amount of potato salad each person gets, we divide the total by the total number of people (20 adults + 5 children = 25 people):
\[ \frac{\frac{45A}{2}}{25} = \frac{45A}{50} = \frac{9A}{10} \]

This means each person will get \( \frac{9A}{10} \) pounds of potato salad. Since \( A = 10 \) pounds (as per the problem statement for an adult), each person will get:
\[ \frac{9 \times 10}{10} = 9 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, to ensure that each person gets 9 pounds of potato salad, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

   - Let the number of poisons with Jan be \( J \).
   - Therefore, Marsia has \( 3J \) poisons.

2. **Determine the number of poisons with Cindy:**
   - According to the problem, Cindy has two more poisons than Marsia.
   - Therefore, Cindy has \( 3J + 2 \) poisons.

3. **Given the number of poisons with Cindy:**
   - The problem states that Cindy has 4 poisons.
   - Hence, \( 3J + 2 = 4 \).

4. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - \( 3J + 2 = 4 \)
   - Subtract 2 from both sides: \( 3J = 2 \)
   - Divide by 3: \( J = \frac{2}{3} \).

Since \( J = \frac{2}{3} \) is not a whole number, and the problem context suggests whole poisons, it seems there may be an inconsistency. However, assuming the problem intends whole numbers, let's proceed with the given values.

5. **Calculate the number of poisons with Jan:**
   - \( J = \frac{2}{3} \) (assuming the problem intends this value).

6. **Calculate the number of poisons with Marsia:**
   - \( 3J = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \).

7. **Calculate the number of poisons with Cindy:**
   - Given \( 4 \) poisons.

8. **Sum the total number of poisons:**
   - Jan: \( \frac{2}{3} \) (assuming the problem context allows fractional values)

   - Total: \( \frac{2}{3} + 2 + 4 = \frac{2}{3} + 6 = \frac{2 + 18}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \).

Since the problem context suggests whole numbers, let's assume the problem intended whole numbers. Given the fractional result, the problem might need re-evaluation. Assuming the problem intends whole numbers, let's consider the closest whole number scenario.

Therefore, the closest whole number sum is:
- Jan: 1 (assuming the fractional part is not considered)

We know that Gerald initially took \( t \) seconds to run 400 meters, so:
\[ v \cdot t = 400 \]
\[ t = \frac{400}{v} \]

We are also given that Gerald's new speed allows him to run 400 meters in \( t - 2 \) seconds, where \( t \) is the time it took him before the diet change. So:
\[ 1.1v \cdot (t - 2) = 400 \]
\[ 1.1v \cdot \left(\frac{400}{v} - 2\right) = 400 \]
\[ 1.1 \cdot (400 - 2v) = 400 \]
\[ 440 - 2.2v = 400 \]
\[ 440 - 400 = 2.2v \]
\[ 40 = 2.2v \]
\[ v = \frac{40}{2.2} = \frac{400}{22} = \frac{200}{11} \]

Now we can find \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{400}{v} = \frac{400}{\frac{200}{11}} = 22 \text{ seconds} \]

After changing his diet, Gerald's new time to run 400 meters is:

Given that 16 ounces of ketchup uses 3 tomatoes, we can find out how many tomatoes are used for 32 ounces of sauce.

Since 32 ounces is double 16 ounces, the number of tomatoes used for 32 ounces of sauce would be double the number of tomatoes used for 16 ounces of sauce.

For 16 ounces of sauce, the number of tomatoes is 3. Therefore, for 32 ounces of sauce, the number of tomatoes would be \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

Let's denote the number of cars that passed in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

After the first 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining on the motorway would be \( 30 - x \).

In the next 15 minutes, 20 cars passed the toll booth, and 5 cars left the line. So, the number of cars that actually passed the toll booth in the second 15 minutes is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

After the second 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining on the motorway would be \( (30 - x) - 15 = 15 - x \).

Since the problem states that the cars were eventually able to pass without congestion, it implies that the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the second 15 minutes should be zero or less than zero (meaning all cars have passed). Therefore, we have:

This means the remaining pieces are:
\[ x - \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{3}{4}x \]

Next, Papi's mother keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pieces:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{3}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{4}x \]

This leaves:
\[ \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{2}{4}x = \frac{1}{2}x \]

So, the number of pieces left is \( \frac{1}{2}x \).

We know that the number of pieces left is 1000:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x = 1000 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 1000 \times 2 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces is 2000. The number of pieces left is 1000.

According to the problem, Amir has three times more cookies than Cody. This can be written as:
\[ A = 3C + C \]
\[ A = 4C \]

If Amir has 5 cookies, then:
\[ A = 5 \]

Substituting \( A = 5 \) into the equation \( A = 4C \):
\[ 5 = 4C \]

polymath-low-bn-106,"To find the volume of each box, we first calculate the internal dimensions of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the internal dimensions are reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the internal dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
- Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
- Height: 4 - 2 = 2 inches

The volume of one box is then:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total internal volume of the 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total internal volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total internal volume of the 3 boxes is $\\boxed{72}$.",72,72
polymath-low-bn-107,"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time Frank watched TV each day and then determine how many 30-minute segments he watched on Wednesday.

- Sunday and Monday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes + 1 hour = 1.5 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Saturday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time Frank watched TV in a week = 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Since Frank watches TV for 7 hours in total, we need to find out how many 30-minute segments fit into 7 hours.

7 hours = 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes

Number of 30-minute segments in 420 minutes = 420 / 30 = 14 segments

Therefore, Frank watched 14 30-minute segments on Wednesday.

polymath-low-bn-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked this year as \( x \). According to the problem, he baked twice as many cookies as last year, so last year he baked \( \frac{x}{2} \) cookies.

Henry realizes he baked 15 more cookies than last year, so:
\[ x = \frac{x}{2} + 15 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[ 2x = x + 30 \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ x = 30 \]

So, Henry baked 30 cookies this year.

Now, let's verify the given conditions:
- Last year, he baked \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) cookies.
- This year, he baked 30 cookies, which is indeed twice as many.
- He baked 15 more cookies this year than last year, which is correct.
- After baking, 5 cookies fell and were not counted, so the remaining number of cookies is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

However, the problem states that after baking and cooling, there are 110 cookies in total. This discrepancy suggests there might be an additional condition or misunderstanding in the problem statement, but based on the given conditions and the logical steps, the number of cookies baked this year is:

First, let's break down the information given:
- The boat travels 160 feet in 17 seconds.
- The boat travels 64 feet in 64 seconds.

From this, we can calculate the speed of the boat:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{160 \text{ feet}}{17 \text{ seconds}} \approx 9.41 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to determine how far the boat traveled in the 64 seconds it took Julia to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Distance traveled} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9.41 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} \approx 602.24 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat traveled approximately 602.24 feet to reach the shore. During this time, the boat was continuously taking in water at a rate of 2 liters every 10 feet.

To find the total amount of water that entered the boat:
\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Distance per liter}} \times \text{Rate of water intake} \]
\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{602.24 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/liter}} \times 2 \text{ liters} \]
\[ \text{Total water} = 60.224 \times 2 \]

From the problem, we know:
1. \( J = 6B + 6 \)
2. \( B = 50G + 50 \)
3. \( J = 1800 \)

First, substitute \( J = 1800 \) into the first equation to find \( B \):
\[ 1800 = 6B + 6 \]
\[ 1794 = 6B \]
\[ B = 299 \]

Next, substitute \( B = 299 \) into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ 299 = 50G + 50 \]
\[ 249 = 50G \]
\[ G = 4.98 \]

Since the number of birds must be a whole number, and given the context of the problem, we can assume \( G = 5 \) (as 4.98 is close to 5 and the problem likely assumes whole numbers).

Now, we need to find the number of birds in the photo of the goose at Jamal's place, which is \( G = 5 \).

polymath-low-bn-115,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the boards that Sam sold and the total revenue from selling them, then find the profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 2x4x10 boards:
- Each 2x4x10 board costs $10.
- Sam has 10 such boards.
- Total cost for these boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the 4x4x10 boards:
- Each 4x4x10 board costs $16.
- Sam has 5 such boards.
- Total cost for these boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Total cost of all boards sold = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the 2x4x10 boards:
- Each 2x4x10 board was originally priced at $20 (since the price increased by 50%, the new price is 2 * $10).
- Sam sold all 10 boards at the new price.
- Revenue from 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $20/board = $200.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the 4x4x10 boards:
- Each 4x4x10 board was originally priced at $32 (since the price increased by 50%, the new price is 2 * $16).
- Sam sold all 5 boards at the new price.
- Revenue from 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $32/board = $160.

Total revenue from selling all boards = $200 + $160 = $360.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Total revenue = $360.
- Total cost = $180.
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $360 - $180 = $180.

Therefore, the profit is $\boxed{180}$.",180,90

We are also given that four years ago, Adrien's salary was 40% more than Layla's salary, and we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. So:
\[ 1.4L = 40000 \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.4} = \frac{400000}{14} = \frac{200000}{7} \approx 28571.43 \]

Now, let's find Adrien's initial salary:
\[ A = 1.3L = 1.3 \times \frac{200000}{7} = \frac{260000}{7} \approx 37142.86 \]

After four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = 1.4A = 1.4 \times \frac{260000}{7} = 2 \times 37142.86 = 74285.71 \]

Layla's salary also increased by 40%, so her new salary is:
\[ L_{\text{new}} = 1.4L = 1.4 \times \frac{200000}{7} = 2 \times 28571.43 = 57142.86 \]

The total salary of Adrien and Layla after four years is:
\[ A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 74285.71 + 57142.86 = 131428.57 \]

4. After stamping, there are 30 letters left to be stamped.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many letters Jeni has stamped so far:
- She has already stamped 1 letter.
- She has stamped \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining letters.

Let \( y \) be the number of letters she has already stamped. Then:
\[ y = 1 + \frac{1}{3}(x - 1) \]

After stamping \( y \) letters, the number of letters left to be stamped is:
\[ x - y = 30 \]

Substitute \( y \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ x - \left(1 + \frac{1}{3}(x - 1)\right) = 30 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x - 1 - \frac{1}{3}(x - 1) = 30 \]
\[ x - 1 - \frac{x}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 30 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 1 + \frac{1}{3} = 30 \]
\[ \frac{3x - x}{3} - \frac{3}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 30 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = 30 \]
\[ \frac{2x - 2}{3} = 30 \]
