1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $40 on each blue tie.
   - He spent a total of $200 on blue ties.
   - Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
     \[
     \frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - Each red tie costs $200 more than each blue tie.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Therefore, each red tie costs:
     \[
     40 + 200 = 240 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**
   - John bought 10 red ties.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the red ties is:
     \[
     10 \times 240 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of all the ties:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the red ties.
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     200 + 2400 = 2600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on the ties is \boxed{2600}.",2600,800
mgsm-ja-48,"To solve this problem, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide by the length of each cut piece to find out how many pieces she has.

1 foot = 12 inches, so a 4-foot wire is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long, so the number of pieces she gets is:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of wire she has is $\\boxed{8}$.",8,8

mgsm-ja-54,"Let's denote the number of kittens the first cat, Patches, gave birth to as \(3x\), and the number of kittens the second cat, Trixie, gave birth to as \(12\). The total number of kittens from Patches and Trixie is \(3x + 12\).

According to the problem, the total number of kittens they have now includes the 7 kittens they already had plus the 3 times the number of kittens Patches gave birth to plus the 12 kittens Trixie gave birth to. This can be expressed as:

\[7 + 3x + 12\]

We know from the problem that this total is equal to the number of kittens they have now, which is the sum of the 7 kittens they already had and the 3 times the number of kittens Patches gave birth to plus the 12 kittens Trixie gave birth to. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[7 + 3x + 12 = 7 + 3x + 12\]

This equation is already balanced, confirming our setup. Now, we need to find the value of \(x\). Since the number of kittens Patches gave birth to is \(3x\), and we know the total number of kittens they have now is the sum of the 7 kittens they already had plus the 3 times the number of kittens Patches gave birth to plus the 12 kittens Trixie gave birth to, we can substitute \(x\) to find the total number of kittens.

Given that the total number of kittens is \(7 + 3x + 12\), and knowing that the 7 kittens they already had plus the 3 times the number of kittens Patches gave birth to plus the 12 kittens Trixie gave birth to is the total number of kittens, we can solve for the total number of kittens directly:

\[7 + 3x + 12 = 7 + 3x + 12\]

Since \(3x + 12\) is the number of kittens from Patches and Trixie, and we know the total number of kittens they have now is the sum of the 7 kittens they already had plus the 3 times the number of kittens Patches gave birth to plus the 12 kittens Trixie gave birth to, we can substitute \(x = 2\) (since \(3 \times 2 = 6\) and \(6 + 12 = 18\)):

\[7 + 3 \times 2 + 12 = 7 + 6 + 12 = 25\]

Therefore, the total number of kittens they have now is:

According to the problem:
- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are still green.
- 2 oranges are sour.
- The remaining oranges are in good condition.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:
\[ 1 + 0.2x + 2 + \text{good oranges} = x \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3 + 0.2x + \text{good oranges} = x \]
\[ \text{good oranges} = x - 3 - 0.2x \]
\[ \text{good oranges} = 0.8x - 3 \]

We also know that the number of good oranges is 25:
\[ 0.8x - 3 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 0.8x = 25 + 3 \]
\[ 0.8x = 28 \]
\[ x = \frac{28}{0.8} \]
\[ x = 35 \]

So, the total number of oranges is 35. The number of good oranges is:

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% per month, so for 3 months, the total interest is:
\[ \$750 \times 2\% \times 3 = \$750 \times 0.02 \times 3 = \$45 \]

Adding the interest to the original cost gives us the total amount to be paid:
\[ \$750 + \$45 = \$795 \]

Since the payment is to be made over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ \frac{\$795}{3} = \$265 \]

Therefore, the amount that should be paid each month is:
\[\boxed{265}\]",265,255

mgsm-ja-75,"To solve this problem, let's denote the area of the topmost (4th) layer as \( A_4 \). According to the problem, \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet.

Given that each layer's area is half the area of the layer below it, we can express the areas of the other layers in terms of \( A_4 \):

- The area of the 3rd layer, \( A_3 \), is \( \frac{A_4}{2} \).
- The area of the 2nd layer, \( A_2 \), is \( \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{A_4}{4} \).
- The area of the 1st layer, \( A_1 \), is \( \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{A_4}{8} \).

Now, let's calculate the areas of each layer:

- \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet.
- \( A_3 = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- \( A_2 = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \) square feet.
- \( A_1 = \frac{16}{8} = 2 \) square feet.

Next, we find the total area of all four layers:

\[ A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average area of the four layers, we divide the total area by the number of layers:

\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average area of each layer is \( 7.5 \) square feet.

mgsm-ja-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 Days:**
   - Cecilia needs to give 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - There are 180 days in the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food required for the first 180 days = 180 cups.

2. **Remaining Days of the Year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - The first 180 days are accounted for, so the remaining days = 365 - 180 = 185 days.
   - For the remaining 185 days, Cecilia needs to give 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food required for the remaining 185 days = 185 cups.

3. **Total Dog Food Required for the First Year:**
   - Total dog food required = 180 cups (first 180 days) + 185 cups (remaining 185 days) = 365 cups.

4. **Number of Bags Needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = Total dog food required / Dog food per bag = 365 cups / 110 cups per bag.
   - Number of bags needed = 3.318181818181818.

mgsm-ja-78,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 roses under both pricing options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if we buy the roses in the 3-pack option:
- Each 3-pack costs $2.50.
- To find out how many 3-packs are needed for 18 roses, we divide 18 by 3: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
- Therefore, the total cost for 6 packs is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if we buy the roses in the 2-pack option:
- Each 2-pack costs $1.
- To find out how many 2-packs are needed for 18 roses, we divide 18 by 2: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
- Therefore, the total cost for 9 packs is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The cost with the 3-pack option is $15.
- The cost with the 2-pack option is $9.
- The savings by choosing the 2-pack option is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

1. **Initial amount of water:**
   Let's assume the initial amount of water is \( W \) liters.

2. **First step: 2 girls each drink 24 liters of water.**
   Each girl drinks 24 liters, so together they drink:
   \[
   2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ liters}
   \]
   After this, the remaining amount of water is:
   \[
   W - 48
   \]

3. **Second step: The water is divided into 6 equal parts.**
   Since the total water is \( W - 48 \) liters, each part is:
   \[
   \frac{W - 48}{6} \text{ liters}
   \]
   Each girl drinks 24 liters, which is 6 parts (since \( 24 = 6 \times \frac{W - 48}{6} \)). Therefore, the remaining water after the girls drink is:
   \[
   6 \times \frac{W - 48}{6} - 24 = W - 48 - 24 = W - 72
   \]

4. **Third step: The boy drinks 6 liters of water.**
   After the boy drinks 6 liters, the remaining amount of water is:
   \[
   (W - 72) - 6 = W - 78
   \]

Thus, the amount of water that is left is \( W - 78 \) liters. Since the initial amount \( W \) is not specified and we are only asked for the remaining amount, the final answer is:

2. **Second Alarm:** The second alarm rang for a duration that is 3 times the duration of the first alarm.
   - Duration of the second alarm: \( 3t_1 \).

3. **Third Alarm:** The third alarm rang for a duration that is half the duration of the second alarm.
   - Duration of the third alarm: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3t_1 = \frac{3t_1}{2} \).

Now, we need to sum up the total duration of all alarms:
- Total duration = \( t_1 + 3t_1 + \frac{3t_1}{2} \).

To add these, we need a common denominator:
- Total duration = \( t_1 + 3t_1 + \frac{3t_1}{2} = t_1 + 3t_1 + 1.5t_1 = 5.5t_1 \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact duration \( t_1 \), but asks for the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to consider the number of times each alarm rang, not the duration.

- First alarm rang 4 times.
- Second alarm rang \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) times.
- Third alarm rang \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) times.

- Tom plants 10 trees each year.
- Tom cuts down 2 trees each year.
- Net increase in trees per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

**Step 2: Determine the number of trees after 10 years.**

- Tom starts with 50 trees.
- After 10 years, the number of trees can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Number of trees after 10 years} = 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of trees that will be lost due to 30% of the trees dying.**

- 30% of the trees will die.
- Number of trees that will die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 \times 130 = 39 trees.
- Number of trees that will remain = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Thus, the number of trees that will remain after 10 years is $\boxed{91}$.",91,91

1. **Determine the number of articles for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits 1,000 articles in total.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of articles for Publisher A.
   - Therefore, the number of articles for Publisher B is \( 1000 - x \).

2. **Set up the relationship between the payments:**
   - Publisher A pays $0.05 per article.
   - Publisher B pays 2 times what Publisher A pays, which is \( 2 \times 0.05 = 0.10 \) per article.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each publisher:**
   - Earnings from Publisher A: \( x \times 0.05 \)
   - Earnings from Publisher B: \( (1000 - x) \times 0.10 \)

4. **Sum the earnings:**
   - Total earnings \( E \) = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
   \[
   E = x \times 0.05 + (1000 - x) \times 0.10
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**

First, let's calculate the cost per cup for the 20-dozens of cups. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 20-dozens of cups would be:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]
The total cost for 20-dozens of cups is $6000. Therefore, the cost per cup is:
\[ \frac{6000}{240} = 25 \text{ dollars per cup} \]

Next, let's denote the cost per plate for the half-dozens of plates as \( x \) dollars. Since 1 half-dosen equals 6, the total cost for half-dozens of plates is $1200. Therefore, the cost per plate is:
\[ \frac{1200}{6} = 200 \text{ dollars per plate} \]

The problem states that the cost of 20-dozens of cups is $1200 cheaper than the cost of half-dozens of plates. Since the cost per cup is $25 and the cost per plate is $200, we can set up the following equation to verify the difference:
\[ 20 \times 12 \times 25 = 240 \times 25 = 6000 \]
\[ 6000 - 1200 = 4800 \]
This confirms that the cost of 20-dozens of cups is indeed $1200 cheaper than the cost of half-dozens of plates.

Therefore, the cost per cup is $25. The answer is:

\[ x + (x + 50) + \text{customers on the third day} = 500 \]

Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( y \). Therefore, the equation becomes:

To find \( x \), we need to recognize that the problem does not provide additional constraints on \( x \). Given the setup, we can assume \( x \) is a reasonable number that fits the context. Let's solve for \( y \) by considering the total number of customers over the three days.

Since the problem states that the total number of customers over three days is 500, and we have:

\[ y = 150 \]

   - Therefore, Adrian's age is \( 3 \times 21 = 63 \) years.

2. **Determine Zack's Age:**
   - We know that Harriet's age is half of Zack's age.
   - Harriet is 21 years old.
   - Therefore, Zack's age is \( 21 \times 2 = 42 \) years.

3. **Calculate their Ages in 3 Years:**
   - Adrian's age in 3 years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \) years.
   - Harriet's age in 3 years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \) years.
   - Zack's age in 3 years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \) years.

4. **Calculate the Average Age in 3 Years:**
   - Sum of their ages in 3 years: \( 66 + 24 + 45 = 135 \) years.
   - Average age in 3 years: \( \frac{135}{3} = 45 \) years.

Thus, the average age of the three in 3 years will be 45. The final answer is:

mgsm-ja-219,"To determine how many points JoJo scored, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total Points**: The total points scored by all four students is 251.
2. **Naomi's Points**: Naomi scored 68 points.
3. **Yuri's Points**: Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's points by 10 points. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Therefore, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
4. **Briana's Points**: Briana scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, Briana scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we can calculate the points scored by JoJo by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Briana from the total points:

\[
\text{JoJo's Points} = \text{Total Points} - (\text{Naomi's Points} + \text{Yuri's Points} + \text{Briana's Points})
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{JoJo's Points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
\]

Calculate the sum of Naomi's, Yuri's, and Briana's points:

\[
68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

Now, subtract this sum from the total points:

\[
251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, JoJo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points.",54,54

mgsm-ja-228,"To determine how long it will take to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate the combined rate at which Karinda and her mother can assemble the puzzle pieces.

First, we calculate Karinda's rate:
- Karinda can assemble 4 pieces per minute.

Next, we calculate her mother's rate:
- Her mother can assemble half the number of pieces Karinda can, so she can assemble \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate:
- Combined rate = Karinda's rate + Mother's rate = 4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute.

To find the total time required to assemble 360 pieces, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

1. Initially, there are 120 small watermelons in the farm.

2. After 2 months, 30% of the watermelons are harvested. 
   - Number of watermelons harvested = 30% of 120 = \(0.30 \times 120 = 36\)
   - Number of watermelons remaining = 120 - 36 = 84

3. After another 2 weeks, 4/3 (or 1.333...) of the remaining watermelons are harvested. Since we can't harvest more than what's left, we consider the maximum possible harvest from the remaining 84 watermelons.
   - Number of watermelons harvested = 4/3 of 84 = \( \frac{4}{3} \times 84 = 112 \)
   - However, since we only have 84 watermelons left, we can only harvest the entire remaining amount.
   - Number of watermelons harvested = 84

   - This can be represented as: \(60\).

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   - In the second month, the downloads increased by 3 times compared to the first month.
   - Calculation: \(60 \times 3 = 180\).
   - This can be represented as: \(180\).

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   - In the third month, the downloads decreased by 30% compared to the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of the second month's downloads: \(180 \times 0.30 = 54\).
   - Then, subtract this from the second month's downloads: \(180 - 54 = 126\).
   - This can be represented as: \(126\).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Sum the downloads from all three months: \(60 + 180 + 126 = 366\).

mgsm-ja-12,"To determine how many years Carlos needs to make a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate his annual profit and then find out when it becomes positive.

First, let's outline the costs and revenues:
- Cost of planting the lemon tree: $90
- Revenue per lemon: $1.50
- Number of lemons per year: 7
- Cost of watering and fertilizing the tree per year: $3

Next, we calculate the annual revenue from the lemons:
\[ \text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.50/\text{lemon} = \$10.50 \]

Now, we calculate the annual profit:
\[ \text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = \text{Cost of planting} + \text{Cost of watering and fertilizing} \]
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = \$90 + \$3 = \$93 \]
\[ \text{Annual Profit} = \$10.50 - \$93 = -\$82.50 \]

mgsm-ja-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

According to the problem, we know:
- \( \frac{1}{3}x \) of the vacuum cleaners were sold in the green house.
- 2 vacuum cleaners were sold in the red house.
- The remaining vacuum cleaners (after selling in the green and red houses) were sold in the orange house, which is half of the remaining vacuum cleaners.

After selling in the green and red houses, the remaining vacuum cleaners are:
\[ x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 = \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \]

According to the problem, these remaining vacuum cleaners were sold in the orange house, which is half of the remaining vacuum cleaners:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \]

After selling in the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{3}x - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x - 2 - \left( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 \right) = 5 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{3}x + 1 = 5 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{1}{3}x \right) - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 18 \]

mgsm-ja-15,"To determine which option maximizes the profit, we need to calculate the total cost for each option after accounting for the expected price increases.

**Option 1: Buying the 5,000 dollars worth of gems**

- Initial cost of gems: $5,000
- Expected price increase for gems: 2.5%
- Cost after price increase: $5,000 \times (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 \times 1.025 = $5,125

**Option 2: Buying the 8,000 dollars worth of electronics**

- Initial cost of electronics: $8,000
- Expected price increase for electronics: 1.2%
- Cost after price increase: $8,000 \times (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 \times 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we compare the costs of the two options to determine which one maximizes profit:

- Cost of buying gems: $5,125
- Cost of buying electronics: $8,096

Clearly, buying the gems results in a lower cost and thus higher profit. The difference in cost is:

$8,096 - $5,125 = $2,971

Therefore, the profit when choosing to buy the gems is $2,971.

mgsm-ja-19,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average speed required for the remaining distance of the hike.

First, let's calculate the total distance and the time already spent:
- Total distance: 12 miles
- Distance covered in the first 4 miles: 4 miles
- Distance covered in the next 2 miles: 2 miles
- Time spent on the first 6 miles: 2 hours

Next, we calculate the remaining distance and the time remaining:
- Remaining distance: \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles
- Time remaining: \(1 - 2 = -1\) hour (This indicates the time already spent is more than the total time required, so we need to re-evaluate the total time needed.)

The average speed required for the entire hike is 4 miles per hour:
- Total time required for 12 miles at 4 miles per hour: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \)

Since the actual time spent is 2 hours, we need to find the speed required for the remaining 6 miles in the remaining time:
- Remaining time: \(3 - 2 = 1\) hour
- Speed required for the remaining 6 miles: \( \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \)

Therefore, the speed required for the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange juice:**
   - The orange juice is 3/2 (or 1.5) parts water out of 10 parts total.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange juice is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{2} \times 10 = 15 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 5/3 (or approximately 1.67) parts water out of 15 parts total.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:

     25 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} = 24 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - The ratio of water to the total liquid in the orange juice is 15/25 (since 15 liters of water are in 25 liters of liquid).
   - The ratio of water to the total liquid in the pineapple drink is 25/40 (since 25 liters of water are in 40 liters of liquid).
   - The combined ratio of water to the total liquid in the mixture is:
     \[
     \frac{15}{25} + \frac{25}{40} = \frac{3}{5} + \frac{5}{8} = \frac{24}{40} + \frac{25}{40} = \frac{49}{40}

   - Since 1 liter of orange juice was spilled, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
     \[
     29.4 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters (water from orange juice)} = 14.4 \text{ liters}

2. Raymond is 23 years old when he has a son.
3. Samantha is 31 years old now.

From point 2, we can deduce that Raymond is currently 23 years old. Since Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, we can calculate Samantha's current age as follows:

\[ \text{Raymond's age} = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 \]
\[ 23 = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Samantha's age} = 23 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Samantha's age} = 17 \]

So, Samantha is currently 17 years old. Given that Samantha is now 31 years old, the difference in their ages is:

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can translate these into the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

   Dana can skip at half the speed of running. Let's denote her running speed as \( R \) and her skipping speed as \( S \).

   Given:
   \[
   S = \frac{R}{2}
   \]

   We are told that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour:
   \[
   S = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{R}{2} = 3 \implies R = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

3. **Calculate the distances covered in different modes of movement:**
   - **Running for 1/3 of an hour:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = R \times \frac{1}{3} = 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \text{ miles}

Each guest can take 8 slices from the 5 pies. Therefore, each guest can take \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) slices.

After the guests had their fill, 14 pies were left. Since each pie is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices available initially was \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) slices per pie, which is 40 slices in total.

If 14 pies were left, and each pie has 8 slices, the total number of slices left is \( 14 \times 8 = 112 \) slices. This means that the guests took \( 40 - 112 = 28 \) slices in total.

Since each guest took 40 slices, the number of guests \( G \) can be calculated by dividing the total slices taken by the slices each guest took:

\[ G = \frac{28}{40} \]

However, since the number of guests must be a whole number, and the calculation above shows a fraction, it indicates that the guests could not have taken exactly 28 slices if there were a fractional number of guests. This suggests a need to recheck the problem constraints or the interpretation, but the logical calculation based on the given data is:

mgsm-ja-102,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Weekdays:**
   - John drinks 1 cup of water at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - Therefore, he drinks \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) cups of water each day on weekdays.

2. **Weekends:**
   - John drinks 1 cup of water at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - However, on weekends, he drinks soda instead of water at dinner.
   - Therefore, he drinks \(1 + 1 + 0 = 2\) cups of water each day on weekends.

3. **Total Water Consumption:**
   - There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total water consumed on weekdays: \(3 \text{ cups/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cups}\).
   - Total water consumed on weekends: \(2 \text{ cups/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ cups}\).
   - Total water consumed in a week: \(15 \text{ cups} + 4 \text{ cups} = 19 \text{ cups}\).

4. **Water Consumption Over a Month (Assuming 4 Weeks):**
   - Total water consumed in 4 weeks: \(19 \text{ cups/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 76 \text{ cups}\).

5. **Water Consumption Over a Year (Assuming 52 Weeks):**
   - Total water consumed in 52 weeks: \(19 \text{ cups/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 988 \text{ cups}\).

6. **Water Consumption Over a Month (4 Weeks):**
   - We need to find how many times more water John drinks in a month compared to a week.
   - Ratio: \(\frac{76 \text{ cups}}{19 \text{ cups}} = 4\).

Therefore, John drinks 4 times more water in a month than he does in a week.

The final answer is $\boxed{4}$.",4,26
mgsm-ja-103,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for the fog barrier to cover the entire length of the town.

1. We know that the fog barrier covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
2. The town is 42 miles long.
3. We need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles.

\[
\text{Number of 3-mile segments} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
\]

4. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time per segment to get the total time.

\[
\text{Total time} = 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}

3. **Pieces put in place by Poopy's mother**:
   - Poopy's mother puts in 3/4 (which is 1000 * 3/4 = 1000 * 0.75 = 750 pieces).

4. **Total pieces put in place**:
   - Total pieces put in place = Pieces by Poopy + Pieces by Poopy's mother = 250 + 750 = 1000 pieces.

5. **Pieces left unplaced**:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours
- Total for the week: 7 hours

The total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday is 7 hours. The time spent on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday are known, so we can calculate the time spent on Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

First, let's denote the amount of sugar used as \( S \) teaspoons and the amount of water used as \( W \) teaspoons. According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so we can write:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

This implies:
\[ S = \frac{7}{13}W \]

We also know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \) into the equation \( S + W = 120 \), we get:
\[ \frac{7}{13}W + W = 120 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7W + 13W}{13} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20W}{13} = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( W \):
\[ 20W = 120 \times 13 \]
\[ 20W = 1560 \]
\[ W = \frac{1560}{20} \]
\[ W = 78 \]

So, the amount of water used is 78 teaspoons. Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \):
\[ S = \frac{7}{13} \times 78 \]
\[ S = 7 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is \( 42 \). Enclosing the final answer, we get:

   - The problem states that there are 12 times as many worker bees as baby bees.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
   - Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 12B \).

2. **Determine the number of queen bees:**
   - The problem states that there are twice as many worker bees as queen bees.
   - Let \( Q \) represent the number of queen bees.
   - Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 2Q \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - From the above, we know \( 12B = 2Q \).
   - Simplify this equation to find \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
     \[
     12B = 2Q \implies B = \frac{2Q}{12} = \frac{Q}{6}
     \]

4. **Total number of bees:**
   - The total number of bees (worker bees + baby bees + queen bees) is 700.
   - Substitute \( B = \frac{Q}{6} \) into the total number of bees:
     \[
     12B + B + Q = 700

     \]
     \[
     3Q + \frac{Q}{6} = 700
     \]

5. **Combine terms:**
   - To combine the terms, find a common denominator:
     \[
     3Q = \frac{18Q}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{18Q}{6} + \frac{Q}{6} = 700
     \]
     \[
     \frac{19Q}{6} = 700

6. **Solve for \( Q \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     19Q = 4200
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 19:
     \[
     Q = \frac{4200}{19} \approx 221.05
     \]
   - Since the number of bees must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number:
     \[
     Q = 221
     \]

7. **Calculate the number of worker bees:**
   - Using \( Q = 221 \):
     \[
     B = \frac{Q}{6} = \frac{221}{6} \approx 36.83
     \]
   - Again, rounding to the nearest whole number:
     \[
     B = 37

   - The number of worker bees is:
     \[
     12B = 12 \times 37 = 444

According to the problem:
- Charlie has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so \( 3D = 12 \).

First, we solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

mgsm-ja-150,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to reach the school and then find out how long Steve has to wait for Tim to finish the race.

First, let's convert all distances to the same unit. Since 1 mile = 5280 feet, we can convert the distances:

- Steve's distance to school: \(3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 = 15720 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance to school: \(2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach the school:

- Time for Steve to reach school:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15720 \text{ feet}}{1440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 11 \text{ minutes}
  \]
  (since 1 minute = 60 seconds, 1 minute 440 feet = 1440 feet)

- Time for Tim to reach school:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Steve finishes the race in 11 minutes, and Tim finishes in 40 minutes. Therefore, Steve has to wait for Tim for:

\[
40 \text{ minutes} - 11 \text{ minutes} = 29 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the time Steve has to wait is \(\boxed{29}\).",29,4

1. Each tire inflation costs 25 cents.
2. For a bicycle, there are 2 tires.
3. For a tricycle, there are 3 tires.
4. For a unicycle, there are 1 tire.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each type of vehicle:

- For 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 5 \times 2 \times 25 = 250 \text{ cents}\)
- For 3 tricycles: \(3 \times 3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 = 225 \text{ cents}\)
- For 1 unicycle: \(1 \times 1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 1 \times 1 \times 25 = 25 \text{ cents}\)

Next, we sum up the earnings from all the vehicles:

\[ 250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar, we convert the total earnings to dollars:

1. Debra ate 14 chips.
2. The seagull got half of what Debra left, which is \( \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) \).
3. Three pigeons each took 3 chips, which totals \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) chips.
4. After the pigeons, the raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining chips.
5. After the raccoon, 5 chips were left.

Let's work backwards to find \( x \).

- After the raccoon, 5 chips were left, which means before the raccoon took its share, there were \( 5 \times \frac{3}{2} = 7.5 \). Since we can't have half a chip, this means before the raccoon took its share, there were 8 chips.
- Before the pigeons took their chips, there were \( 8 + 9 = 17 \) chips.
- Before the seagull took its chips, there were \( 17 + \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) = 17 + \frac{x - 14}{2} \).
- Before Debra ate 14 chips, there were \( 17 + \frac{x - 14}{2} + 14 = 31 + \frac{x - 14}{2} \).

Since the total number of chips before Debra ate was \( x \), we set up the equation:
\[ 31 + \frac{x - 14}{2} = x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 31 + \frac{x - 14}{2} = x \]
\[ 62 + x - 14 = 2x \]
\[ 48 = x \]

Therefore, the total number of potato chips in the original package was \( \boxed{48} \).",48,48

mgsm-ja-156,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of each type of animal:**
   - Let's assume there are \( x \) apes, \( y \) gorillas, and \( z \) hippos in the zoo.

2. **Calculate the monthly requirement of bananas for each type of animal:**
   - Each ape needs 200 bananas per month.
   - Each gorilla needs 400 bananas per month.
   - Each hippo needs 100 bananas per month.

3. **Calculate the total monthly requirement of bananas for all animals:**
   - Total bananas for apes per month = \( 200x \)
   - Total bananas for gorillas per month = \( 400y \)
   - Total bananas for hippos per month = \( 100z \)
   - Total monthly requirement = \( 200x + 400y + 100z \)

4. **Calculate the total requirement for 2 months:**
   - Total bananas for 2 months = \( 2 \times (200x + 400y + 100z) = 400x + 800y + 200z \)

5. **Determine the number of bananas ordered from the farm:**
   - The farmer supplies 2000 bananas every 2 months.
   - Therefore, the number of bananas ordered from the farm for 2 months = 2000.

6. **Set up the equation:**
   - We know the total requirement for 2 months must equal the number of bananas ordered.
   - Thus, \( 400x + 800y + 200z = 2000 \).

7. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Divide the entire equation by 200 to simplify:
   - \( 2x + 4y + z = 10 \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of each type of animal, we assume the simplest case where the number of each type of animal is such that the equation holds true. For instance, if we assume \( x = 1 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( z = 0 \), we get:
   - \( 2(1) + 4(1) + 0 = 6 \), which does not satisfy \( 2x + 4y + z = 10 \).

Another possible solution could be \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( z = 0 \):
   - \( 2(2) + 4(1) + 0 = 8 \), which also does not satisfy \( 2x + 4y + z = 10 \).

Finally, if we assume \( x = 1 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( z = 2 \):
   - \( 2(1) + 4(1) + 2 = 8 \), which does not satisfy \( 2x + 4y + z = 10 \).

After trying different combinations, we find that \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( z = 0 \) works:
   - \( 2(2) + 4(1) + 0 = 8 \), which does not satisfy \( 2x + 4y + z = 10 \).

Thus, the correct combination is \( x = 1 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( z = 2 \):
   - \( 2(1) + 4(1) + 2 = 8 \), which satisfies \( 2x + 4y + z = 10 \).

Therefore, the total number of bananas required for 2 months is:
   - \( 400(1) + 800(1) + 200(2) = 400 + 800 + 400 = 1600 \).

   - The initial 11 minus the 6 that came out equals 5 oto-masu-jakushi still hidden.
3. Among the hidden ones, 2 of them move to hide under the rocks.
   - This means 2 more oto-masu-jakushi are now hidden.
   - The 5 hidden ones minus the 2 that moved to hide under the rocks equals 3 oto-masu-jakushi still hidden.

Now, let's calculate the total number of oto-masu-jakushi that are visible:
- Initially visible: 11 - 6 = 5

mgsm-ja-174,"To determine how long it will take Billy to prepare 60 potatoes for the potato salad, we need to consider both the time he spends peeling the potatoes and the time he spends cutting them.

1. **Time to peel one potato:** 1.5 minutes
2. **Time to cut one potato:** 5 seconds

First, we need to convert the time for cutting one potato into minutes to match the time for peeling:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds} = \frac{5}{60} \text{ minutes} = \frac{1}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time for one potato (both peeling and cutting):
\[ \text{Total time for one potato} = 1.5 \text{ minutes} + \frac{1}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

To add these times, we need a common denominator:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = \frac{1.5 \times 12}{12} \text{ minutes} = \frac{18}{12} \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time for one potato} = \frac{18}{12} \text{ minutes} + \frac{1}{12} \text{ minutes} = \frac{19}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ \text{Total time for 60 potatoes} = 60 \times \frac{19}{12} \text{ minutes} \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 60 \times \frac{19}{12} = 60 \times 1.5833 = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to prepare 60 potatoes is:

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we need to determine the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a 6-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll} \mid \text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in percentage points between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% higher than the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:

   - We are given that she can skip at a speed of \( \frac{1}{2} \) of her running speed.
   - Therefore, her skipping speed is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4v_w = 2v_w \).
   - Given that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we have \( 2v_w = 3 \) miles per hour.
   - Solving for \( v_w \), we get \( v_w = \frac{3}{2} \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana's running speed is \( 4v_w = 4 \times \frac{3}{2} = 6 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the distance covered in 3/3 (1 hour) running:**
   - In 1 hour, running at 6 miles per hour, she covers \( 6 \) miles.

4. **Calculate the distance covered in 3/2 (1.5 hours) walking:**
   - In 1.5 hours, walking at \( \frac{3}{2} \) miles per hour, she covers \( 1.5 \times \frac{3}{2} = 2.25 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance covered in 6 hours:**
   - In 6 hours, she runs for 2 hours (since \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)).
   - She walks for 3 hours (since \( \frac{3}{3} \times 6 = 6 \)).
   - Distance covered running in 2 hours: \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) miles.
   - Distance covered walking in 3 hours: \( 3 \times \frac{3}{2} = 4.5 \) miles.
   - Total distance covered: \( 12 + 4.5 = 16.5 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana covers in 6 hours is $\\boxed{16.5}$.",5,18

1. Branden's iPhone is 4 times older than Ben's iPhone.
2. Ben's iPhone is 2 times older than Suzy's iPhone.
3. Suzy's iPhone has been used for 1 year.

From point 3, we know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Using point 2, we can deduce that Ben's iPhone is 2 years old (since it's 2 times older than Suzy's).

Using point 1, we can deduce that Branden's iPhone is 8 years old (since it's 4 times older than Ben's).

Now, we need to find out on which year Branden's iPhone is. Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, it means that Ben's iPhone was 1 year old at the same time Suzy's iPhone was new. Therefore, Branden's iPhone, which is 8 years old, would be in its 8th year.

polymath-low-ja-41,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distance with Gold Spear**: 
   - Without the sapphire, Polly can throw the gold spear 400 feet.

2. **Effect of Sapphire**:
   - With the sapphire, Polly can throw the gold spear 3 times further than without it.
   - Therefore, with the sapphire, Polly can throw the gold spear \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) feet.

3. **Range of Dragon's Flame**:
   - The dragon's flame covers 1000 feet.

4. **Calculating the Safe Distance**:
   - To ensure the dragon's flame does not reach Polly, she needs to be at least 1000 feet away from the dragon.
   - With the sapphire, Polly can throw the spear 1200 feet.

Since 1200 feet is greater than 1000 feet, Polly can be 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold spear.

Thus, the final answer is:

polymath-low-ja-42,"Let's denote the number of guests as \( G \).

Each guest took 8 pieces of pie. After the guests had eaten, 14 pieces of pie were left. This means the total number of pie pieces taken by the guests is the total number of pie pieces originally minus the 14 remaining pieces.

Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, and there were 5 pies, so the total number of pie pieces was:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

If 14 pieces were left, then the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

Since each guest took 8 pieces, the number of guests \( G \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces taken by 8:
\[ G = \frac{26}{8} \]

Since \( G \) must be a whole number, we need to check if 26 is divisible by 8. Performing the division:
\[ 26 \div 8 = 3.25 \]

Since 26 is not divisible by 8, it indicates there might be a misinterpretation or a need to recheck the problem setup. However, based on the given conditions, we can conclude that the number of guests is:
\[ G = 3 \text{ (since 3 guests each taking 8 pieces is the closest whole number)} \]

Thus, the total number of pies eaten by the guests is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of pies eaten by the guests is \(\boxed{24}\).",24,26

1. John buys 2 times as many red ties as blue ties, so \( R = 2B \).
2. The price of a red tie is 150% of the price of a blue tie. Since a blue tie costs $40, a red tie costs \( 1.5 \times 40 = $60 \).
3. John spends $200 on blue ties. Therefore, the number of blue ties he buys is \( B = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \).

Now we can find the number of red ties:
\[ R = 2B = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ties:
- Cost of blue ties: \( 5 \times 40 = 200 \) dollars
- Cost of red ties: \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) dollars

polymath-low-ja-66,"To determine the total number of people participating in the basketball tournament from all four schools, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Each school has two teams: one women's basketball team and one men's basketball team.
2. Each team consists of 5 players.
3. Each school also has one coach.

Let's calculate the number of participants per school:
- Number of players per team = 5
- Number of teams per school = 2
- Total players per school = \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \)
- Number of coaches per school = 1
- Total participants per school = \( 10 + 1 = 11 \)

Since there are 4 schools participating in the tournament, we need to find the total number of participants from all schools:
- Total participants = \( 11 \times 4 = 44 \)

Therefore, the total number of people participating from all schools is \(\boxed{44}\).",44,48
polymath-low-ja-67,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- The number of diamonds is 175.
- The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds.
- The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.

First, calculate the number of rubies:
\[ \text{Number of rubies} = \text{Number of diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, calculate the number of emeralds:
\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Number of rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, sum up all the gems to find the total number of gems in the treasure chest:
\[ \text{Total number of gems} = \text{Number of diamonds} + \text{Number of rubies} + \text{Number of emeralds} = 175 + 140 + 280 \]

Adding these numbers:
\[ 175 + 140 = 315 \]

2. The number of boys is twice the number of girls. Therefore, the number of boys is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
3. The ratio of teachers to students is 1:5, meaning for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher.
4. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:
\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Now, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers:
\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers is \(\boxed{36}\).",36,36
polymath-low-ja-69,"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Initially, Bailey had some amount of money.
2. For 8 weeks, Bailey received a weekly allowance of $5.
3. After 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Bailey received as an allowance over 8 weeks:
\[ 8 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ dollars/week} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that after receiving this allowance, Bailey had a total of $100. This total includes her initial amount plus the $40 she received in allowances. Let's denote her initial amount as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

Thus, Bailey initially had $60. Enclosing the final number, we get:

polymath-low-ja-70,"To determine how much Judy earns in a week, we need to calculate her earnings from both weekdays and Saturday, then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 dance classes each weekday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- Each student pays $15.

So, the number of students she teaches each weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

Her earnings per weekday are:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 1125 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, her total earnings from weekdays are:
\[ 1125 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5625 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings on Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- Each student pays $15.

So, the number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings on Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up her earnings from weekdays and Saturday to find her total weekly earnings:
\[ 5625 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Judy earns \(\boxed{7425}\) dollars in a week.",7425,7425

1. **First 180 Days:**
   - Cecilia needs to feed the dog 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - There are 180 days in the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food needed for the first 180 days = 180 cups.

2. **Remaining Days of the First Year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - The remaining days after the first 180 days are 365 - 180 = 185 days.
   - For the remaining days, Cecilia needs to feed the dog 2 cups of dog food per day.

1. Initially, Ram bought 25 pens.
2. Each pen uses 5 empty ink pens to refill it.
3. Therefore, to refill 25 pens, he needs \(25 \times 5 = 125\) empty ink pens.

After using the 25 pens, he has 125 empty ink pens.

4. With these 125 empty ink pens, he can refill 1 pen, and he will have 124 empty ink pens left.
5. Now, he has 1 pen and 124 empty ink pens. He can refill another pen with these 124 empty ink pens, and he will have 123 empty ink pens left.
6. He continues this process until he can no longer refill a pen.

Let's calculate the total number of pens he can refill:

- 1 pen (initially bought) + 1 pen (refilled with 5 empty ink pens) + 1 pen (refilled with 5 more empty ink pens) + ... 

This process continues until he has fewer than 5 empty ink pens left, which means he can only refill one more pen with the remaining empty ink pens.

So, the total number of pens he can use is:
- 1 (initially bought) + 2 (refilled once) + 3 (refilled twice) + ... + 25 (refilled 24 times) + 1 (last refill with 124 empty ink pens)

This is the sum of the first 25 natural numbers plus 1:

mgsm-ja-246,"To determine how much Gene paid, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost per session**: 1 hour of makeup costs $250.
2. **Time per session**: 6 hours.
3. **Number of sessions per week**: 4.
4. **Number of weeks**: 5.

First, calculate the cost for one makeup session:
\[ \text{Cost per session} = \$250 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for one makeup session:
\[ \text{Total cost per session} = 6 \text{ hours} \times \$250 = \$1500 \]

Then, calculate the total cost for makeup over the 4 sessions per week for 5 weeks:
\[ \text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} \times \$1500 = \$30000 \]

Since Gene received a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discounted amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } \$30000 = 0.10 \times \$30000 = \$3000 \]

Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Gene paid:
\[ \text{Amount Gene paid} = \$30000 - \$3000 = \$27000 \]

Therefore, the amount Gene paid is $\\boxed{27000}$.",27000,27000

1. **Initial Cost of the Tree:**
   - The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.

2. **Revenue per Lemon:**
   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

3. **Cost of Watering and Fertilizing:**
   - The cost to water and fertilize the tree each year is $3.

4. **Number of Lemons Produced per Year:**
   - The tree produces 7 lemons per year.

5. **Revenues per Year:**
   - Total revenue from 7 lemons at $1.5 each is \( 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \) dollars.

6. **Total Costs per Year:**
   - The total cost per year is the initial cost plus the annual costs of water and fertilizing: \( 90 + 3 = 93 \) dollars.

7. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit per year is the revenue minus the total costs: \( 10.5 - 93 = -82.5 \) dollars.

Since the profit per year is negative, Carlos is not making a profit in the first year. We need to find the number of years required for the initial cost to be recovered by the revenue.

8. **Recovery of Initial Cost:**
   - Each year, Carlos earns $10.5 in revenue.
   - To recover the initial $90 cost, we need to determine how many years it takes to earn $90 at a rate of $10.5 per year.
   - Number of years required to recover the cost: \( \frac{90}{10.5} \approx 8.57 \).

Since Carlos cannot have a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take 9 years for Carlos to recover the initial cost.

9. **Profit After 9 Years:**
   - After 9 years, the total revenue will be \( 9 \times 10.5 = 94.5 \) dollars.
   - The total costs will be \( 9 \times 93 = 837 \) dollars.
   - Profit after 9 years: \( 94.5 - 837 = -742.5 \) dollars (still negative).

Since the profit remains negative even after 9 years, we need to consider the next year to see if the profit becomes positive.

10. **Profit in the 10th Year:**
    - In the 10th year, the total revenue will be \( 10 \times 10.5 = 105 \) dollars.
    - The total costs will be \( 93 \) dollars.
    - Profit in the 10th year: \( 105 - 93 = 12 \) dollars.

   - Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners sold from the green house is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).

2. **Red House Sales**: 
   - The problem states that 2 vacuum cleaners were sold from the red house.
   - So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold from the red house is 2.

3. **Orange House Sales**: 
   - The remaining vacuum cleaners were sold from the orange house.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners sold from the orange house is \( x - \left( \frac{3}{4}x + 2 \right) = \frac{1}{4}x - 2 \).

4. **Remaining Vacuum Cleaners**:
   - Mélanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
   - Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold is \( x - 5 \).

5. **Equating the Total Sold to the Sum of Sales**:
   - The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of vacuum cleaners sold from each house.
   - Hence, \( x - 5 = \frac{3}{4}x + 2 + \left( \frac{1}{4}x - 2 \right) \).

6. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   \[
   x - 5 = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{1}{4}x + 2 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x - 5 = x
   \]
   \[
   x - 5 = x - 5
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - The equation is already balanced, confirming that the total number of vacuum cleaners sold is indeed \( x - 5 \).

polymath-low-ja-20,"To determine the amount of water in the final mixture, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water and orange juice in the original 10-liter orange juice mixture.
2. Calculate the amount of water and orange juice in the 15-liter pineapple drink mixture.
3. Determine the amount of orange juice and water after 1 liter of orange juice is spilled.
4. Calculate the final mixture's composition.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water and orange juice in the original 10-liter orange juice mixture.**

- Orange juice: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters
- Water: \( 10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \) liters

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water and orange juice in the 15-liter pineapple drink mixture.**

- Orange juice: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) liters
- Water: \( 15 - 5 = 10 \) liters

**Step 3: Determine the amount of orange juice and water after 1 liter of orange juice is spilled.**

- Initial orange juice: \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters
- Orange juice spilled: 1 liter
- Remaining orange juice: \( \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \approx 5.67 \) liters
- Initial water: \( \frac{10}{3} \) liters
- Water remains unchanged: \( \frac{10}{3} \) liters

**Step 4: Calculate the final mixture's composition.**

Total volume of the mixture:
\[ \frac{17}{3} + \frac{10}{3} = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Amount of water in the final mixture:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Percentage of water in the final mixture:
\[ \frac{\frac{10}{3}}{9} \times 100 = \frac{10}{27} \times 100 \approx 37.04\% \]

To find the actual amount of water in the final 24 liters:
\[ 24 \times \frac{10}{27} = \frac{240}{27} = \frac{80}{9} \approx 8.89 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the final mixture is:

1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken:**
   Marie ordered 12 chicken dishes at $3 each.
   \[
   12 \times 3 = 36
   \]
   So, the cost of the chicken is $36.

2. **Calculate the cost of the milk:**
   Marie ordered 5 packs of milk at $1.5 each.
   \[
   5 \times 1.5 = 7.5
   \]
   So, the cost of the milk is $7.5.

3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**

   \]
   So, the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is $49.5.

5. **Determine the amount spent on pizza:**
   Marie spent a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on pizza is:
   \[
   50 - 49.5 = 0.5
   \]
   So, Marie spent $0.5 on pizza.

6. **Calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered:**
   Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - Total number of students: 200
   - Fraction of students who are boys: \( \frac{2}{5} \)
   - Number of boys = \( 200 \times \frac{2}{5} = 80 \)

2. **Determine the number of girls:**
   - Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
   - Number of girls = \( 200 - 80 = 120 \)

3. **Determine the number of girls who are Girl Scouts:**
   - Fraction of girls who are Girl Scouts: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Number of Girl Scouts = \( 120 \times \frac{2}{3} = 80 \)

4. **Determine the number of girls who are not Girl Scouts:**
   - Number of girls who are not Girl Scouts = Total number of girls - Number of Girl Scouts
   - Number of girls who are not Girl Scouts = \( 120 - 80 = 40 \)

Therefore, the number of girls who are not Girl Scouts is 40.

First, let's understand the information given:
- Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
- The final batch of tomato sauce is 32 ounces.

We need to find out how many 16-ounce cans are in 32 ounces:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 2 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, for 2 cans, the total number of tomatoes used is:

1. Calculate the total number of pots Marie initially has.
2. Calculate the total number of pots Marie will give away.
3. Subtract the number of pots given away from the initial total.

First, we know Marie has 40 window frames and she has 18 new pots to place in them. Therefore, the total number of pots she initially has is:
\[ 40 \text{ (window frames)} \times 2 \text{ (pots per frame)} = 80 \text{ pots} \]

Next, Marie plans to give away one pot from each of the 40 window frames. Therefore, the number of pots she will give away is:
\[ 40 \text{ (window frames)} \times 1 \text{ (pot per frame)} = 40 \text{ pots} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pots given away from the initial total:
\[ 80 \text{ (initial pots)} - 40 \text{ (pots given away)} = 40 \text{ (pots remaining)} \]

Therefore, the number of pots Marie will have left is:

1. **First Friend's Ringing:**
   - The first friend rings the doorbell 20 times.

2. **Second Friend's Ringing:**
   - The second friend rings the doorbell at 1/4 the rate of the first friend.
   - Therefore, the second friend rings the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) times.

3. **Third Friend's Ringing:**

   - The fourth friend rings the doorbell 60 times.

Now, we sum the number of times the doorbell was rung by all four friends:

\[
20 \text{ (first friend)} + 5 \text{ (second friend)} + 15 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} = 100

3. **Pieces placed by Poopy's mother**: 
   - Poopy's mother places 3/4 of the remaining pieces.

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankee watched 1 hour of his favorite episodes each day.
- On Wednesday, he watched some 30-minute episodes.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour of an episode and 30 minutes of another episode.
- On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1 hour each.

The total time Frankee spent watching TV is 7 hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 4 = 7.5 hours

However, Frankee only watched 7 hours in total. This discrepancy means we need to adjust the Wednesday time.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes Frankee watched on Wednesday as \( x \).

The total time spent watching TV can be represented as:
\[ 1 + 1 + x + 1.5 + 4 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 7.5 + x = 7 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 7 - 7.5 \]
\[ x = -0.5 \]

Since \( x \) cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The discrepancy must be due to the initial assumption that the total time spent is exactly 7 hours, which isn't possible with the given durations. However, if we consider the closest feasible scenario:

If Frankee watched 1 hour on Monday, 1 hour on Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 4 hours on Friday, the total is 7.5 hours. This means he must have watched 0.5 hours (30 minutes) on Wednesday to make the total 7 hours.

- Beatrice's fruit roll is 2 rolls wide.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit rolls Beatrice ate is \(24 \times 2 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the number of fruit rolls Marcel ate:

Now, we find the total number of fruit rolls eaten by both:
- Total fruit rolls eaten = Beatrice's fruit rolls + Marcel's fruit rolls = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we calculate the average number of fruit rolls eaten per person:

Given:
- The boat travels 10 feet before 2 liters of water enter.
- The distance to the shore is 64 seconds.

First, we need to find the rate at which water enters the boat. Since the boat travels 10 feet to gain 2 liters of water, the rate of water entry is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]

Next, we need to determine how many feet the boat travels in 64 seconds. Since the boat travels 10 feet in the time it takes to gain 2 liters of water, we can find the time it takes to travel 1 foot:
\[ \text{Time per foot} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 6.4 \text{ seconds per foot} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance the boat travels in 64 seconds:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times 1 \text{ foot/second} = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of water that enters the boat over this distance:
\[ \text{Total water} = 64 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that entered the boat before Julia reached the shore is:

- There are 4 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of class uses per day is \( 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ classes/teacher} = 8 \text{ classes} \).

Next, since each class uses the whiteboard 3 times, we calculate the total number of whiteboard uses per day:
- Each class uses the whiteboard 3 times.
- There are 8 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of whiteboard uses per day is \( 8 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ uses/class} = 24 \text{ uses} \).

Since the whiteboard is cleaned after each use, the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is equal to the number of whiteboard uses per day.

- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 and 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10.
- Total number of boards = 10 + 5 = 15 boards.
- Each board is sold at the same price as when she bought them, which we assume to be the same as the cost price (since the problem does not specify a different selling price).

Since the problem does not specify the selling price, we assume she sells them at the same cost price, which means the total revenue is the same as the total cost.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0.

The final answer is \boxed{0}.",0,90
polymath-low-ja-116,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar (let's call this \( S \)) are used when the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13.

First, let's denote the amount of sugar used as \( S \) and the amount of water used as \( W \). According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so we can write:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

This implies:
\[ S = \frac{7}{13}W \]

We also know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \) into the total amount equation, we get:
\[ \frac{7}{13}W + W = 120 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7W}{13} + \frac{13W}{13} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20W}{13} = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( W \):
\[ 20W = 120 \times 13 \]
\[ 20W = 1560 \]
\[ W = \frac{1560}{20} \]
\[ W = 78 \]

Now that we have \( W = 78 \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{7}{13} \times 78 \]
\[ S = 7 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42
polymath-low-ja-117,"To determine how much John spent on purchasing shoes for his three children, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost per pair of shoes**: Each pair of shoes costs $60.
2. **Determine the number of pairs needed**: John has 3 children, and he needs to purchase 2 pairs of shoes for each child. Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs/child} = 6 \text{ pairs}
   \]
3. **Calculate the total cost**: Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, John spent a total of $360.

polymath-low-ja-118,"Let's denote the number of containers checked on the first day as \( C_1 \) and the number of containers checked on the second day as \( C_2 \). According to the problem, each container contains 5 cars. 

On the first day, there are 2 containers, so the number of cars checked on the first day is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cars} \]

On the second day, the number of cars checked is:
\[ C_2 \times 5 \text{ cars} \]

After the second day, the total number of cars in the port is:
\[ 10 + C_2 \times 5 \]

We are given that the total number of cars in the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 10 + C_2 \times 5 = 30 \]

To find \( C_2 \), we solve the equation:
\[ 10 + 5C_2 = 30 \]
\[ 5C_2 = 20 \]
\[ C_2 = 4 \]

Thus, the number of containers that arrived on the second day is \( C_2 = 4 \).

The answer is:
\[ \\boxed{4} \]",4,4
polymath-low-ja-119,"Let's denote Adrian's initial salary as \( A \) andリア's initial salary as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Adrian's salary is 30% higher than Lira's salary.
\[ A = R + 0.3R = 1.3R \]
2. After 4 years, Adrian's salary is 40% higher than it was 4 years ago.
\[ A_{4\text{years}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A \]
3. Adrian's initial salary \( A \) is $40,000.
\[ A = 40,000 \]

Using the first piece of information:
\[ 40,000 = 1.3R \]
Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \]

If Adrian and Lira's salaries were the same, then initially:
\[ A = R \]
\[ 40,000 = R \]
But we know \( R \approx 30,769.23 \).

Now, if their salaries were the same, Adrian's salary would be \( 30,769.23 \) and Lira's would also be \( 30,769.23 \).

After 4 years, if their salaries were the same:
\[ A_{4\text{years}} = R_{4\text{years}} = 1.4R \]
\[ 1.4 \times 30,769.23 \approx 43,076.92 \]

Therefore, if their salaries were the same, their total salary after 4 years would be:
\[ 43,076.92 + 43,076.92 = 86,153.84 \]

So, the total salary they would receive after 4 years if their salaries were the same is:

polymath-low-ja-122,"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the total sleep time step by step.

1. **Sleep on Monday:**
   - Sade slept 8 hours on Monday.

2. **Sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - Sade slept 2 hours less each night than Monday.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - On Wednesday, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Sleep on the remaining days of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday):**
   - Sade slept 1 hour more each night than Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - Therefore, on Thursday, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
   - On Friday, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
   - On Saturday, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.

4. **Calculate total sleep for the week:**

polymath-low-ja-123,"To determine how many miles Rosy can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments and calculate the distance for each segment separately.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours (since the total time is 7 hours and the first segment is 3 hours)
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances from both segments to find the total distance Rosy can run in 7 hours:
- Total distance = Distance from first segment + Distance from second segment = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, the total distance Rosy can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50
polymath-low-ja-124,"Let's denote the total number of letters in the block of already stamped letters as \( x \).

According to the problem, 30 out of these \( x \) letters are already stamped. Therefore, \( x - 30 \) letters still need to be stamped.

Jenny needs to stamp 3/4 of the total letters in the block that still need to be stamped. This is because she stamps 3/4 of the 60 letters that need stamps.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times (x - 30) = 60 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x - 30 \):
\[ x - 30 = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ x - 30 = 80 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 80 + 30 \]
\[ x = 110 \]

Therefore, when Jenny started her work, the block of already stamped letters contained 110 letters.

The answer is \(\boxed{110}\).",110,10
