mgsm-es-47,"To determine how much John spent on the corbata, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of corbatas azules John bought:**
   John spent $200 on corbatas azules, and each corbata azula cost $40.
   \[
   \text{Number of corbatas azules} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of corbatas rojas John bought:**
   John bought the double of the number of corbatas azules in corbatas rojas.
   \[
   \text{Number of corbatas rojas} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of each corbata roja:**
   Each corbata roja costs 50% more than a corbata azula. Since each corbata azula costs $40:
   \[
   \text{Cost of each corbata roja} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the corbatas rojas:**
   John bought 10 corbatas rojas, each costing $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of corbatas rojas} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of all corbatas:**
   John spent $200 on corbatas azules and $600 on corbatas rojas.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 + 600 = 800
   \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on corbatas is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

mgsm-es-51,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Tom spends traveling, both out and back. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Calculate the distance Tom traveled out:**
   - Tom's speed out is 10 mph.
   - He traveled from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., which is 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance out} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to return:**
   - Tom's speed on the return trip is 6 mph.
   - The distance back is the same as the distance out, which is 30 miles.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   \[
   \text{Time back} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent traveling:**
   - Time out = 3 hours
   - Time back = 5 hours
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time Tom spends traveling is 8 hours. Enclosing the final number:

mgsm-es-52,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Uriah should remove from his bag based on the given conditions.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books he removes:
- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a pound.
- Therefore, the total weight of 30 comic books is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, let's denote the number of toys Uriah needs to remove as \( x \). Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a pound. Therefore, the total weight of the toys he removes is:
\[
x \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \text{ pounds}
\]

The total weight of the books and toys removed should sum up to 15 pounds:
\[
7.5 + \frac{x}{2} = 15
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 15 - 7.5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7.5
\]
\[
x = 7.5 \times 2
\]
\[
x = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah must remove 15 toys.

The final answer is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

mgsm-es-75,"Let's denote the area of the uppermost (top) floor as \( A_1 \). According to the problem, \( A_1 = 16 \) square feet.

Each subsequent floor will have half the area of the floor above it. Therefore, the area of the second floor \( A_2 \) will be:
\[ A_2 = \frac{A_1}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

Similarly, the area of the third floor \( A_3 \) will be:
\[ A_3 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet} \]

And the area of the fourth floor \( A_4 \) will be:
\[ A_4 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average area of one floor, we sum the areas of all four floors and divide by the number of floors:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet} \]

mgsm-es-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use during the first 180 days, we need to calculate the amount of food used in those days and then in the remaining days of her dog's life.

First, we calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days:
Cecilia needs 1 taza of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
So, the total amount of food used in the first 180 days is:
\[ 1 \text{ taza/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ tazas} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days in her dog's life after the first 180 days. Since the problem does not specify the lifespan of the dog, we assume the dog lives for a very long time, but we only need to calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days.

Now, we calculate the amount of food used in the remaining days of her dog's life. Since the problem does not specify the exact lifespan, we assume the dog lives for a very long time, but we only need to calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days.

The total amount of food used in the first 180 days is 180 tazas. Since each bag contains 110 tazas, we need to determine how many bags are used for 180 tazas:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ tazas}}{110 \text{ tazas/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \text{ bags} \]

Since Cecilia can only use whole bags of dog food, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

The number of bags Cecilia will use during the first year is:

From the problem, we know:
1. Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sarah.

First, we calculate the amount of laundry David washes:
\[ S = 400 \]
\[ S = 4D \]
\[ 400 = 4D \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the amount of laundry Raymond washes:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2}S \]
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \]

Now, we find the difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David:
\[ R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David is \(\boxed{100}\).",100,100

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child eats half the amount that an adult eats, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}

2. James is 1 year younger than Corey: Jm = C - 1
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: A = J + 5
4. Amy is 2 years older than Corey: A = C - 2
5. James is 1 year younger than Corey: Jm = C - 1

Since James is 10 years old, we can substitute Jm with 10 in the second equation:
\[ Jm = C - 1 \implies 10 = C - 1 \implies C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey is 11 years old, we can use the fourth equation to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \implies A = 11 - 2 \implies A = 9 \]

Next, we use the first equation to find Amy's age:

mgsm-es-196,"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that should be distributed.
2. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will actually be distributed.
3. Subtract the amount distributed from the total amount to find the unused amount.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that should be distributed. Since there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant should receive 2 pounds of carrots, the total amount of carrots that should be distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will actually be distributed. Since the city has 200 pounds of carrots and each of the 40 restaurants will receive 2 pounds, the total amount of carrots that will be distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find the difference between the total amount of carrots that should be distributed and the total amount of carrots that will be distributed. Since the actual distribution is exactly the same as the planned distribution, the unused amount of carrots is:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine starts with 20 cards.

2. **After the first month:**
   She has three times as many cards as she started with.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **After the second month:**
   She has 20 cards less than she had after the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **After the third month:**
   She has twice the total number of cards she had after the first and second months combined.
   First, we calculate the total number of cards after the first and second months:
   \[
   60 + 40 = 100 \text{ cards}
   \]
   Then, she has twice this amount:

mgsm-es-199,"To determine how much Mark earns in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the number of orations Mark reviews for each editorial.
   - Mark reviews a total of 1000 orations per week.
   - Let the number of orations Mark reviews for editorial A be \( x \).
   - Therefore, the number of orations Mark reviews for editorial B is \( 1000 - x \).

2. Determine the payment per oration for each editorial.
   - The editorial A pays 5 cents per oration.
   - The editorial B pays twice as much as editorial A, so it pays \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per oration.

3. Calculate the total earnings from each editorial.
   - Earnings from editorial A: \( x \times 5 \) cents.
   - Earnings from editorial B: \( (1000 - x) \times 10 \) cents.

4. Sum the earnings from both editorials to find the total weekly earnings.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 5x + 10(1000 - x) = 5x + 10000 - 10x = 10000 - 5x
   \]

5. Determine the value of \( x \). Since the problem does not specify the exact number of orations for each editorial, we can use the fact that the total number of orations is 1000 and the payments are based on the given rates. However, the equation \( 10000 - 5x \) will give us the total earnings in terms of \( x \). For the purpose of this problem, we can infer that the distribution of orations is not necessary to find the total earnings as long as the total number of orations is 1000 and the rates are given.

6. Calculate the total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 10000 - 5x
   \]
   Since the total number of orations is 1000 and the rates are given, we can directly calculate the total earnings as:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 10000 - 5x = 10000 - 5 \times 500 = 10000 - 2500 = 7500 \text{ cents}

- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara will earn from her activities:
- She earns $5 for each time she cares for her neighbor's children. She cares for them 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20.
- She earns $4 for each time she cuts the grass. Let's denote the number of times she needs to cut the grass as \( x \). So, she earns $4 * x = $4x.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after her earnings is:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least equal to the total cost of the items she wants to buy, which is $70. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]

Now, we substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:

\[ S - 16 = L - 16 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ S = L \]

After 4 more minutes (i.e., 8 minutes total), the amount of water left in the small pool is \( S - 8 \times 4 = S - 32 \) gallons, and the amount of water left in the large pool is \( L - 8 \times 4 = L - 32 \) gallons. According to the problem, at this point, the large pool has four times the amount of water in the small pool:
\[ L - 32 = 4(S - 32) \]
Since \( S = L \), we substitute \( L \) with \( S \):
\[ S - 32 = 4(S - 32) \]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[ S - 32 = 4S - 128 \]
\[ 96 = 3S \]
\[ S = 32 \]

So, the initial amount of water in the small pool is 32 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

- Harriet's age is half of Zack's age: \( H = \frac{Z}{2} \).

First, we calculate Adrian's current age:
\[
A = 3H = 3 \times 21 = 63

First, we calculate the time spent on the crucigrama. Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crucigrama. Since she solved 3 crucigrama, the total time spent on crucigrama is:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes/crucigrama} \times 3 \text{ crucigrama} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sudoku. Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku. Since she solved 8 sudokus, the total time spent on sudoku is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/sudoku} \times 8 \text{ sudoku} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on both the crucigrama and the sudoku to find the total time spent:

- Number of water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Number of grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards after these changes is:
- Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:

2. Determine the selling price based on the 150% increase.
3. Calculate the gain by subtracting the total cost from the selling price.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house after the repairs.**

The initial cost of the house is $80,000, and the cost for repairs is $50,000. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the selling price based on the 150% increase.**

A 150% increase means the selling price is 250% (100% original + 150% increase) of the total cost. So, we calculate 250% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 2.5 = 325,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the gain by subtracting the total cost from the selling price.**

The gain is the selling price minus the total cost:

1. The first vial costs $5.
2. The second vial costs $5 \times 0.60 = $3.
3. The third vial costs $3 \times 0.60 = $1.80.
4. The fourth vial costs $1.80 \times 0.60 = $1.08.
5. We can see that the cost of each subsequent vial is 60% of the previous one. This forms a geometric sequence where the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.60\).

The cost of the \(n\)-th vial can be expressed as:
\[ a_n = 5 \times (0.60)^{n-1} \]

To find the total cost for 16 vials, we need to sum the first 16 terms of this geometric sequence. The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

Substituting \(a = 5\), \(r = 0.60\), and \(n = 16\):
\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1-(0.60)^{16}}{1-0.60} = 5 \frac{1-(0.60)^{16}}{0.40} = 5 \times \frac{1-(0.60)^{16}}{0.40} = 12.5 \times (1-(0.60)^{16}) \]

Now, we need to calculate \((0.60)^{16}\):
\[ (0.60)^{16} \approx 0.001393115776 \]

So,
\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \times (1 - 0.001393115776) = 12.5 \times 0.998606884224 \approx 12.4825860528 \]

First, let's calculate the time it would take to download the file without any interruptions. The normal download speed is 2 GB per minute. Therefore, the time to download 200 GB is:
\[ \text{Time without interruptions} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the interruptions. The problem states that there is a 40% chance of a forced restart, and each restart takes 20 minutes. Since the restarts occur randomly, we can model the expected number of restarts as a random variable. However, for the purpose of calculating the expected time, we can consider the average case where the restarts happen at the average rate.

The probability of a restart is 40%, or 0.4. The expected number of restarts in a 100-minute download is:
\[ \text{Expected number of restarts} = 100 \times 0.4 = 40 \text{ restarts} \]

Each restart takes 20 minutes, so the total expected time for the restarts is:
\[ \text{Expected time for restarts} = 40 \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ minutes} \]

However, since the restarts happen during the download, they do not add to the total time of the download but rather to the total time spent. Therefore, the total time spent is the sum of the time spent downloading and the time spent on restarts:
\[ \text{Total time} = 100 \text{ minutes} + 800 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Carla spends downloading the file is:

   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
   So, the program had 180 downloads in the second month.

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month. First, we calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   180 \times 0.30 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]
   So, the program had 126 downloads in the third month.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
   \[
   60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

Therefore, the total number of downloads during the three months is \(\boxed{366}\).",366,366
mgsm-es-11,"To determine the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donas:
- Toula bought 3 docenas of donas.
- Each docena of donas costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donas is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini pastelillos:
- Toula bought 2 docenas of mini pastelillos.
- Each docena of mini pastelillos costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini pastelillos is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the tortitas de queso:
- Toula bought 6 docenas of tortitas de queso.
- Each docena of tortitas de queso costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the tortitas de queso is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
\[204 + 160 + 330 = 694\]

Thus, the total cost of all the pastries is \(\boxed{694}\).",694,694
mgsm-es-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this net profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

The net profit each year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = 10.5 - 93 = -82.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the net profit is negative each year, Carlos will not start making a profit until the total cost of the tree is covered by the revenue. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the tree starts producing lemons after the first year.

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
\[ \text{Number of years to cover initial cost} = \frac{90}{82.5} \approx 1.0909 \]

Since Carlos cannot wait a fraction of a year to start making a profit, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take Carlos 2 years to start making a profit.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]",2,13

3. The remaining aspiradoras after these sales were \(\frac{x}{3} + 2\).
4. She then sold half of the remaining aspiradoras in the house naranja, which means she sold \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right)\).
5. After selling in the house naranja, the number of aspiradoras left is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} + 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right)
   \]
6. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} + 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} + 2 - \frac{x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{6} + 1
   \]
7. According to the problem, the number of aspiradoras left is 5:
   \[
   \frac{x}{6} + 1 = 5
   \]
8. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{6} = 4 \implies x = 24

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Initial value of the jewelry: $5000
- Expected increase: 2.5%

The increase in value can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Increase} = 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \]

So, the future value of the jewelry will be:
\[ \text{Future value of jewelry} = 5000 + 125 = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic devices:
- Initial value of the electronic devices: $8000

mgsm-es-19,"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa has planned for the trip:**
   Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a total distance of 12 miles. The formula for average speed is:
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}}
   \]
   Solving for the total time:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent walking:**
   Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles. Therefore, the total time spent so far is:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time:**
   Since the total planned time is 3 hours and she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time is:
   \[
   3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:

2. Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple juice.
3. Determine the total amount of water after mixing.
4. Adjust for the liter of orange juice that was spilled.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange juice.**

The orange juice contains \(\frac{2}{3}\) of water. Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange juice is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple juice.**

The pineapple juice contains \(\frac{3}{5}\) of water. Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple juice is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount of water after mixing.**

When the orange juice and pineapple juice are mixed, the total amount of water is the sum of the water from each:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Adjust for the liter of orange juice that was spilled.**

After spilling 1 liter of orange juice, the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water remains the same, so the amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is:

   In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. First, we need to find 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes.
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the total points scored.
   The total points scored by Mike is the sum of the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the second 20 minutes.
   \[
   4 + 5 = 9

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\).",9,9
mgsm-es-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry needs for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of yogurts Terry needs to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price of the packs.

First, we calculate the total number of yogurts Terry needs for 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of yogurts Terry needs to buy. Since each pack contains 4 yogurts and costs $5, we divide the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per pack:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \text{ packs} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 15 packs:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ dollars/pack} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt during 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]",75,75
mgsm-es-37,"To determine how many Lego toys John has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his Lego toys.
2. Determine the total amount of money John spends on video games.
3. Use the information about the leftover money to find out how many Lego toys he originally had.
4. Subtract the number of Lego toys he sold from the original number to find out how many he has left.

Let's start with step 1. John sells each of his 13 Lego toys for $15. So, the total amount of money he earns is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, step 2. John spends this money on 8 video games, each costing $20. So, the total amount of money he spends is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, after buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the total amount of money he had initially (which is the amount he earned from selling the Lego toys) minus the amount he spent on the video games equals $5:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
But we know he has $5 left, so the correct equation is:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
This confirms our calculations are consistent.

Now, step 3. Since John spent $160 on video games and had $5 left after spending, he originally had:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]
But we already calculated he had $195, so the discrepancy is due to the leftover $5, confirming he had $195 initially.

Finally, step 4. John sold 13 Lego toys, so the number of Lego toys he has left is:
\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \]

Thus, the number of Lego toys John has left is:
\[
\boxed{0}

mgsm-es-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to first find out how many miles he runs each day. Let's denote the number of hours John runs on the second and third days as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- John runs a total of 60 miles per week.
- He runs for 3 days a week.
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the second and third days, he runs for \( x \) hours each day.

The total distance run on the first day is \( 3 \) miles (since the problem doesn't specify a different speed for the first day, we assume he runs at the same speed as the other days, which we will determine later).

The total distance run on the second and third days is \( 2x \) miles.

So, the equation for the total distance run in a week is:
\[ 3 + 2x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 57 \]
\[ x = 28.5 \]

So, John runs 28.5 miles on each of the second and third days.

Now, we need to find his speed. The speed is the total distance run divided by the total time run. The total time run in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours (first day)} + 28.5 \text{ hours (second day)} + 28.5 \text{ hours (third day)} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance run in a week is 60 miles. Therefore, the speed \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ hours}} = 1.2 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John's running speed is \(\boxed{1.2}\).",2,10
mgsm-es-39,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Dana's running speed, walking speed, and then calculate the distance she covers when running and walking over the given time period.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can jump at 3 miles per hour.
   - Since jumping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed \( R \) is:
     \[
     R = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana's walking speed \( W \) is four times her running speed:
     \[
     W = 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends a third of her time running and two-thirds walking.
   - Let \( t \) be the total time in hours. Then:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3}t
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3}t
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance covered while running:**
   - Distance running \( D_r \) is:
     \[
     D_r = R \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times \frac{1}{3}t = 2t \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the distance covered while walking:**
   - Distance walking \( D_w \) is:
     \[
     D_w = W \times \text{Time walking} = 24 \times \frac{2}{3}t = 16t \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total distance covered:**
   - Total distance \( D \) is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
     \[
     D = D_r + D_w = 2t + 16t = 18t \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Determine the total time \( t \) given that Dana runs for 6 hours:**
   - Since Dana runs for a third of her total time:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3}t = 6 \implies t = 18 \text{ hours}
     \]

8. **Calculate the total distance \( D \):**
   - Substitute \( t = 18 \) into the total distance formula:
     \[
     D = 18t = 18 \times 18 = 324 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can cover in six hours is \(\boxed{324}\).",324,18

mgsm-es-41,"To determine the distance Polly could be from the dragon while still being able to hit it with her gold javelin when she has the sapphire stone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the sapphire stone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the sapphire stone.
3. Find the difference between the distance with and without the sapphire stone.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the sapphire stone. With the sapphire stone, she can throw it three times as far. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the sapphire stone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's range is 1000 feet, so the distance Polly can be from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the javelin is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the distance Polly can be from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the javelin is \(\boxed{200}\).",200,200
mgsm-es-42,"To determine how many portions of apple pie were served, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of portions of apple pie available initially.
2. Subtract the number of portions that were left at the end from the total number of portions available.

First, we calculate the total number of portions of apple pie. Since La abuela Jones made 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 portions, the total number of portions is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ portions per pie} = 40 \text{ portions} \]

Next, we know that after the guests served themselves, there were 14 portions left. Therefore, the number of portions that were served is the total number of portions minus the number of portions left:
\[ 40 \text{ portions} - 14 \text{ portions} = 26 \text{ portions} \]

So, the number of portions that were served is:

mgsm-es-43,"To determine how many grams of potato chips the person can still eat while staying within their daily calorie goal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories the person can still consume.
2. Determine how many calories are in one portion of potato chips.
3. Calculate how many portions the person can consume with the remaining calories.
4. Convert the number of portions into grams.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories the person can still consume.**

The person's daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and they have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many calories are in one portion of potato chips.**

Each portion of potato chips contains 250 calories.

**Step 3: Calculate how many portions the person can consume with the remaining calories.**

To find out how many portions can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ portions} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of portions into grams.**

Since one portion is 300 grams, 0.8 portions would be:
\[ 0.8 \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the person can still eat 240 grams of potato chips.

The final answer is:

mgsm-es-44,"To determine Charlie's net gain, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials and supplies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the 20 velas.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net gain.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials and supplies.**

Charlie needs 10 pounds of beeswax to make 10 vases. For 20 vases, he will need:
\[ 20 \text{ vases} \div 10 \text{ vases/libra} = 2 \text{ libras} \]

The cost of 2 libras of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \text{ libras} \times \$10,000 \text{ per libra} = \$20,000 \]

The cost of the wicks is:
\[ \$10,000 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ \$20,000 + \$10,000 = \$30,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the 20 vases.**

Charlie sells each vane for $20. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 vases is:
\[ 20 \text{ vases} \times \$20 \text{ per vane} = \$400 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the net gain.**

The net gain is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$400 - \$30,000 = -\$29,600 \]

Thus, Charlie's net gain is:

1. Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.
2. Determine the total number of hours spent on writing those articles.
3. Sum the hours to get the total.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote each day:

- **Lunes (Monday):** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Martes (Tuesday):** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Miércoles (Wednesday):** She wrote double the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing the articles is:
\[
26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent on the articles over the three days is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104
mgsm-es-46,"Let's denote the number of notes adhesives Candice bought as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 notes adhesives. After buying \( x \) more, she had \( 80 + x \) notes adhesives.

According to the problem, she had 23 notes adhesives left in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

Adding 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of notes adhesives in the paquete that Candice bought is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163
mgsm-es-94,"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of rabbits as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of dogs, \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

Now, substitute the values of \( D \) and \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. \]

The total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is the sum of the dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348. \]

Thus, the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\).",348,348

1. Calculate the number of girls in the 5th grade.
2. Determine the number of girls who are in the group of girls explorers.
3. Subtract the number of girls in the group of girls explorers from the total number of girls to find the number of girls who are not in the group of girls explorers.

First, let's find the number of girls in the 5th grade. We know that 2/5 of the 200 students are girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the group of girls explorers. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the group of girls explorers:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the group of girls explorers} = \frac{2}{3} \times 80 = \frac{160}{3} = 53.\overline{3} \approx 53.33
\]
Since the number of girls must be a whole number, we round 53.33 to 53 (assuming the problem implies rounding to the nearest whole number).

Now, we subtract the number of girls in the group of girls explorers from the total number of girls to find the number of girls who are not in the group of girls explorers:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the group of girls explorers} = 80 - 53 = 27

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]
So, James slept for 6 hours.

Next, we find out how many more hours Harry slept than James by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

mgsm-es-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used:**
   Freda prepared 32 ounces of salsa. Since the tomatoes lose half of their volume when prepared, the original volume of the tomatoes must be twice the volume of the salsa.
   \[
   \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tomatoes:**
   Each lata of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. Since Freda used 64 ounces of tomatoes, we can find the number of lata used by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of tomatoes per lata.
   \[
   \text{Number of lata} = \frac{64}{16} = 4
   \]
   Each lata contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) autos passed.
- In the next 15 minutes, 20 more autos passed.
- 5 autos left the highway to avoid the traffic jam.

The total number of autos initially on the highway was 30. After the 30-minute period, the number of autos remaining on the highway is the initial number minus the number that passed and minus the number that left.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ 30 - (x + 20 + 5) = \text{number of autos remaining} \]

Since the number of autos remaining on the highway is the number that passed minus the 5 that left, we can simplify the equation to:
\[ 30 - (x + 25) = \text{number of autos remaining} \]

Since the number of autos remaining is the number that passed minus the 5 that left, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the number of autos that passed in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{5} \).",5,5

First, we calculate the total number of plant pots Mary currently has. She has 2 plant pots in each of the 40 windowsills, so:
\[ 2 \text{ plant pots/window sill} \times 40 \text{ window sills} = 80 \text{ plant pots} \]

Next, we calculate how many plant pots she will give away. She will give away 1 plant pot from each of the 40 window sills, so:
\[ 1 \text{ plant pot/window sill} \times 40 \text{ window sills} = 40 \text{ plant pots} \]

Now, we subtract the number of plant pots given away from the total number of plant pots she currently has:
\[ 80 \text{ plant pots} - 40 \text{ plant pots} = 40 \text{ plant pots} \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots Mary will have left is:

mgsm-es-107,"Let's break down the time Frankie spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so 2 hours in total.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
- Friday: 2 hours.
- Let's denote the time spent watching TV on Wednesday as \( x \) hours.

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2 + 1.5 + 2 + x = 7 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 5.5 + x = 7 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ x = 7 - 5.5 \]
\[ x = 1.5 \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we divide \( x \) by 0.5 to find the number of 30-minute episodes:

\[ \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3 \]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday. The final answer is:

mgsm-es-108,"Let's denote the number of galletas Henry wanted to make this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry actually made \( 2x \) galletas, but he made 15 more than he wanted, so:
\[ 2x = x + 15 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x - x = 15 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, Henry wanted to make 15 galletas this year. Now, we need to determine how many galletas Henry made last year. Since he made 15 galletas this year, and he made 15 more than he wanted, last year he made:
\[ x - 15 = 15 - 15 = 0 \]

However, we need to account for the 5 galletas he discarded and the 110 galletas he ended up with. Let's denote the number of galletas Henry made last year as \( y \). After discarding 5 galletas, he had 110 galletas left:
\[ y - 5 = 110 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 110 + 5 \]
\[ y = 115 \]

Thus, Henry made 115 galletas last year. The final number is:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any discounts.
2. Calculate the total amount of the reintegro for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total reintegro from the total cost of the gas.

First, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the total reintegro for 10 gallons of gas is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total reintegro from the total cost of the gas:
\[ 30.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 28.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the gas after the reintegro is $28.00. The final answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of rollitos Beatrice ate.
2. Calculate the total number of rollitos Marcel ate.
3. Find the average of the total rollitos eaten by both.

First, let's calculate the total number of rollitos Beatrice ate. Beatrice was a bit off by 2 rollitos in width and 24 rollitos in length. Therefore, she ate 24 rollitos in length and 26 rollitos in width (since she was 2 rollitos short in width). The total number of rollitos Beatrice ate is:
\[ 24 + 26 = 50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of rollitos Marcel ate. Marcel was a bit off by 3 rollitos in width and 14 rollitos in length. Therefore, he ate 14 rollitos in length and 17 rollitos in width (since he was 3 rollitos short in width). The total number of rollitos Marcel ate is:
\[ 14 + 17 = 31 \]

Now, we find the average number of rollitos eaten by both Marcel and Beatrice. The average is the sum of the total rollitos eaten by both divided by 2:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{50 + 31}{2} = \frac{81}{2} = 40.5 \]

Therefore, the average number of rollitos eaten by Marcel and Beatrice is \(\boxed{40.5}\).",5,45
mgsm-es-111,"To determine how much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the speed of Julia's rowing.
2. Determine how much water entered the boat while Julia was rowing.
3. Calculate the initial amount of water in the boat.

**Step 1: Calculate the speed of Julia's rowing.**

Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet/second} \]

**Step 2: Determine how much water entered the boat while Julia was rowing.**

The boat had a leak that allowed 2 liters of water to enter for every 10 feet rowed. Julia rowed 20 feet, so the amount of water that entered is:
\[ \text{Water entered} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the initial amount of water in the boat.**

The distance to the shore is 64 seconds. Since Julia's speed is \(\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet/second}\), the distance to the shore is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

The boat had a leak that allowed 2 liters of water to enter for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the total amount of water that entered the boat while Julia was rowing 80 feet is:
\[ \text{Total water entered} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Since 4 liters of water entered while rowing 20 feet, the remaining water that entered while rowing the remaining 60 feet is:
\[ \text{Remaining water entered} = 16 \text{ liters} - 4 \text{ liters} = 12 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water in the boat is the total amount of water that entered minus the water that entered while rowing 20 feet:
\[ \text{Initial amount of water} = 16 \text{ liters} - 4 \text{ liters} = 12 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the initial amount of water in the boat is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]",12,16

From the problem, we know:
1. Jamal's phone can store 1800 photographs, so \( J = 1800 \).
2. Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so \( J = 6B \).
3. The number of photographs Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of aves in the photograph Jamal took, so \( B = 50P \).

First, we substitute \( J = 1800 \) into the equation \( J = 6B \):
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the value of \( B \) to find \( P \):
\[ B = 50P \]
\[ 300 = 50P \]
Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood:
Each piece costs $10, so for 10 pieces, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood:
Each piece costs $16, so for 5 pieces, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the wood combined:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the problem does not specify the selling price per piece or the total number of pieces, we assume that Sasha sells all the wood at the original price. Therefore, if she sells all the wood, she will earn the total cost of the wood, which is $180.

Thus, the amount Sasha can earn by selling all the wood is:

mgsm-es-116,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of cucharaditas of sugar and cups of water used by Katy, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of sugar and water together is \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

Katy used a total of 120 parts (cucharaditas of sugar and cups of water combined). Since the total parts correspond to 20 parts in the ratio, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total parts by 20:

\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

Now, to find the number of cucharaditas of sugar used, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts of sugar in the ratio:

First, John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Next, each pair of shoes costs $60. So, the total cost for 6 pairs of shoes is:

Given:
- Adrien's initial salary \( A = 40000 \).
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's initial salary.

From the information, we can write:
\[ A = L + 0.3L \]
\[ A = 1.3L \]

Substituting \( A = 40000 \):
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

After four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A \]

Given:
- The total number of cartas is 60.
- Jennie places stamps on a third of the cartas that need stamps.
- After placing stamps, there are 30 cartas with stamps.

First, we know that the total number of cartas is the sum of those needing stamps and those already having stamps:
\[ N + S = 60 \]

After placing stamps on a third of the cartas that need stamps, the number of cartas with stamps becomes:
\[ S + \frac{1}{3}N = 30 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( N + S = 60 \)
2. \( S + \frac{1}{3}N = 30 \)

Let's solve the second equation for \( S \):
\[ S + \frac{1}{3}N = 30 \]
\[ S = 30 - \frac{1}{3}N \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ N + (30 - \frac{1}{3}N) = 60 \]
\[ N + 30 - \frac{1}{3}N = 60 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}N + 30 = 60 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}N = 30 \]
\[ N = 30 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ N = 45 \]

Now, substitute \( N = 45 \) back into the first equation to find \( S \):

First, let's calculate the number of boletos used by Pam:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Pam rode the sled 2 times.
The cost for each ride is 6 boletos.

So, the total number of boletos Pam used is:
\[ 2 \text{ (roller coaster)} + 2 \text{ (sled)} = 4 \text{ rides} \]
\[ 4 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ boletos per ride} = 24 \text{ boletos} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of boletos used by Fred:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Fred rode the sled 2 times.
The cost for each ride is 6 boletos.

So, the total number of boletos Fred used is:
\[ 4 \text{ (roller coaster)} + 2 \text{ (sled)} = 6 \text{ rides} \]
\[ 6 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ boletos per ride} = 36 \text{ boletos} \]

- There are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
- Therefore, the total hours spent on these days in one week is \(3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\).

Next, let's calculate the hours spent on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each on these days.
- There are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday, Thursday).
- Therefore, the total hours spent on these days in one week is \(2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\).

Now, let's find the total hours spent in classes in one week:

mgsm-es-157,"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each ran, we need to calculate the total distance each ran.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake ran:
- Blake runs from one end of the field to the other 15 times.
- The field is 100 yards long.
- Therefore, the total distance Blake ran is:
  \[
  15 \times 100 = 1500 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly ran:
- Kelly runs from one end of the field to the 40-yard line and back to the 10-yard line.
- The distance from one end to the 40-yard line is 40 yards.
- The distance from the 40-yard line to the 10-yard line is 30 yards.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly ran in one round trip is:
  \[
  40 + 30 = 70 \text{ yards}
  \]
- Kelly does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly ran is:
  \[
  34 \times 70 = 2380 \text{ yards}
  \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake ran 1500 yards.
- Kelly ran 2380 yards.

The difference in the distances they ran is:
\[
2380 - 1500 = 880 \text{ yards}

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish Anakin caught:
- Anakin caught 10 estrellas de mar.
- Anakin caught 6 caballitos de mar.
- Anakin caught 3 peces payaso.

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish Locsin caught:
- Locsin caught 5 estrellas de mar less than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) estrellas de mar.
- Locsin caught 3 caballitos de mar less than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) caballitos de mar.
- Locsin caught 2 peces payaso more than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) peces payaso.

Now, we sum up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
- Anakin caught \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.

mgsm-es-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial price of the bag of marbles.
   The initial price is $20.

2. Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months.
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

3. Calculate the price after each two-month period. The price increases by 20% each period, which means the price is multiplied by \(1.20\) after each period.
   The price after \(n\) periods can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
   \[
   \text{Price after } n \text{ periods} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.20)^n
   \]
   Here, \(n = 18\), so the price after 36 months is:
   \[

mgsm-es-164,"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires a tax preparer, we need to compare the total income from both options. Let's denote Jackie's hourly wage as \( w \).

### Option 1: Liquidating Taxes Alone
- Jackie works for \( t \) hours.
- Her total income from working \( t \) hours is \( w \cdot t \).
- If she liquidates her taxes alone, she works \( t - 3 \) hours.
- Her total income from working \( t - 3 \) hours is \( w \cdot (t - 3) \).
- Her income is reduced by $35 per hour, so her income is \( w \cdot (t - 3) - 35 \cdot (t - 3) \).

### Option 2: Hiring a Tax Preparer
- The tax preparer charges $90.
- Her total income from working \( t - 3 \) hours is \( w \cdot (t - 3) \).
- Her total income after hiring the tax preparer is \( w \cdot (t - 3) - 90 \).

To find out how much more money Jackie will have by hiring the tax preparer, we need to calculate the difference in their incomes:
\[ \text{Difference} = \left( w \cdot (t - 3) - 90 \right) - \left( w \cdot (t - 3) - 35 \cdot (t - 3) \right) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = w \cdot (t - 3) - 90 - w \cdot (t - 3) + 35 \cdot (t - 3) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 35 \cdot (t - 3) - 90 \]

We need to express \( t \) in terms of \( w \). Since the problem does not provide specific values for \( w \) and \( t \), we assume \( t \) is such that the difference is maximized. However, the problem does not require the exact value of \( t \), only the difference in income.

Given the structure of the problem, we can simplify the expression:
\[ \text{Difference} = 35 \cdot (t - 3) - 90 \]

To find the numerical value, we need to assume a reasonable value for \( t \). Let's assume \( t = 10 \) hours (a common working day):
\[ \text{Difference} = 35 \cdot (10 - 3) - 90 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 35 \cdot 7 - 90 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 245 - 90 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 155 \]

Thus, Jackie will have \(\boxed{155}\) more dollars if she hires a tax preparer.",155,15

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
B = 8

3. Use the given information to find the cost of the limons.

First, let's find the total revenue from selling the limonade. They sell 20 vases per galón at $0.50 each, so the revenue per galón is:
\[ 20 \text{ vases/galón} \times \$0.50/\text{vase} = \$10/\text{galón} \]

Next, let's denote the number of galones sold as \( x \). The total revenue from selling \( x \) galones is:
\[ \$10x \]

The total cost of producing \( x \) galones is the cost of the limons and the sugar. The cost of the limons per galón is $3, and the cost of the sugar per galón is $2, so the total cost per galón is:
\[ \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{galón} \]
Thus, the total cost for \( x \) galones is:
\[ \$5x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the profit is $25, so we can write the equation:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the losing candidate received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winning candidate received:
\[
\text{Votes for the losing candidate} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the losing candidate received is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
mgsm-es-181,"Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( x \).

According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink orchids, which are 5 times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 200 = 5x \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]
So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Next, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]
So, Sandra ordered 160 red roses.

Sandra also ordered 200 pink orchids, which are 5 times the number of white carnations, and she ordered 40 white carnations. Therefore, the total number of flowers ordered is:
\[ 200 \text{ (pink orchids)} + 40 \text{ (white carnations)} + 160 \text{ (red roses)} = 360 \text{ flowers} \]

Since Sandra's total order was 360 flowers and she has already received 200 pink orchids and 40 white carnations, the number of flowers she still needs is:
\[ 360 - 200 - 40 = 120 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 120 red roses before 5 p. m. to satisfy Sandra's order.

mgsm-es-182,"To determine Jean's age, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine Mark's age:**
   - We know Jan is 30 years old.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - Let Mark's current age be \(M\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was \(M - 2\) years old.
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - So, \(M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5\).
   - Simplify the right side: \(M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19\).
   - Therefore, \(M = 19 + 2 = 21\).
   - Mark is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is 2 years older than Mark.
   - So, Jean's age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

Thus, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old.",23,23
mgsm-es-183,"To determine by how many seconds the faster team will win the race, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 400 meters relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each of the four team members runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for the faster team is:
  \[
  4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for the slower team is:
  \[
  60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}

mgsm-es-184,"To determine which event is more probable, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is:
\[
P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to compare the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 0.25. The difference in probability is:
\[
0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, it is 25% more probable that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 than that he will roll two consecutive even numbers. The final answer is:
\[

Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, so:
\[ J = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

The total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is the sum of the apples each picked:

Therefore, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-es-186,"Let's denote the number of rats in each of the 3 jaulas as \( r \). Since the rats are in groups of equal size, let's assume there are \( g \) groups of rats. Therefore, the total number of rats is \( 3g \).

Each rat gets 6 pieces of hay, so the total number of pieces of hay given to the rats is \( 6 \times 3g = 18g \).

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of hay given to the hamsters is 100. Each hamster gets 5 pieces of hay, so the total number of hamsters is \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \).

The total number of pieces of hay given to the rabbits is 20.

The total number of pieces of hay given to all the animals is 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18g + 100 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18g + 120 = 160 \]
\[ 18g = 40 \]
\[ g = \frac{40}{18} = \frac{20}{9} \]

Since \( g \) must be an integer, we need to check if our initial assumption about the number of groups is correct. Given that the total number of pieces of hay is 160 and the number of hamsters and rabbits is fixed, we can directly calculate the number of rats.

The total number of pieces of hay given to the rats is 18g, and we know this is 140 (since 160 total - 100 for hamsters - 20 for rabbits = 40 for rats):
\[ 18g = 140 \]
\[ g = \frac{140}{18} = \frac{70}{9} \]

Since \( g \) must be an integer, we need to recheck the problem constraints. Given the problem setup, the only consistent integer solution is:
\[ g = 7 \]
So, the total number of rats is \( 3g = 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Therefore, the number of rats in each jaula is:
\[ r = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]

The number of rats in each jaula is \(\boxed{7}\).",7,5

1. Calculate the total time John spends on each dog per day.
2. Calculate the total time John spends on all dogs per day.
3. Calculate the total time John spends on all dogs per week.

First, we know that John spends 0.5 hours per day per dog. Since he has 10 dogs, the total time spent per day on all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends on all dogs in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent per week is:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts can be bought with the available money.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets bought.

First, we calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts can be bought with 60 yogurts. Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5, we divide the total number of yogurts by 4:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his Lego toys.
2. Determine the total cost of the video games he buys.
3. Use the information about the remaining money to find out how many Lego toys he initially had.
4. Subtract the number of Lego toys he sold from the initial number to find out how many he has left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. John sells 13 Lego toys at $15 each.
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling Lego toys} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. John buys 8 video games at $20 each and has $5 left over.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since he has $5 left after buying the video games, the money he has left is $5. This means the money he spent on video games is $160, and the money he has left is $5, but the total money he had initially is $195 (from selling the Lego toys). So, the money he spent on video games is $160, and the money he has left is $5, which confirms the calculation.

3. Now, we need to find out how many Lego toys John initially had. Since he sold 13 Lego toys and the money he had initially was $195, we can confirm that he initially had 13 Lego toys.

4. Since he sold all 13 Lego toys, the number of Lego toys he has left is:

polymath-low-es-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to first find out how many miles he runs each day. Let's denote the number of hours John runs on the other two days as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- John runs a total of 60 miles per week.
- He runs 3 days a week.
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for \( x \) hours each day.
- The total running time over the three days is \( 3 + x + x = 3 + 2x \) hours.
- The distance run on the first day is \( 3 \times v \) miles, where \( v \) is his speed in miles per hour.
- The distance run on each of the other two days is \( x \times v \) miles.

The total distance run in a week is the sum of the distances run each day:
\[ 3v + 2(xv) = 60 \]
\[ 3v + 2vx = 60 \]
\[ v(3 + 2x) = 60 \]
\[ v = \frac{60}{3 + 2x} \]

To find the value of \( x \), we need to consider that the total running time must be consistent with the total distance. However, the problem does not provide additional constraints to determine \( x \) directly. Instead, we can assume a reasonable value for \( x \) that makes the equation simple and solvable. Let's assume \( x = 2 \) (this is a common assumption in such problems to simplify calculations).

If \( x = 2 \):
\[ v = \frac{60}{3 + 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{60}{3 + 4} = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, John's running speed is:
\[ v = \frac{60}{7} \text{ miles per hour} \]

polymath-low-es-39,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on the information given, and then calculate how far she can run and walk in the specified time.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   Dana can jump at 3 miles per hour. Since her jumping speed is half of her running speed, we can find her running speed as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Jumping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   Dana spends a third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. If she runs for \( t \) hours, she walks for \( \frac{2}{3}t \) hours. The total time is 6 hours, so:
   \[
   t + \frac{2}{3}t = 6
   \]
   To solve for \( t \):
   \[
   \frac{3}{3}t + \frac{2}{3}t = 6 \implies \frac{5}{3}t = 6 \implies t = 6 \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{18}{5} = 3.6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Therefore, she runs for 3.6 hours and walks for:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3.6 = 2.4 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance covered running and walking:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Running time} = 6 \times 3.6 = 21.6 \text{ miles}

   - Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Walking time} = 3 \times 2.4 = 7.2 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance covered:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 21.6 + 7.2 = 28.8 \text{ miles}

1. Calculate the total cost of materials and supplies for making 20 velas.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 velas.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of materials and supplies.**

- Each vela is made from 0.1 pounds of beeswax (since 10 velas are made from 1 pound of beeswax).
- Therefore, for 20 velas, the total amount of beeswax needed is \(20 \times 0.1 = 2\) pounds.
- The cost of 1 pound of beeswax is $10,00, so the cost for 2 pounds is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- The cost of the wicks (pabilos) for 20 velas is \(20 \times 1 = 20\) dollars (since 1 vela requires 1 vela).
- Therefore, the total cost is \(20 + 20 = 40\) dollars.

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 velas.**

- Each vela is sold for $2, so the revenue from selling 20 velas is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

- Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is \(40 - 40 = 0\) dollars.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote each day:

- On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday.
- On Wednesday, she wrote double the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles on Wednesday.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing the articles is:

polymath-low-es-48,"To determine how many 6-inch (or 18/3 = 1.5 feet) pieces Tracy can get from a 4-foot (or 48/12 = 4 feet) piece of wire, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.

First, we convert the length of the wire to the same units as the piece length. Since the wire is 4 feet long and each piece is 6 inches (which is 1/2 foot), we can calculate the number of pieces as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pieces} = \frac{\text{Total length of the wire}}{\text{Length of each piece}} = \frac{4 \text{ feet}}{1.5 \text{ feet}} = \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{4 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67
\]

Since Tracy can only cut whole pieces of wire, we take the integer part of the division, which is 2. To confirm, we can check the length of the wire used:

\[
2 \times 1.5 = 3 \text{ feet}
\]

This means Tracy can cut 2 pieces of 1.5 feet each, and the remaining length of the wire is:

\[
4 - 3 = 1 \text{ foot}
\]

Since 1 foot is less than 1.5 feet, Tracy cannot cut another piece. Therefore, the number of pieces Tracy obtained is:

\[

   \]

2. Calculate the total number of floors:
   \[
   \text{Total floors} = 15

polymath-low-es-54,"Let's denote the number of gatitos adopted by the sisters as \( x \).

According to the problem, Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of gatitos adopted. Therefore, the number of gatitos Patchy has is \( 3x \).

Trixie, the second cat, has had 12 gatitos.

The total number of gatitos in the family Doubtfire is the sum of the gatitos adopted and the gatitos born to the cats. Thus, the total number of gatitos is:
\[ x + 3x + 12 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 4x + 12 \]

Since the problem does not provide the specific number of gatitos adopted (\( x \)), we assume the question is asking for the expression in terms of \( x \). However, if we assume the problem intends to find a specific numerical answer, we need to consider the context that \( x \) must be a value that makes the expression a whole number. Given the problem's structure, we can infer \( x \) should be a value that fits the context.

If we assume the simplest case where \( x = 0 \) (though not explicitly stated, this is a common assumption in such problems for simplicity), then:

According to the problem, each floor has half the area of the floor above it. We are given that the fourth floor has an area of 16 square feet.

First, we can express the areas of the floors in terms of the fourth floor's area:
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area of the four floors is the sum of the areas of each floor:
\[ A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average area of one floor, we divide the total area by the number of floors:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average area of one floor is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60

1. **Calculate the food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia needs 1 taza of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total food for 180 days = \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ taza/day} = 180 \text{ tazas} \).

2. **Calculate the food needed for the remaining days of her life:**
   - After the first 180 days, Cecilia will need 2 tazas of dog food per day for the rest of the dog's life.
   - The dog will live for \( 365 - 180 = 185 \) days after the first 180 days.
   - Total food for the remaining 185 days = \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ tazas/day} = 370 \text{ tazas} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of food needed for the entire period:**
   - Total food needed = food for the first 180 days + food for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total food needed = \( 180 \text{ tazas} + 370 \text{ tazas} = 550 \text{ tazas} \).

4. **Calculate the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 tazas of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{550 \text{ tazas}}{110 \text{ tazas/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use during the first year is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

2. Use Sarah's laundry amount to find out how much Raymond does.
3. Use Sarah's laundry amount to find out how much David does.
4. Calculate the difference between the laundry done by Raymond and David.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find out how much David does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4:
\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find out how much Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2:

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in 3-flower ramos:
- Each 3-flower ram contains 3 flowers and costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) ramos.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15.00\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in 2-flower ramos:
- Each 2-flower ram contains 2 flowers and costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) ramos.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(9 \times 1.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in 2-flower ramos is $9.00.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in 3-flower ramos is $15.00.

The savings by buying 18 flowers in 2-flower ramos instead of 3-flower ramos is:

2. Determine the total cost before the discount.
3. Apply the 10% discount to find the final amount paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jean needs the maquillaje for.**

Jean needs a maquillaje that takes 6 hours each time, and he needs it 4 times a week for 5 weeks.

Total hours = 6 hours/time * 4 times/week * 5 weeks

\[
\text{Total hours} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ hours}

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour

\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 120 \times 250 = $30000
\]

**Step 3: Apply the 10% discount to find the final amount paid.**

The discount is 10%, so the amount paid is 90% of the total cost.

Discounted amount = 90% of $30000

Cost of the house: $80,000
Cost of renovations: $50,000

Total cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Next, we know that the total cost increased by 150% to become the selling price. Let's denote the selling price as \( S \).

Given that the increase is 150%, the total cost represents 250% of the selling price (100% original + 150% increase). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 130,000 = \frac{250}{100} \times S \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ 130,000 = 2.5 \times S \]
\[ S = \frac{130,000}{2.5} \]
\[ S = 52,000 \]

The selling price of the house is $52,000.

To find the gain, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:

\[ \text{Gain} = S - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \text{Gain} = 52,000 - 130,000 \]
\[ \text{Gain} = -78,000 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates a loss rather than a gain. The amount of loss is $78,000.

polymath-low-es-6,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, and then find the total number of sheep in all three cities.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - We know that Charleston has 4 times more sheep than Seattle.
   - Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Given that Charleston has 80 sheep, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sheep in all three cities:**
   - We sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
     \[
     \text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} + \text{Number of sheep in Seattle}

polymath-low-es-7,"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into manageable parts.

1. **Calculate the time without interruptions:**
   Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so the time to download 200 GB without interruptions is:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Identify the time spent downloading and the time spent restarting:**
   The download is interrupted 40% of the time, which means it is uninterrupted 60% of the time. The uninterrupted part of the download is 60% of the total download time. The time spent downloading without interruptions is:
   \[
   0.6 \times 100 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   The time spent downloading during interruptions is:
   \[
   0.4 \times 100 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   However, during the interruptions, there is a 20-minute delay for the restart. So, the total time spent on interruptions (including the restart delay) is 40 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time including the restart delay:**
   The total time spent downloading the file, including the restart delay, is the sum of the time spent downloading without interruptions and the time spent downloading during interruptions (including the restart delay):
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total time Carla spends downloading the file is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,160

1. **First Segment (3 hours at 60 mph):**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Second Segment (2 hours in traffic):**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 0 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 0 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Third Segment (30 mph for 0.5 hours):**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Fourth Segment (80 mph for 1.5 hours):**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles}

polymath-low-es-9,"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week when she worked 45 hours, we need to break down her pay into two parts: the pay for the first 40 hours and the pay for the additional hours worked beyond 40.

1. Calculate the pay for the first 40 hours:
   The pay rate for the first 40 hours is $10 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Pay for first 40 hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the pay for the additional 5 hours (since she worked 45 hours in total):
   The pay rate for overtime (hours worked beyond 40) is 1.2 times the regular pay rate.
   \[
   \text{Pay rate for overtime} = 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 1.2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pay for 5 overtime hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars}

polymath-low-es-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to maintain the tree each year is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost = \(10.5 - 93 = -82.5\) dollars.

Since the net profit is negative each year, Carlos will never start making a profit from the lemon tree. The tree will always incur a loss.

polymath-low-es-13,"Let's denote the initial number of aspiradoras Melanie had as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her aspiradoras in the house green, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) aspiradoras.
2. She then sold 2 more aspiradoras in the house red.
3. After these sales, the number of aspiradoras left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \). This simplifies to \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She then sold half of the remaining aspiradoras in the house orange, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
5. After selling these, the number of aspiradoras left is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). This simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
6. According to the problem, after these sales, Melanie has 5 aspiradoras left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
7. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
8. Next, we add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12

   \[
   2x = 36

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5000
   - Expected increase: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = $5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = $5000 \times 1.025 = $5125

2. **Electronic Devices:**
   - Initial value: $8000
   - Expected increase: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic devices = $8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = $8000 \times 1.012 = $8096

Next, we calculate the gain for each option:
- Gain from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Initial value of jewelry = $5125 - $5000 = $125
- Gain from electronic devices = Future value of electronic devices - Initial value of electronic devices = $8096 - $8000 = $96

Comparing the gains:
- Gain from jewelry: $125

- She works 50 weeks per year as a teacher.

The weekly earnings as a teacher are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 700 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The annual earnings as a teacher are:

polymath-low-es-19,"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we start by calculating the total time she has already spent walking and the total distance she has already covered.

Marissa has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in 1 hour

So, the total distance she has already walked is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance of the hike is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. The average speed is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. Let \( t \) be the time she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total time for the entire hike will be \( t + 1 + 1 = t + 2 \) hours. The average speed is given by:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{12}{t + 2} \]

We want this average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{12}{t + 2} = 4 \]

To solve for \( t \), we multiply both sides by \( t + 2 \):
\[ 12 = 4(t + 2) \]
\[ 12 = 4t + 8 \]
\[ 12 - 8 = 4t \]
\[ 4 = 4t \]
\[ t = 1 \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour. Therefore, her speed for the remaining distance is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining distance is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,6

3. Determine the amount of water in the 9 liters of mixed refresco after the spill.
4. Sum the amounts of water from the orange juice and the mixed refresco to get the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed refresco.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange juice.**

The orange juice contains \(\frac{2}{3}\) water. Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange juice is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple juice.**

The pineapple juice contains \(\frac{3}{5}\) water. Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple juice is:

**Step 3: Determine the amount of water in the 9 liters of mixed refresco after the spill.**

When 1 liter of orange juice is spilled, the remaining 9 liters of mixed refresco will have the same ratio of water and juice as the original 10 liters of orange juice. The ratio of water to the total mixture in the original 10 liters is \(\frac{2}{3}\). Therefore, the amount of water in the 9 liters of mixed refresco is:

3. Calculate how many ice cream boxes she will need.
4. Compute the total cost based on the number of boxes needed.

Step 1: Number of nights in 60 days
Cynthia comes for ice cream every night, so in 60 days, there are 60 nights.

Step 2: Number of porciones of ice cream
Cynthia consumes 1 porción of ice cream each night. Therefore, in 60 nights, she will consume:

2. He made his first stop after traveling 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the journey.

First, we calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the journey:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end, we can find the distance from the first stop to the second stop by subtracting 15 miles from 40 miles:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:

We know that the cost of one pair of high-heeled shoes is $33, and the other is double that cost, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104
polymath-low-es-30,"Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, the age of Allen within 10 years is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109

First, let's determine the number of caramels each friend estimates:
1. The first friend estimates there are 80 caramels.
2. The second friend estimates there are 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's estimate} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend estimates there are 25% more than the first friend's estimate:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's estimate} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Next, we calculate the average of these estimates:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

1. Calculate the amount of water each of the two girls received.
2. Calculate the total amount of water received by the two girls.
3. Determine the amount of water the child received.
4. Subtract the total amount of water received by the girls and the child from the original amount of water.

First, we calculate the amount of water each girl received. Since each girl received \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the 24 liters of water:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]
Since there are two girls, the total amount of water received by the two girls is:

polymath-low-es-84,"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost. This gives us the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can substitute this value back into the second equation to find \( W \):
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games. The final answer is:

polymath-low-es-86,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many times Greg's alarm rang in total today.

1. **First Activation:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Activation:**
   - The alarm rang 3 times more than the first time.
   - Therefore, the second activation rang \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) times.

3. **Third Activation:**
   - The alarm rang half as many times as the second time.
   - Therefore, the third activation rang \( \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \) times.

Since the alarm can only ring whole numbers of times, we need to consider the context. Typically, alarms are designed to ring whole numbers of times. Given the problem's context, we assume the third activation also rings 3.5 times, which we can interpret as 3 times and a half, meaning it rings 3 times and then stops ringing for the rest of the day.

Now, let's sum up the total number of times the alarm rang:
- First activation: 4 times
- Second activation: 7 times
- Third activation: 3 times

Adding these together:

First, we know that 1/4 of the invited guests do not arrive. Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who do not arrive is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]
This means that the number of guests who will receive a gift bag is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Next, we need to find out how many gift bags are required. According to the problem, Christina needs 0.75 bags per guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats \( C \) is two times the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D \).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the sum of the number of dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, substitute the value of \( D \) into the equation for \( C \):

Next, substitute the values of \( D \) and \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168. \]

Now, we can find the total number of domestic animals by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

2. Determine the number of girls who are in the group of girls explorers.
3. Subtract the number of girls in the group of girls explorers from the total number of girls to find the number of girls who are not in the group of girls explorers.

First, we calculate the number of girls in the 5th grade. Since 2/5 of the 200 students are girls, we have:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the group of girls explorers. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the group of girls explorers, we have:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the group of girls explorers} = \frac{2}{3} \times 80 = \frac{160}{3} = 53.\overline{3} \approx 53 \text{ (since we typically deal with whole numbers in such contexts)}

Initially, there were 30 autos on the highway. After 15 minutes, the number of autos left on the highway is \( 30 - x - 5 \) (since 5 autos took a different route). These remaining autos, along with the 20 that passed in the last 15 minutes, make up the total number of autos that passed through the embotellment.

So, the equation representing the total number of autos that passed through the embotellment is:

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 of the number of times the first friend rang the doorbell. Therefore, the second friend rang the doorbell \(20 \times \frac{1}{4} = 5\) times.
3. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend rang the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend rang the doorbell:

1. Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.
2. Determine the number of days Solo has left to read.
3. Calculate the average number of pages Solo must read per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
\[
4 \text{ (science)} + 20 \text{ (social studies)} + 7 \text{ (history)} + 8 \text{ (geography)} = 39 \text{ pages}
\]

Next, we know Solo has already read 15 pages on the first day. Therefore, the number of pages left to read is:
\[
39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages}
\]

Solo has 4 days left to read the remaining pages. To find the average number of pages Solo must read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages/day}

polymath-low-es-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption pattern.

1. **Daily Water Intake:**
   - John drinks one glass of water with each meal: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - Therefore, his daily water intake is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) glasses.

2. **Weekly Water Intake (excluding weekends):**
   - John drinks water every day of the week except for the weekend.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - So, his weekly water intake from Monday to Friday is \(3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15\) glasses.

3. **Weekend Water Intake:**
   - On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks one glass of water with dinner.
   - Therefore, his weekend water intake is \(1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2\) glasses.

4. **Total Weekly Water Intake:**

3. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy's mother places.
4. Determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy's mother places her pieces.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Poppy places a fourth of the 1000 pieces:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:

Henry actually made \( 2y + 15 \) galletas, but he discarded 5 of them, leaving him with \( 2y + 15 - 5 = 2y + 10 \) galletas. We know that after discarding the 5 galletas, he has 110 galletas left. Thus, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2y + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( y \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 2y + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2y = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2y = 100 \]
\[ y = \frac{100}{2} \]

polymath-low-es-111,"To determine how much water was in Julia's boat when she reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she traveled and the amount of water that entered the boat during that time.

First, we know that Julia took 16 seconds to travel 20 feet. We need to find out how long it would take her to travel the full 64 feet to the shore.

Since 20 feet take 16 seconds, we can find the time to travel 1 foot:
\[ \text{Time per foot} = \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = 0.8 \text{ seconds per foot} \]

Now, we can calculate the time to travel 64 feet:
\[ \text{Time to 64 feet} = 64 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 \text{ seconds per foot} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water entered the boat during this time. We know that 2 liters of water enter the boat for every 10 feet traveled. Therefore, the rate of water entering the boat is:
\[ \text{Rate of water} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat during the 51.2 seconds:

2. Use the information about the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold to find out the number of photographs in the photograph of the ducks.
3. Use the number of photographs in the photograph to find out the number of ducks in the photograph.

First, let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \). According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can write the equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]
So, Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 300 photographs.

Next, let's denote the number of photographs in the photograph of the ducks as \( P \). The problem states that the number of photographs in the photograph is 50 times the number of ducks in the photograph. Let's denote the number of ducks in the photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have:
\[ P = 50D \]
We know from the problem that \( P = 1800 \). So, we can substitute 1800 for \( P \) in the equation:
\[ 1800 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{1800}{50} = 36 \]
So, the number of ducks in the photograph is 36.

polymath-low-es-115,"To determine how much Sasha can earn by selling the leftover wood, we need to calculate the total cost of the wood she has and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the wood:
- Sasha has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood, each costing $10. The total cost for these pieces is:
  \[
  10 \text{ pieces} \times \$10/\text{piece} = \$100
  \]
- Sasha also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood, each costing $16. The total cost for these pieces is:
  \[
  5 \text{ pieces} \times \$16/\text{piece} = \$80
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost of all the wood is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the wood:
- Sasha has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood. The total number of pieces she has is:
  \[
  10 + 5 = 15 \text{ pieces}
  \]
- If she sells each piece for the same price as the original cost (since the problem does not specify a different selling price), the total revenue is:
  \[
  15 \text{ pieces} \times \$10/\text{piece} = \$150
  \]

The amount Sasha earns by selling all the wood is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\$150 - \$180 = -\$30
\]

Since the result is negative, it means Sasha would lose $30 if she sells all the wood at the original cost. However, the problem asks for the amount she can earn, which in this case is a loss. Therefore, the answer is:

Given:
- Adrien's initial salary \( A = 40000 \).
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's initial salary, so \( A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).

From the above, we can solve for \( L \):
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]
