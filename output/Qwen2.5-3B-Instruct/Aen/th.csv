mgsm-th-47,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the red neckties and the blue neckties, and then sum them up.

First, let's find the price of the blue necktie:
- The blue necktie costs $200.

Next, we need to find the price of the red necktie. We know that the red necktie costs 50% more than the blue necktie:
- The cost of the red necktie = $200 + 50% of $200
- 50% of $200 = 0.5 * $200 = $100
- Therefore, the cost of the red necktie = $200 + $100 = $300

Now, we need to find out how many red neckties John bought. We know that he bought more red neckties than blue neckties by a factor of 2:
- Let the number of blue neckties be \( x \).
- The number of red neckties = \( 2x \).

Since the price per red necktie is $40, we can set up the equation for the total cost of the red neckties:
- Total cost of red neckties = \( 2x \times 40 \)

We also know the total cost of the blue neckties:
- Total cost of blue neckties = \( x \times 200 \)

The total amount John spent is the sum of the costs of the red and blue neckties:
- Total amount spent = \( 2x \times 40 + x \times 200 \)

Given that John spent a total of $600 on neckties, we can set up the equation:
- \( 2x \times 40 + x \times 200 = 600 \)
- \( 80x + 200x = 600 \)
- \( 280x = 600 \)
- \( x = \frac{600}{280} = \frac{30}{14} = \frac{15}{7} \approx 2.14 \)

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we need to recheck the problem constraints. Given the problem setup, it seems \( x = 2 \) is the closest integer solution:
- If \( x = 2 \), then the number of red neckties = \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

Now, we calculate the total cost:
- Total cost of blue neckties = \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \)
- Total cost of red neckties = \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \)
- Total amount spent = \( 400 + 160 = 560 \)

Therefore, the total amount John spent is:
\boxed{560}",560,800
mgsm-th-48,"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of the wire into the same unit as the wire segments. The length of the wire is given in feet, and the wire segments are given in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 4 feet to inches:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch segments can be cut from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each segment:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/segment} = 8 \text{ segments} \]

Therefore, the number of wire segments (or the number of separate pieces of wire) is:

mgsm-th-49,"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of units occupied.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of units that are not occupied.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units.
\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}

**Step 2: Determine the number of units occupied.**

According to the problem, 3/4 of the units are occupied.
\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of units that are not occupied.**

Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.
\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units}

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid in a week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are laid in a week.
3. Calculate the weekly income based on the price per dozen.

First, we know that the chickens lay 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs laid in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs this is. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Given that each dozen is sold for $2, the weekly income is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the weekly income from the eggs is $\\boxed{294}$.",294,294
mgsm-th-51,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total distance Tom traveled. He sailed for 3 hours (from 13:00 to 16:00) at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

So, Tom traveled 30 miles away from his starting point and then returned the same distance.

When he returns, his speed is 6 miles per hour. The distance he needs to cover to return to his starting point is also 30 miles.

Time to return = Distance / Speed
Time to return = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, the time Tom spent sailing back is $\\boxed{5}$.",5,5

mgsm-th-53,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the earnings for each day and then determine the difference in earnings between the days.

First, let's calculate the earnings for Thursday:
- For the 6 truck tires, the earnings are $60 \times 6 = 360$ dollars.
- For the 4 car tires, the earnings are $40 \times 4 = 160$ dollars.
- Total earnings for Thursday: $360 + 160 = 520$ dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings for Friday:
- For the 12 car tires, the earnings are $40 \times 12 = 480$ dollars.
- For the truck tires, the earnings are $60 \times 0 = 0$ dollars.
- Total earnings for Friday: $480 + 0 = 480$ dollars.

Now, we compare the earnings of Thursday and Friday:
- Earnings on Thursday: $520$ dollars.

mgsm-th-54,"Let's denote the number of kittens that Pat chick (the first cat) gave birth to as P. According to the problem, the number of kittens that Trixie (the second cat) gave birth to is 12. The problem also states that the number of kittens Pat chick gave birth to is three times the number of kittens the family already had.

Let's denote the number of kittens the family already had as K. Therefore, we can write the equation for Pat chick's kittens as:
\[ P = 3K \]

For Trixie's kittens, the equation is:
\[ 12 = K \]

Now, substituting the value of K from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ P = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, Pat chick gave birth to 36 kittens. Adding these to the 12 kittens from Trixie, the total number of kittens is:

mgsm-th-57,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds.

Given:
- Each box weighs 15 pounds.
- The total weight of the truck and its empty load is 3755 pounds.
- The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds.

First, we need to find out how much weight the truck can carry after accounting for its own weight and the empty load weight.

Total weight the truck can carry = Maximum bridge weight limit - Total weight of the truck and its empty load
= 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds
= 1245 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding the remaining weight capacity.

Let \( x \) be the number of boxes. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight of the boxes is \( 15x \) pounds.

We need to solve for \( x \) in the inequality:
\[ 15x \leq 1245 \]

Divide both sides by 15:

The number of unripe tangerines can be found by subtracting the number of rotten and sour tangerines from the total number of tangerines:
25 - 1 - 2 = 22 unripe tangerines.

Next, we know that 20% of the tangerines are unripe. Let's verify this:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \text{ unripe tangerines} \]

Since the count of unripe tangerines is 22, which is more than the expected 5 based on the percentage, it indicates that the given percentages might not be directly related to the number of unripe tangerines. However, we will use the given information.

Now, we know the number of sour tangerines is 2. The remaining tangerines are sweet and delicious. To find the number of sweet and delicious tangerines, we subtract the number of unripe, sour, and rotten tangerines from the total number of tangerines:

Given:
- Annual pension amount = $50,000
- Annual interest rate = 5%
- Number of years before retirement = 30

The formula for the future value of an annuity (FV) is given by:

\[ FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the annual payment ($50,000)
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (5% or 0.05)
- \( n \) is the number of years (30)

Plugging in the values:

\[ FV = 50000 \times \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{30} - 1}{0.05} \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.05)^{30} \):

\[ (1 + 0.05)^{30} \approx 4.3219 \]

Then, substitute back into the formula:

\[ FV = 50000 \times \frac{4.3219 - 1}{0.05} \]

- Rose: $2.74 per plant
- Petunia: $1.87 per plant
- Begonia: $2.12 per plant

First, we calculate the total cost for each type of flower:
- Total cost for roses: \(12 \times 2.74 = 32.88\) dollars
- Total cost for petunias: \(9 \times 1.87 = 16.83\) dollars
- Total cost for begonias: \(17 \times 2.12 = 35.94\) dollars

Next, we sum these amounts to get the total cost before rounding:
\[32.88 + 16.83 + 35.94 = 85.65\] dollars

Since Arty rounds down the price of each flower, we need to determine the effect of rounding down on the total cost. The rounding down means each flower is sold at the next lower price that is a whole number. We need to find the closest whole numbers to each of the prices:
- Rose: $2.74 rounds down to $2
- Petunia: $1.87 rounds down to $1
- Begonia: $2.12 rounds down to $2

Now, we calculate the total cost after rounding down:
- Total cost for roses: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars
- Total cost for petunias: \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars
- Total cost for begonias: \(17 \times 2 = 34\) dollars

Adding these amounts gives the total cost after rounding down:
\[24 + 9 + 34 = 67\] dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Arty will receive after rounding down is $\\boxed{67}$.",67,88
mgsm-th-75,"To find the average area of each layer, we first need to determine the area of each layer based on the given information.

Given:
- The top layer (4th layer) has an area of 16 square feet.
- Each subsequent layer has an area that is half of the layer below it.

Let's denote the area of the 4th layer as \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet.

For the 3rd layer (\( A_3 \)):
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

For the 2nd layer (\( A_2 \)):
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]

For the 1st layer (\( A_1 \)):
\[ A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we have the areas of all four layers:
- 1st layer: 128 square feet
- 2nd layer: 64 square feet
- 3rd layer: 32 square feet
- 4th layer: 16 square feet

To find the average area of the four layers, we sum the areas and divide by 4:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the average area of each layer is 60 square feet.

1. Calculate the amount of food needed for the first 180 days:
   - Celia needs to feed the dog 1 cup per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total food needed for 180 days = 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.

2. Calculate the amount of food needed for the remaining 180 days of the year:
   - Celia needs to feed the dog 2 cups per day for the remaining 180 days.

2. Sara washes more than David 4 times: \( S > 4D \)
3. Sara washes 400 pounds of laundry: \( S = 400 \) pounds

First, we substitute \( S = 400 \) into the second relationship:
\[ 400 > 4D \]
\[ D < 100 \]

Next, we substitute \( S = 400 \) into the first relationship:
\[ R < \frac{400}{2} \]
\[ R < 200 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymonde and David wash. Since we don't have a specific value for \( R \), we can only express the difference in terms of \( R \) and \( D \). The maximum value \( R \) can take is 199 pounds (since \( R < 200 \)), and the minimum value \( D \) can take is 1 pound (since \( D > 0 \)).

The maximum possible difference between Raymonde and David's laundry is:

mgsm-th-78,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of buying 18 roses at the cheaper price and compare it to the cost at the more expensive price.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 roses at the cheaper price:
- The cheaper price is $1 per 2 roses.
- To find out how many groups of 2 roses are in 18 roses, we divide 18 by 2: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
- Therefore, the total cost at the cheaper price is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 roses at the more expensive price:
- The more expensive price is $2.50 per 3 roses.
- To find out how many groups of 3 roses are in 18 roses, we divide 18 by 3: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
- Therefore, the total cost at the more expensive price is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two prices:

1. **Calculate the total number of roses:** 
   - The number of roses per plant is 3.
   - The number of plants is not specified, but we can denote it as \( n \).
   - Therefore, the total number of roses is \( 3n \).

2. **Calculate the total number of thorns per rose:**
   - Each rose has 25 flowers.
   - Each flower has 8 thorns.
   - Therefore, the number of thorns per rose is \( 25 \times 8 = 200 \).

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire cards
- 20 grass cards
- 40 water cards

After losing 8 water cards and gaining 14 grass cards, the new counts are:
- Fire cards: 30
- Grass cards: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water cards: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

The probability of drawing a water card is the number of water cards divided by the total number of cards:

Calinda can assemble 4 pieces per minute.

Her mother can assemble twice as many pieces per minute as Calinda, which means her mother can assemble \(2 \times 4 = 8\) pieces per minute.

Now, let's find out how many pieces they can assemble together in one minute:
\[ 4 \text{ (Calinda's rate)} + 8 \text{ (mother's rate)} = 12 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

The total number of pieces is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take for them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{12 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ O > \frac{1}{2}A \]

Since A = 50, we substitute this value into the inequality:

\[ O > \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \]
\[ O > 25 \]

This means the number of other insects is more than 25. To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of other insects:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Clare uses in one week.
2. Multiply the weekly egg usage by the number of weeks (4 weeks).

First, let's find out how many eggs Clare uses in one week. Since she makes an omelet with 3 eggs each morning, and she does this every day of the week, we calculate the weekly egg usage as follows:

\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she will use in 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Eggs in 4 weeks} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many egg cartons she will need. Assuming each egg carton holds 12 eggs, we calculate the number of cartons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/carton}} = 7 \text{ cartons} \]

Therefore, Clare will use 7 egg cartons in 4 weeks.

1. Marris has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours.
2. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
3. To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12 miles, the total time she needs to walk the trail is 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.
4. Since she has already walked for 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

2. Calculate the amount of water in the 15-liter pineapple juice:
   - Water in pineapple juice = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

3. Calculate the total amount of water before mixing:
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters.

4. After removing 1 liter of the mixed drink, the total volume of the drink is reduced to 24 liters. Since 1 liter of the drink is removed, the amount of water removed is the proportion of water in that 1 liter:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend guessed more than 40. The second friend's guess is therefore more than 40, but we don't have an exact number.
3. The third friend guessed more than the first friend by 25% of the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend guessed more than 80 + 20 = 100. The third friend's guess is therefore more than 100.

Based on the above, we can summarize the guesses as follows:
- The first friend guessed 80.
- The second friend guessed more than 40.
- The third friend guessed more than 100.

Since we need to find the average of these guesses, we can use the minimum possible values for the second and third friends' guesses, which are just above 40 and 100 respectively. However, for the purpose of finding the average, we can use the smallest possible values that satisfy the conditions, which are 41 and 101.

The average of 80, 41, and 101 is calculated as follows:

3. Sohan has fewer gems than Aaron by 2.

First, let's calculate half of what Raymonde has:
Half of 40 = 40 / 2 = 20

Since Aaron has more gems than this amount, Aaron has more than 20 gems.

Let's denote the number of gems Aaron has as A. According to the problem, A > 20.

Now, we know Sohan has 2 fewer gems than Aaron:
So, if Aaron has A gems, Sohan has A - 2 gems.

The problem does not provide the exact number of gems Aaron has, but it tells us Sohan has 2 fewer than Aaron. We can use the information about Raymonde to find Sohan's gems indirectly.

Since Raymonde has 40 gems and Aaron has more than half of that, Aaron must have more than 20 gems. However, we need to find Sohan's gems directly.

Given that Sohan has 2 fewer gems than Aaron, and we know Aaron has more than 20 gems, the minimum number of gems Aaron could have is 21 (since it must be more than 20).

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times \$20/\text{game} = \$160 \]

Now, we determine the total amount of money John spent:
\[ \$160 \text{ (cost of video games)} + \$195 \text{ (money from selling Lego sets)} = \$355 \]

Since John has $5 left after all the transactions, we can find out how much money he spent in total:
\[ \$355 \text{ (total spent)} - \$5 \text{ (money left)} = \$350 \]

Finally, we calculate how many Lego sets John sold:
\[ \frac{\$350}{\$15/\text{set}} = \frac{350}{15} = 23.\overline{3} \]

Since John can only sell whole Lego sets, he sold 23 sets. Therefore, the number of Lego sets he has left is:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} - 23 \text{ sets} = -10 \]

However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of sets, we conclude that John sold all his Lego sets and still needed more money to buy the video games. Thus, he has 0 Lego sets left.

- Sheets used for coffee cups: 220
- Sheets remaining: 23

The total number of post-it notes she had initially and used is:
\[ 80 + 220 = 300 \]

Now, we know that after using 300 sheets, she has 23 sheets left. Therefore, the total number of post-it notes she had before using any is:

mgsm-th-94,"Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

From the problem, we know:
1. D + C > 12R
2. C = 2D
3. D = 60

Substituting D = 60 into C = 2D, we get C = 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, we substitute D and C into the first inequality:
60 + 120 > 12R
180 > 12R
15 > R

So, R must be less than 15. The number of rabbits R can be any integer from 0 to 14.

The total number of animals is:
D + C + R = 60 + 120 + R = 180 + R

Since R can be any integer from 0 to 14, the total number of animals will be between 180 and 194.

Therefore, the total number of animals in the neighborhood is $\\boxed{180 \text{ to } 194}$.",194,348

- Fraction of boys = \(\frac{2}{5}\)

Number of boys = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80\)

Next, we find the number of girls:
- Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
- Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we calculate the number of girls who are not in school (become nun):
- Fraction of girls who become nun = \(\frac{2}{3}\)

Number of girls who become nun = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80\)

Thus, the number of girls who are not in school (become nun) is 80.

   - The final sauce has a volume of 32 ounces.

2. **Understand the volume reduction factor:**
   - The tomatoes reduce in volume by half when making the sauce.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Calculation: \( 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \).

3. **Determine the total volume of tomatoes available:**
   - Each tomato can be used twice (as described in the problem).
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Each can has a total volume of 16 ounces.
   - Therefore, the total volume of tomatoes in one can is 16 ounces.

Initially, there were 30 cars on the highway. After the first 15 minutes, the number of cars on the highway would be \( 30 - x \) (since \( x \) cars moved during this time).

In the last 15 minutes, 20 cars moved, and 5 cars used the exit lane, which means \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) cars moved through the congested traffic.

Therefore, the total number of cars that moved through the congested traffic is \( x + 15 \).

Since the total number of cars initially was 30, and after the first 15 minutes, the number of cars on the highway is \( 30 - x \), we have:

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the wood. Since the problem does not specify the selling price per unit of wood, we assume the selling price is the same as the original purchase price (as no price increase is mentioned for the wood itself, only for the value of the wood).

- Selling price for 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood:

Given:
- Adrian's initial salary \( A = 40,000 \)
- Adrian's salary increased by 30% after the first four years.
- Adrian's salary increased by 40% after another four years.
- Adrian's salary four years later is 40% more than his salary four years before.

First, calculate Adrian's salary after the first four years:
\[ A_{4} = A + 0.30A = 1.30A = 1.30 \times 40,000 = 52,000 \]

Next, calculate Adrian's salary after another four years:
\[ A_{8} = A_{4} + 0.40A_{4} = 1.40A_{4} = 1.40 \times 52,000 = 72,800 \]

Now, we need to find Lila's initial salary. Since Adrian's salary increased by 30% after the first four years, we can express Lila's salary in terms of Adrian's salary:
\[ L_{4} = \frac{A_{4}}{1.30} = \frac{52,000}{1.30} = 40,000 \]

After another four years, Lila's salary increased by 40%:
\[ L_{8} = L_{4} + 0.40L_{4} = 1.40L_{4} = 1.40 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \]

Finally, the total salary of both Adrian and Lila four years later:
\[ \text{Total salary} = A_{8} + L_{8} = 72,800 + 56,000 = 128,800 \]

Therefore, the total salary of both Adrian and Lila four years later is $\\boxed{128800}$.",128800,95200

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, each patient is seen for \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours per visit.

The hospital charges $200 per hour per patient:
- Revenue per patient = \( 0.4 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \text{ dollars} \).

With 500 patients per day:
- Total revenue = \( 500 \text{ patients} \times 80 \text{ dollars/patient} = 40000 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
- Each doctor charges $150 per hour.
- Each patient is seen for 0.4 hours.
- Therefore, the cost per patient = \( 0.4 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars} \).

With 500 patients per day:
- Total cost = \( 500 \text{ patients} \times 60 \text{ dollars/patient} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, the profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = \( 40000 \text{ dollars} - 30000 \text{ dollars} = 10000 \text{ dollars} \).

mgsm-th-147,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 worker bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees half of the 30 worker bees (i.e., 15 bees) return to the hive.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees twice as many worker bees leave the hive as she saw leave in the first 6 hours, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) bees.

Now, let's determine how many bees are in the hive at the start of the last 6-hour period. Initially, there are 30 bees leaving and 15 returning, so the net loss is \(30 - 15 = 15\) bees. Therefore, the number of bees in the hive at the start of the last 6 hours is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

During the last 6 hours, all the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours return to the hive. Additionally, the 15 bees that left in the second 6 hours and did not return yet also return to the hive. Thus, the total number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, Debra sees 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

mgsm-th-150,"To determine who wins the race and how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to travel from school to their respective homes.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet

For Steve:
- Distance to home: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute

Time for Steve to reach his home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = \frac{15840}{440} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
- Distance to home: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute

Time for Tim to reach his home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = \frac{10560}{264} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Tim takes longer to reach his home, he is the loser. Steve wins the race and will wait for Tim for:

mgsm-th-174,"To determine the total time Billie will spend preparing the potatoes, we need to calculate the time spent on peeling and slicing each potato, and then multiply by the number of potatoes.

1. Time spent peeling one potato: 15 seconds
2. Time spent slicing one potato: 5 seconds

Total time to prepare one potato:
\[ 15 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (slicing)} = 20 \text{ seconds} \]

Billie has 60 potatoes to prepare. Therefore, the total time required to prepare all 60 potatoes is:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 20 \text{ seconds per potato} = 1200 \text{ seconds} \]

Convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 1200 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Billie will spend preparing the potatoes is:

The cost to buy \( x \) gallons of limes is:
\[ 3x \text{ dollars} \]

The cost to buy \( 20x \) cups of sugar (since they sell 20 cups per gallon) is:
\[ 2 \times 20x = 40x \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost is:
\[ 3x + 40x = 43x \text{ dollars} \]

They sell each glass for $0.50, so the revenue from selling \( 20x \) glasses is:
\[ 0.50 \times 20x = 10x \text{ dollars} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10x - 43x = 25 \]
\[ -33x = 25 \]
\[ x = \frac{25}{-33} \]
\[ x = -\frac{25}{33} \]

Since the negative sign indicates a mistake in interpretation (likely due to a misinterpretation of the problem setup), we should consider the positive value:
\[ x = \frac{25}{33} \]

However, since we are dealing with whole gallons, we need to re-evaluate the problem context. Given the profit is $25, and the setup seems correct, the number of gallons they bought is:
\[ x = 1 \]

Thus, the number of gallons they bought is \(\boxed{1}\).",1,15

\[ R = 36 + 10 \]
\[ R = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of clams Rani, Monique, and Bobby have:

   According to the problem, the number of red roses ordered is four times the number of white carnations, so it is \( 4x \).

3. **Determine the number of pink lilies ordered:**
   The number of pink lilies ordered is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations, so it is \( 5x \).

4. **Calculate the total number of flowers ordered:**
   The total number of flowers ordered is the sum of the white carnations, red roses, and pink lilies:
   \[

5. **Determine the number of red roses missing:**
   The problem states that the number of red roses ordered is four times the number of white carnations, so:
   \[
   4x

   Since the total number of flowers ordered is \( 5x + 200 \), and the number of red roses ordered is \( 4x \), the number of red roses missing is:
   \[
   4x - (5x + 200 - 4x) = 4x - x - 200 = 3x - 200

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   We need to find \( x \) such that the missing red roses can be delivered by 17:00. Since the problem does not provide a specific time for delivery of the missing red roses, we assume all other flowers are delivered on time. Therefore, the missing red roses must be delivered by 17:00.

   Given that the total number of flowers ordered is \( 5x + 200 \), and the number of red roses ordered is \( 4x \), the number of red roses missing is \( 3x - 200 \). For the missing red roses to be delivered by 17:00, we need:
   \[
   3x - 200 = 4x - 4x = 0
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   3x - 200 = 0 \implies 3x = 200 \implies x = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67

First, let's determine the probability of getting a number greater than 3. Since the die has 6 sides, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's determine the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is:
\[ P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how much greater the probability of getting a number greater than 3 is compared to the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers. We do this by subtracting the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers from the probability of getting a number greater than 3:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Therefore, the probability of getting a number greater than 3 is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$ greater than the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers.",4,25

First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money John spends on video games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times \$20 \text{ per game} = \$160 \]

Now, let's determine how much money John has after selling his Lego sets and buying the video games:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Since he has $5 left after these transactions, we can confirm that:
\[ \$35 + \$5 = \$40 \]

This $40 is the total amount of money he had initially. Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he has left:
\[ \text{Total money} = \$40 \]
\[ \text{Money spent on video games} = \$160 \]
\[ \text{Money left} = \$5 \]

So, the number of Lego sets he has left is:
\[ \boxed{13 - \frac{160 - 5}{15}} = \boxed{13 - \frac{155}{15}} = \boxed{13 - 10.33} = \boxed{2.67} \]

However, since the number of Lego sets must be a whole number, we need to recheck the problem constraints. Given the problem setup, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. Let's recheck the transactions:

John starts with $40 and spends $160 on video games, leaving him with $5. This means he must have started with more money initially, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:

\[ \text{Lego sets left} = 13 - \frac{160 - 5}{15} = 13 - 10.33 = 2.67 \]

Since the number of Lego sets must be a whole number, we conclude that John has 2 Lego sets left.

- On the second and third days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours. Therefore, the distance covered on each of these days is \( 1.5v \) miles.

Now, let's find the total distance John runs in a week:
- Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day + Distance on the third day
- Total distance = \( 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v \) miles

Next, we calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
- Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day + Time on the third day
- Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

Now, we can find John's average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = \( \frac{6v}{6} = v \) miles per hour

Given that the total distance is 60 miles, we can find \( v \) by solving:

polymath-low-th-45,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then calculate the total time spent writing.

1. Let the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday be \( A \).
2. According to the problem, she wrote 5 articles on Monday.
3. On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
   \[
   A + \frac{2}{5}A = \frac{7}{5}A
   \]
   Substituting \( A = 5 \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{5} \times 5 = 7
   \]
   So, she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.
4. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
A + \frac{7}{5}A + 14 = 5 + \frac{7}{5} \times 5 + 14 = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26

So, she wrote a total of 26 articles over the three days.

5. Each article takes 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total time spent writing is:
   \[
   26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}

1. Initially, Candice had 80 sheets of post-it notes.
2. She bought an additional pack of post-it notes.
3. She used 220 sheets to stick them on coffee cups during her work.
4. After using these, she had 23 sheets left.

To find out the total number of post-it notes she had before using any, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial sheets} + \text{Additional sheets} = \text{Used sheets} + \text{Remaining sheets} \]

Let's denote the number of additional sheets as \( x \). Then the equation becomes:

\[ 80 + x = 220 + 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x = 243 \]
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, Candice bought 163 additional sheets of post-it notes.

Now, to find the total number of post-it notes she had initially and after buying the additional pack:

\[ 80 + 163 = 243 \]

Therefore, the total number of post-it notes she had is \(\boxed{243}\).",243,163
polymath-low-th-47,"First, let's find the price of the red necktie. Since the red necktie is $50\%$ more expensive than the blue one, and the blue necktie costs $40$ dollars, we calculate the price of the red necktie as follows:

Price of red necktie = Price of blue necktie + 50% of Price of blue necktie
Price of red necktie = $40 + 0.5 \times 40$
Price of red necktie = $40 + 20$
Price of red necktie = $60$ dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the neckties. John bought two red neckties and one blue necktie, so the total cost is:

Total cost = (Number of red neckties \times Price of red necktie) + (Number of blue neckties \times Price of blue necktie)
Total cost = (2 \times 60) + (1 \times 200)
Total cost = $120 + 200$

First, let's calculate the total for each type of flower:

1. **Flowers of Lilies (Lilium):
   - Price per flower: $2.74
   - Number of flowers: 12
   - Total for lilies: \( 12 \times 2.74 = 32.88 \) dollars

2. **Flowers of Peonies (Paeonia):
   - Price per flower: $1.87
   - Number of flowers: 9
   - Total for peonies: \( 9 \times 1.87 = 16.83 \) dollars

3. **Flowers of Begonias (Begonia):
   - Price per flower: $2.12
   - Number of flowers: 17
   - Total for begonias: \( 17 \times 2.12 = 35.94 \) dollars

Now, we sum up the totals for all the flowers:
\[ 32.88 + 16.83 + 35.94 = 85.65 \]

Therefore, Arty will receive a total of 85.65 dollars.

Given:
- The top layer (4th layer) has an area of 16 square feet.

We can work backwards to find the areas of the other layers:
- The area of the 3rd layer is twice the area of the top layer: \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) square feet.
- The area of the 2nd layer is twice the area of the 3rd layer: \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) square feet.
- The area of the bottom layer (1st layer) is twice the area of the 2nd layer: \( 2 \times 64 = 128 \) square feet.

Now, we have the areas of all four layers: \( 128, 64, 32, \) and \( 16 \) square feet.

To find the average area of the four layers, we sum these areas and divide by 4:
\[
\text{Average area} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60

Therefore, the average area of each layer is \(\boxed{60}\) square feet.",60,60
polymath-low-th-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of food required for the first 180 days and then for the remaining days of the year.

First, calculate the food needed for the first 180 days:
- For the first 180 days, the dog needs 1 cup of food per day.
- Therefore, the total food needed for 180 days is \(180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

Next, calculate the food needed for the remaining 180 days of the year:
- For the remaining 180 days, the dog needs 2 cups of food per day.
- Therefore, the total food needed for the remaining 180 days is \(180 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 360 \text{ cups}\).

Now, add the food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 180 days to find the total food needed for the first year:
- Total food needed for the first year = \(180 \text{ cups} + 360 \text{ cups} = 540 \text{ cups}\).

Given that one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required for 540 cups:
- Number of bags needed = \(\frac{540 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{540}{110} = \frac{54}{11} \approx 4.91\).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 5.

Therefore, the number of bags Cecilia will need in the first year is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

From the problem, we know:
1. Raymonde washes less than half of what Sara washes: \( R < \frac{1}{2}S \)
2. Sara washes 4 times as much as David: \( S = 4D \)

We are given that Sara washes 400 pounds of laundry, so:
\[ S = 400 \]

Using the second piece of information, we can find the amount David washes:
\[ D = \frac{S}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

Now, using the first piece of information, we can find the amount Raymonde washes:
\[ R < \frac{1}{2}S = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \]

So, Raymonde washes less than 200 pounds of laundry. To find the difference between what Raymonde and David wash, we need to consider the maximum possible value for Raymonde, which is just under 200 pounds. For the purpose of calculating the difference, we can use 199 pounds as an upper bound for Raymonde's laundry:

\[ \text{Difference} = R - D < 199 - 100 = 99 \]

Therefore, the maximum possible difference is 99 pounds. Enclosing the final number:

Given:
- Tank 1 has 4 crabs.

- The difference in the number of crabs between the two tanks is twice the total number of crabs in both tanks.

First, let's calculate the total number of crabs in both tanks:
\[ 4 + 32 = 36 \]

According to the problem, the difference in the number of crabs between the two tanks is twice the total number of crabs:
\[ |4 - 32| = 2 \times 36 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 28 = 72 \]

This equation does not hold true, which indicates there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. However, let's assume the problem meant to say the difference in the number of crabs is twice the total number of crabs in one tank (since the number of fish in each tank is the same).

Let's reframe the problem:
- The difference in the number of crabs between the two tanks is twice the number of crabs in one tank.

Let's denote the number of crabs in Tank 1 as \( a \) and in Tank 2 as \( b \). We know:
\[ a = 4 \]
\[ b = 32 \]

The difference between the number of crabs in the two tanks is:
\[ |a - b| = |4 - 32| = 28 \]

According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times a \]

Solving for \( a \):
\[ 28 = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 28 = 8 \]

This is incorrect. Let's assume the problem meant the difference is twice the number of crabs in one tank:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 28 = 8 \]

This is still incorrect. Let's assume the problem meant the difference is twice the number of crabs in one tank:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 28 = 8 \]

Since the number of fish in each tank is the same, let's denote the number of fish in each tank as \( x \).

Given the total number of crabs is 36, and the difference is twice the number of crabs in one tank:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 28 = 8 \]

Since the number of fish in each tank is the same, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 28 = 2 \times 4 \]
\[ 28 = 8 \]

Since the number of fish in each tank is the same, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each tank is:

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles/hour} = 180 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours and 30 minutes = 2.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 75 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Clare uses in one week.
2. Multiply the weekly egg usage by the number of weeks (4 weeks).

First, let's calculate the number of eggs Clare uses in one week. Since she makes one omelet each day and each omelet uses 3 eggs, and she makes one omelet every day, we have:
\[ \text{Eggs per day} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
\[ \text{Eggs in 4 weeks} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many egg cartons (each containing 30 eggs) Clare will need for 84 eggs. We do this by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per carton:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/carton}} = 2.8 \]

polymath-low-th-19,"To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we need to calculate the total distance and the total time taken, and then use the desired average speed to find the required speed for the last part of the journey.

First, let's summarize the information given:
- Total distance: 12 miles
- Distance covered in the first 4 miles: 4 miles in 1 hour
- Distance covered in the next 2 miles: 2 miles in 1 hour
- Desired average speed: 4 miles per hour

Total distance covered so far: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Time taken so far: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Remaining distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles
Remaining time: Let's denote this time as \( t \) hours

The average speed for the entire journey should be 4 miles per hour. Therefore, the total distance divided by the total time should equal 4 miles per hour.

\[
\frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 + t \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
12 = 4 \times (2 + t)
\]

\[
12 = 8 + 4t
\]

\[
4t = 4
\]

\[
t = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, the total time taken for the entire journey is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, for the remaining 6 miles, the time taken is 1 hour. Therefore, the required speed for the last 6 miles is:

\[
\text{Required speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

Henry takes a break after completing 20 miles of the trip. This means the distance from the start to the first rest stop is 20 miles.

The second rest stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance is 60 miles, the distance from the start to the second rest stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance between the two rest stops, we subtract the distance to the first rest stop from the distance to the second rest stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the two rest stops is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25

The total price of the two high-heeled shoes is \( P_1 + P_2 = 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Given that the combined price of the two high-heeled shoes is $5 less than the price of the boot, the price of the boot \( P_b \) can be calculated as follows:

1. **First Friend's Guess:**
   - The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.

2. **Second Friend's Guess:**
   - The second friend guessed more than half of the first friend's guess.
   - Half of 80 is 40.
   - Therefore, the second friend's guess is more than 40, which means it is at least 41.
   - The second friend guessed 20 more than the first friend, so the second friend's guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

3. **Third Friend's Guess:**
   - The third friend guessed more than the first friend's guess by 25%.
   - 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the third friend's guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

4. **Average Guess:**
   - To find the average of the guesses, we sum the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.
   - The guesses are 80, 100, and 100.
   - Sum of the guesses: \(80 + 100 + 100 = 280\).

- Lee runs 400 meters 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
- Gerald's speed increases by 10% after dieting.

First, we calculate Lee's speed:
\[ L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \]

Since Lee runs 400 meters 2 seconds faster than Gerald:
\[ 38 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, Gerald's new speed after dieting is 10% faster:
\[ G_{\text{new}} = G \times 1.10 \]

Since Gerald's original time to run 400 meters is 40 seconds, we can find his original speed:
\[ G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second} \]

With the 10% increase in speed:
\[ G_{\text{new}} = 10 \text{ meters/second} \times 1.10 = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each tomato can be used in one batch of sauce.
   - Since each tomato's original volume is 64 ounces and the final volume after reduction is 32 ounces, each tomato is used once.
   - Each tomato can be used in one batch, and Freea made 2 batches (since 32 ounces per batch * 2 batches = 64 ounces of tomatoes).

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each batch uses 3 tomatoes.

According to the problem, Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amyeer. This can be written as:
\[ C = 3A \]

We are also given that Amyeer eats 5 cookies:
\[ A = 5 \]

Substituting the value of \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ C = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, to find the total number of cookies they both eat together, we add \( C \) and \( A \):

polymath-low-th-106,"To find the total internal volume of the three boxes, we need to first calculate the internal dimensions of one box and then find the volume. 

Given:
- External dimensions of each box: 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches
- Thickness of the box walls: 1 inch

First, we calculate the internal dimensions of one box:
- The internal length is the external length minus twice the thickness (since the thickness is on both sides): 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- The internal width is the external width minus twice the thickness: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- The internal height is the external height minus twice the thickness: 4 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the volume of one internal box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{internal length} \times \text{internal width} \times \text{internal height} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are three boxes, the total internal volume is:
\[ \text{Total internal volume} = 3 \times \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total internal volume of the three boxes is $\\boxed{72}$.",72,72
polymath-low-th-107,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 30-minute TV shows Franke watches on Wednesday, given that he watches TV for a total of 7 hours over the week.

First, let's convert the total TV watching time into minutes:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know the TV watching times for the other days of the week:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour per show, 1 show per night
- Wednesday: 30 minutes of 1-hour shows + 30 minutes of 30-minute shows
- Thursday: 1 hour of 1-hour shows + 30 minutes of 30-minute shows
- Friday: 2 shows of 1 hour each
- Saturday and Sunday: No specific information, but he can watch up to 7 hours in total, so we assume he watches the full 7 hours on these days.

Let's calculate the total TV time for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
- Monday and Tuesday: 
  \[ 1 \text{ hour/show} \times 2 \text{ shows} = 2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
- Thursday:
  \[ 1 \text{ hour/show} + 0.5 \text{ hour/show} = 1.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]
- Friday:
  \[ 2 \text{ shows} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these up:
\[ 120 + 120 + 90 + 120 = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, subtract this from the total TV time to find the time spent on Wednesday:
\[ 420 - 450 = -30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the calculation shows a negative value, it indicates an error in our assumptions or calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Given:
- Monday and Tuesday: 120 minutes
- Thursday: 90 minutes
- Friday: 120 minutes

Total for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 120 + 120 + 90 + 120 = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Total TV time:
\[ 420 \text{ minutes} \]

Difference:
\[ 420 - 450 = -30 \text{ minutes} \]

This discrepancy suggests a need to recheck the problem constraints. Given the problem setup, the correct interpretation should be:

Since the total TV time is 420 minutes and the other days sum to 450 minutes, the calculation indicates an error. Let's assume the problem constraints are correct and re-evaluate:

On Wednesday, let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute shows:
\[ 30x + 30 = 420 - 450 = -30 \]

This indicates an error in the problem setup. Given the constraints, the correct number of 30-minute shows on Wednesday is:
\[ x = 1 \]

Thus, the number of 30-minute shows Franke watches on Wednesday is:

polymath-low-th-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry made last year as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- This year, he made twice as many cookies as last year, so he made \( 2x \) cookies.
- He made 15 more cookies than he intended, so the actual number of cookies he made this year is \( 2x + 15 \).
- He dropped 5 cookies while arranging them, so the number of cookies he actually had is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
- We know that the number of cookies he actually had is 110.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry made \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year.",50,50
polymath-low-th-109,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline after applying the discount.

1. **Determine the original cost of 10 gallons:**

1. **Calculate the area of Beatrice's dried fruit:**
   - Beatrice's dried fruit has a width of 24 and a length of 24.
   - Area of Beatrice's dried fruit = width × length = 24 × 24 = 576.

2. **Calculate the area of Marcelle's dried fruit:**
   - Marcelle's dried fruit has a width of 3 and a length of 14.
   - Area of Marcelle's dried fruit = width × length = 3 × 14 = 42.

3. **Calculate the total area of all dried fruit:**
   - Total area = Area of Beatrice's dried fruit + Area of Marcelle's dried fruit = 576 + 42 = 618.

4. **Calculate the average area consumed by Marcelle and Beatrice:**
   - Total number of dried fruit pieces = Number of Beatrice's pieces + Number of Marcelle's pieces.
   - Since the problem does not specify the exact number of pieces, we assume they have the same number of pieces for simplicity.
   - Let's assume each has \( n \) pieces.
   - Total number of pieces = \( n + n = 2n \).
   - Average area consumed = Total area / Total number of pieces = 618 / 2n = 309 / n.

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of pieces, we assume they have the same number of pieces for simplicity. The average area consumed is 309 per piece.

Therefore, the average area consumed by Marcelle and Beatrice is \(\boxed{309}\).",309,45

1. **Determine the speed of the boat:**
   - Julia takes 10.6 seconds to travel 20 feet.
   - Speed = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 10.6 seconds ≈ 1.88 feet/second.

2. **Calculate the time to reach the shore:**
   - The distance to the shore is 64 seconds.
   - Time to reach the shore = 64 seconds.

3. **Determine the distance traveled in 64 seconds:**
   - Distance = Speed * Time = 1.88 feet/second * 64 seconds ≈ 120.32 feet.

4. **Calculate the depth of the lake:**
   - For every 10 feet traveled, 2 liters of water enter the boat.
   - Distance traveled = 120.32 feet.
   - Number of 10-foot segments = 120.32 / 10 ≈ 12.032.
   - Water volume = 12.032 * 2 liters ≈ 24.064 liters.

5. **Convert the volume to milliliters:**
   - 1 liter = 1000 milliliters.

2. Brittanee's phone can take 50 times more photos than the number of photos Jamal took of the ducks: \( B = 50J \).

We are given that Jamal can take 1,800 photos \( J = 1800 \).

First, substitute \( J = 1800 \) into the second equation to find \( B \):

\[ B = 50 \times 1800 = 90000 \]

Now, we know that Jamal took 1,800 photos. Let's denote the number of ducks Jamal took photos of as \( D \). According to the problem, \( J = 6B \), and since \( J = 1800 \), we can find \( D \):

\[ 1800 = 6D \]
\[ D = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Jamal took photos of 300 ducks. Since Brittanee's phone can take 50 times more photos than Jamal's photos of ducks, the number of ducks Brittanee can see in her photos is:

\[ 50 \times 300 = 15000 \]

Therefore, Jamal can see 300 ducks in her photos, and Brittanee can see 15000 ducks in her photos. The number of ducks Jamal can see is 300.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the wood:**
   - Cost of 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood: \(10 \times \$10 = \$100\)
   - Cost of 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood: \(5 \times \$16 = \$80\)
   - Total cost: \(\$100 + \$80 = \$180\)

2. **Calculate the total volume of wood:**
   - Volume of 1 piece of 2 x 4 x 10 wood: \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) cubic units
   - Volume of 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood: \(10 \times 80 = 800\) cubic units
   - Volume of 1 piece of 4 x 4 x 10 wood: \(4 \times 4 \times 10 = 160\) cubic units
   - Volume of 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood: \(5 \times 160 = 800\) cubic units
   - Total volume: \(800 + 800 = 1600\) cubic units

3. **Determine the selling price per cubic unit:**
   - Let's assume the price per cubic unit is \(P\).

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Total revenue: \(1600 \times P\)

5. **Calculate the profit:**

\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

It is also given that the sum of the teaspoons of sugar and the glasses of water is 120:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

From the ratio, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ S = \frac{7}{13}W \]

Substitute this expression for \( S \) into the equation \( S + W = 120 \):
\[ \frac{7}{13}W + W = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{7W + 13W}{13} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20W}{13} = 120 \]

Solve for \( W \):
\[ 20W = 120 \times 13 \]
\[ 20W = 1560 \]
\[ W = \frac{1560}{20} \]
\[ W = 78 \]

Now, substitute \( W = 78 \) back into the equation \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \):
\[ S = \frac{7}{13} \times 78 \]

- Four years ago, Adrian's salary was $40,000.
- Four years later, Adrian's salary is 40% more than it was four years ago.
- Both Adrian and Lila's salaries increased by the same percentage.

From the information, we know that four years ago:
\[ A = 40000 \]
\[ A = 1.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

Four years later, Adrian's salary is 40% more than $40,000:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Since both salaries increased by the same percentage, let's denote this percentage increase as \( x \). Thus, we have:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = A \times (1 + x) \]
\[ 56000 = 40000 \times (1 + x) \]
\[ 1 + x = \frac{56000}{40000} = 1.4 \]
\[ x = 0.4 \]

So, four years later, Lila's salary will be:
\[ L_{\text{new}} = L \times (1 + x) = \frac{400000}{13} \times 1.4 = \frac{560000}{13} \approx 43076.92 \]

The total salary of Adrian four years later is:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = 56000 \]

The total salary of Lila four years later is:
\[ L_{\text{new}} = \frac{560000}{13} \]
