mgsm-fr-52,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many jouets Uriah needs to remove in order to reduce his weight by 15 pounds, given that he removes 30 comic strips and each comic strip weighs 1/4 pound.

First, let's calculate the weight of the 30 comic strips:
\[
30 \text{ comic strips} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound per comic strip} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much weight is left to be reduced by removing jouets. The total weight reduction needed is 15 pounds, and 7.5 pounds has already been accounted for by removing the comic strips. Therefore, the remaining weight to be reduced by removing jouets is:
\[
15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each jouet weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound, so the number of jouets that need to be removed to reduce the weight by 7.5 pounds is:
\[
7.5 \text{ pounds} \div \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per jouet} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ jouets}
\]

Thus, the number of jouets Uriah needs to remove is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

mgsm-fr-54,"Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as \( x \). According to the problem, the first cat, Patchy, had three times the number of adopted kittens, so Patchy had \( 3x \) kittens. The second cat, Trixie, had 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie. Therefore, the total number of kittens is:
\[ x + 3x + 12 = 4x + 12 \]

We know from the problem that the family initially had 7 adopted kittens. Since the family now has all these kittens plus the kittens from Patchy and Trixie, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4x + 12 = 7 + 7 + 7 \]
\[ 4x + 12 = 21 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4x + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 4x = 21 - 12 \]
\[ 4x = 9 \]
\[ x = \frac{9}{4} \]
\[ x = 2.25 \]

Now, substituting \( x = 2.25 \) back into the expression for the total number of kittens:
\[ 4x + 12 = 4(2.25) + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Therefore, the family Doubtfire now has \(\boxed{21}\) kittens.",21,40

mgsm-fr-64,"To determine how many miles Sophie can drive with a single full tank of gas, we need to calculate the fuel efficiency of her car. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Sophie's car has a total capacity of 12 gallons of fuel.
2. She used 4 gallons to refill the tank, meaning she had 8 gallons left after her last trip.
3. She drove 100 miles with the 8 gallons of fuel.

To find the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon), we use the following calculation:

mgsm-fr-73,"To determine the monthly payment Shiela must make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the five telephones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest on the five telephones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of monthly payments.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of one telephone is $150. Therefore, the cost of five telephones is:
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Therefore, the total interest for five telephones is:
   \[
   5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The total amount to be paid is the sum of the total cost and the total interest:
   \[
   750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Since the payment is to be made in 3 monthly installments, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \frac{765}{3} = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount Shiela will need to pay each month is \(\boxed{255}\).",255,255

mgsm-fr-75,"To determine the average surface area of an individual sandcastle layer, we need to consider the relationship between the surface areas of consecutive layers and the given information.

Given:
- The surface area of the highest (4th) layer is 16 square feet.
- Each layer's surface area is half of the layer immediately below it.

Let's denote the surface area of the 4th layer as \( A_4 \), the 3rd layer as \( A_3 \), the 2nd layer as \( A_2 \), and the 1st layer as \( A_1 \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]

Since each layer's surface area is half of the layer immediately below it, we can express the areas of the other layers in terms of \( A_4 \):
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_4 \]
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times (2 \times A_4) = 4 \times A_4 \]
\[ A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times (4 \times A_4) = 8 \times A_4 \]

Now, substituting \( A_4 = 16 \):
\[ A_3 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_1 = 8 \times 16 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average surface area of the layers, we sum the areas of all four layers and divide by 4:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 60 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average surface area of an individual sandcastle layer is:

mgsm-fr-76,"To determine how many sacks of dog food Cécilia will use in the first 180 days, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of dog food required during this period and then convert that into sacks.

1. Calculate the number of bowls needed in the first 180 days:
   - During the first 180 days, Cécilia needs 1 bowl of dog food per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of bowls needed in 180 days is:
     \[
     180 \text{ bowls}
     \]

2. Calculate the number of bowls needed in the remaining days of her dog's life:
   - Since the dog's life is not specified, we assume the remaining days are the total days the dog lives minus the first 180 days.
   - However, the problem does not specify the total lifespan of the dog, so we only need to consider the first 180 days for the calculation.
   - Therefore, the number of bowls needed in the remaining days is 0.

3. Calculate the total number of bowls of dog food used in the first 180 days:
   - The total number of bowls used in the first 180 days is 180 bowls.

4. Convert the total number of bowls into sacks of dog food:
   - Each sack contains 110 bowls.
   - Therefore, the number of sacks needed is:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ bowls}}{110 \text{ bowls/sack}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \text{ sacks}

mgsm-fr-77,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry each person does and then find the difference between the amount Raymond does and the amount David does.

First, let's find out how much laundry Sara does. According to the problem, Sara does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we know that Sara does 4 times more laundry than David. Therefore, we can find out how much David does by dividing Sara's laundry by 4:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sara. Therefore, we can find out how much Raymond does by dividing Sara's laundry by 2:

mgsm-fr-84,"Let's denote the number of matches the team won as \( W \) and the number of matches the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of matches played is 22, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won \( x \) times more matches than it lost, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = xL \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = xL \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[ xL + L = 22 \]
\[ L(x + 1) = 22 \]
\[ L = \frac{22}{x + 1} \]

Since \( L \) must be a whole number, \( x + 1 \) must be a divisor of 22. The divisors of 22 are 1, 2, 11, and 22. Therefore, \( x + 1 \) can be 1, 2, 11, or 22. This gives us the possible values for \( x \) as 0, 1, 10, and 21. However, \( x \) cannot be 0 because the team must have lost some matches, so we discard \( x = 0 \). We also discard \( x = 21 \) because it would imply \( L = 1 \) and \( W = 22 \), which would mean the team won 21 times more than it lost, but the total matches played would be 22, which is not possible since the team would have played 22 matches in total (21 wins and 1 loss).

So, we are left with \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 10 \).

If \( x = 1 \), then \( L = \frac{22}{1 + 1} = 11 \) and \( W = 11 \times 1 = 11 \). This gives us 11 wins and 11 losses, which sums to 22 matches.

If \( x = 10 \), then \( L = \frac{22}{10 + 1} = 2 \) and \( W = 2 \times 10 = 20 \). This gives us 20 wins and 2 losses, which sums to 22 matches.

Both solutions are valid, but the problem does not specify which one to choose, so we can present either solution. For the sake of a single answer, we can choose the simpler case where \( x = 1 \), which gives us 11 wins.

Therefore, the number of times the team won is \(\boxed{11}\).",11,15

Now, let's sum up the total time the alarm sounded throughout the day:
\[ x + 3x + \frac{3x}{2} \]

To add these terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ x + 3x + \frac{3x}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{6x}{2} + \frac{3x}{2} = \frac{2x + 6x + 3x}{2} = \frac{11x}{2} \]

We know that the first time the alarm sounded was 4 minutes, so:
\[ x = 4 \]

Substituting \( x = 4 \) into the total time equation:

Tom plants 10 trees and abats 2 trees each year. The net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.**

Tom starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, the number of trees increases by 8 trees each year. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.**

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]
So, the number of trees remaining after the 30% die is:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\).",91,91
mgsm-fr-193,"To determine the number of flamants roses in Sue's garden at noon on Sunday, and to find how many more there were than the number of white ones, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Placement (Friday):**
   Sue starts with 18 flamants roses in her garden.

2. **Saturday's Action:**
   On Saturday, the neighbors take one-third of the 18 flamants roses and paint them white, then place them back in the garden. 
   - One-third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - Thus, 6 flamants roses are painted white and placed back in the garden.

3. **Remaining Flamants Roses:**
   After the white ones are placed, the number of flamants roses left in the garden is:
   \[
   18 - 6 = 12
   \]

4. **Sunday's Action:**
   On Sunday, the neighbors add 18 more flamants roses to the garden.
   - The total number of flamants roses in the garden now is:
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30
     \]

5. **Counting the White Flamants Roses:**
   - Initially, 6 flamants roses were painted white.
   - No additional white flamants roses were added on Sunday.

6. **Comparing the Numbers:**
   - Total number of flamants roses: 30
   - Total number of white flamants roses: 6
   - The difference between the total number of flamants roses and white flamants roses is:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24
     \]

Thus, there were 24 more flamants roses than white ones in Sue's garden at noon on Sunday. The final answer is:

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons Violetta wants to buy.
2. Determine how many crayons she can buy with her $20.
3. Calculate the amount of money she will have left after the purchase.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars/crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayons she can buy with her $20. Since each crayon costs $2, the number of crayons she can buy is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/crayon}} = 10 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we calculate the amount of money she will have left after the purchase. Since she spends $10 on crayons, the amount of money she will have left is:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Violetta will have left is:

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed.
2. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be received by the restaurants.
3. Subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available to find the unused amount.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed. Since each of the 40 restaurants will receive 2 books of carrots, the total distribution is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ books/restaurant} = 80 \text{ books} \]

Next, we know that the total amount of carrots available is 200 books. The amount of carrots that will not be used is the difference between the total amount available and the total amount distributed:
\[ 200 \text{ books} - 80 \text{ books} = 120 \text{ books} \]

Therefore, the number of books of carrots that will not be used is:

mgsm-fr-199,"To determine how much Marc earns in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of phrases Marc edits for each editor:**
   - Marc edits a total of 1000 phrases per week.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of phrases Marc edits for the editeur A.
   - Since Marc edits the same number of phrases for both editors, he also edits \( x \) phrases for the editeur B.
   - Therefore, \( x + x = 1000 \), which simplifies to \( 2x = 1000 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 500 \).
   - So, Marc edits 500 phrases for the editeur A and 500 phrases for the editeur B.

2. **Determine the payment rates:**
   - The editeur A pays Marc 5 cents per phrase.
   - The editeur B pays Marc twice as much as the editeur A, so it pays \( 2 \times 5 \) cents per phrase, which is 10 cents per phrase.

3. **Calculate Marc's earnings from each editor:**
   - Earnings from the editeur A: \( 500 \text{ phrases} \times 5 \text{ cents/phrase} = 2500 \text{ cents} \).
   - Earnings from the editeur B: \( 500 \text{ phrases} \times 10 \text{ cents/phrase} = 5000 \text{ cents} \).

4. **Calculate Marc's total earnings for the week:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from editeur A + Earnings from editeur B

Next, we calculate Sara's total earnings from baby-sitting and mowing the lawn. She earns 5$ each time she baby-sits and mows the lawn, and she baby-sits 4 times. Thus, her earnings from baby-sitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\)$. Additionally, she receives 4$ each time she mows the lawn. Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn. Her earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\). Her total earnings from baby-sitting and mowing the lawn are \(20 + 4x\).

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the pools would have had:

- Large pool: \( L + 4 \times 4 = L + 16 \) gallons
- Small pool: \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons

Given that 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ L + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ L = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that at the present time, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the current amounts of water are:
- Large pool: \( L - 4 \times 4 = L - 16 \) gallons
- Small pool: \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons

Given that the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can write the equation:
\[ L - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]
\[ L - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ L = 4S - 48 \]

We now have two equations for \( L \):
\[ L = 2S + 16 \]
\[ L = 4S - 48 \]

We can set these two expressions for \( L \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S - 48 \]
\[ 16 + 48 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 64 = 2S \]

1. Identify the number of roses in the vase.
2. Calculate the number of dahlias based on the given information.
3. Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Step 1: Identify the number of roses.
The problem states that there are 4 roses in the vase.
\[ \text{Number of roses} = 4 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of dahlias.
The problem also states that there are 7 dahlias de plus qu'il n'y a de roses, which translates to 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias is:
\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of flowers.
The total number of flowers is the sum of the number of roses and the number of dahlias:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

mgsm-fr-218,"To find the age of each person and their average age in three years, we start by determining Harriet's current age and then use that information to find the ages of Adrian and Zack.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Since Harriet's age is the half of Zack's age, we can find Zack's current age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so we calculate Adrian's current age as:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}

1. **Bus Travel Time:**
   André spends 6 days traveling by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Car Travel Time:**
   The car travel time is stated to be half the time it takes to travel by bus. Therefore, the car travel time is:

He has:
- 30 cards of type feu (fire)
- 20 cards of type herbe (grass)
- 40 cards of type eau (water)

So, the initial total number of cards is:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]

Next, James loses 8 cards of type eau and buys 14 cards of type herbe. The new quantities are:
- Cards of type feu: 30 (unchanged)
- Cards of type herbe: \(20 - 8 + 14 = 26\) (initial 20 minus 8 plus 14)
- Cards of type eau: \(40 - 8 = 32\) (initial 40 minus 8)

Now, the new total number of cards is:
\[ 30 + 26 + 32 = 88 \]

We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen card is of type eau. The probability \(P\) is given by the ratio of the number of eau cards to the total number of cards:
\[ P = \frac{\text{Number of eau cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{88} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{88} = \frac{4}{11} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{4}{11} \approx 0.3636 \]

Convert this to a percentage by multiplying by 100:
\[ 0.3636 \times 100 \approx 36.36 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[ 36.36 \approx 36 \]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen card is of type eau is approximately 36%, and the final answer is:

   - Jean drives back home immediately after realizing he forgot something. He drives for 2 hours at 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 2 hours = 60 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - After returning home, Jean drives for the remaining time (4 hours total - 2 hours already spent - 0.5 hours in traffic) at 80 mph.
   - Remaining time = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

4. **Total Distance:**
   - Total distance from home = Distance of first segment + Distance of second segment + Distance of third segment.
   - Total distance = 180 miles + 60 miles + 120 miles = 360 miles.

Therefore, the distance Jean is from his home at the end of 4 hours is $\boxed{360}$.",360,45

mgsm-fr-12,"To determine how many years Carlos needs to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net annual profit and set it to be greater than or equal to zero.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.50.

Annual revenue from lemons = \( 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.50 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.50 \text{ per year} \).

Next, let's calculate the annual expenses:
- The cost of planting the tree is $90.
- The cost of watering and fertilizing the tree is $3 per year.

Annual expenses = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (watering and fertilizing) = $93 per year.

Now, we can find the annual profit by subtracting the annual expenses from the annual revenue:
- Annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual expenses = $10.50 - $93 = -$82.50 per year.

Since the annual profit is negative, Carlos will not start making a profit in any finite number of years. In fact, he will always incur a loss. Therefore, the number of years required for Carlos to start making a profit is:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking.
2. Determine the remaining distance and the time she has left to cover that distance.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles.
- She spent 1 hour on the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent so far is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Let's denote the total time Marissa will take to complete the hike as \(T\) hours. Since her average speed is 4 miles per hour, the total distance of 12 miles must be covered in \(T\) hours:
\[ 4T = 12 \]
\[ T = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

This means Marissa has \(3 - 2 = 1\) hour left to complete her hike. The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 - (4 + 2) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa must achieve a speed of 6 miles per hour for the remaining distance. The required speed is:

4. Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of remaining mixture.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange juice.**

The orange juice is composed of \(\frac{2}{3}\) water. Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange juice is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple juice.**

The pineapple juice is composed of \(\frac{3}{4}\) water. Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple juice is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{45}{4} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the amount of water in the 9 liters of orange juice after one liter is spilled.**

Since one liter of orange juice is spilled, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange juice is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of remaining mixture.**

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of remaining mixture is the sum of the water from the orange juice and the pineapple juice:
\[ 6 + \frac{45}{4} = \frac{24}{4} + \frac{45}{4} = \frac{69}{4} \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water in the 24 liters of remaining mixture is:

Since this total is \( B - 5 \):
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

Let's denote the current age of Darell as \(7x\) and the current age of Allen as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find the current ages of Darell and Allen. The current age of Darell is:

mgsm-fr-35,"To determine the total number of points Mike has scored, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the next 20 minutes.

1. Calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
   Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. Calculate the points scored in the next 20 minutes:
   Mike scored 25% more points in the next 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. First, we need to find 25% of 4 points:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the points scored in the next 20 minutes are:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the total points scored:
   The total points scored are the sum of the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the points scored in the next 20 minutes:

   4 + 5 = 9
   \]

Thus, the total number of points Mike has scored is \(\boxed{9}\).",9,9
mgsm-fr-36,"To determine how much money Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the yogurt Terry buys.
2. Multiply the daily cost by the number of days (30 days) to find the total cost over the period.

First, let's find out how much Terry spends on yogurt each day. Terry buys 2 yaourts each day. The price for 4 yaourts is $5.00. Therefore, the price for 2 yaourts can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Price per 2 yaourts} = \frac{5.00}{4} \times 2 = 2.50
\]

So, Terry spends $2.50 on yogurt each day. Now, we need to find out how much he spends over 30 days:

\[
\text{Total cost over 30 days} = 2.50 \times 30 = 75.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[

mgsm-fr-37,"To determine how much money Jean has left from selling his Lego sets, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he received from selling his Lego sets. Jean sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each.

\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

So, Jean received $195 from selling his Lego sets. Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on the video games. He bought 8 video games at $20 each.

\[
8 \times 20 = 160
\]

Jean spent $160 on the video games. According to the problem, after these purchases, Jean was left with $5. Therefore, the total amount of money he had before buying the video games is the sum of the money he received from selling the Lego sets and the money he had left after the purchases.

\[
195 + 5 = 200
\]

So, Jean initially had $200. The amount of money he spent on the video games is $160, so the amount of money he had left after buying the video games is $5. Since he sold all 13 Lego sets, the amount of money he had left after the purchases is the same as the money he had left after the purchases, which is $5. This means he did not have any Lego sets left because he spent all the money he had.

Therefore, the number of Lego sets Jean has left is:

\[
\boxed{0}

mgsm-fr-38,"To determine Jean's speed of running, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in one week and the total time he spends running in that week.

First, let's find out how far Jean runs each day. We know that Jean runs a total of 60 miles in a week and runs 3 days a week. So, the distance he runs each day is:
\[
\text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day}
\]

Next, we need to determine how long Jean runs each day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the second and third days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is:
\[
\text{Time on second and third days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total time Jean spends running in a week. The total time is the sum of the time he spends running each day:
\[
\text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Jean's speed of running is the total distance he runs divided by the total time he spends running. Therefore, his speed is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

So, Jean's speed of running is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10
mgsm-fr-39,"Let's denote Dana's walking speed as \( w \) miles per hour (mph).

From the problem, we know:
1. Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, so it is \( 4w \) mph.
2. Dana's jumping speed is twice her running speed, so it is \( 2 \times 4w = 8w \) mph.
3. We are given that her jumping speed is 3 mph, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   8w = 3 \implies w = \frac{3}{8} \text{ mph}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of her time running and \( \frac{2}{3} \) of her time walking. Therefore, the time spent running is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
And the time spent walking is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana covers while running and walking:
- Distance covered while running:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_\text{running} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 4w \times 2 = 4 \times \frac{3}{8} \times 2 = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ miles}
  \]
- Distance covered while walking:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_\text{walking} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = w \times 4 = \frac{3}{8} \times 4 = \frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \text{ miles}
  \]

The total distance Dana covers in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Dana covers in six hours is \(\boxed{4.5}\).",5,18

2. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzie's iPhone, so \( B = 2S \).
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so \( Br = 4B \).

First, we calculate the age of Ben's iPhone:
\[ B = 2S = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Next, we calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone:
\[ Br = 4B = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Thus, Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\) years old.",8,8
mgsm-fr-41,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Polly can throw the precious stone so that she is still within 400 feet of the dragon, but far enough to hit it with the golden javelin.

1. **Identify the initial distance Polly can throw the javelin:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.

2. **Determine the new distance Polly can throw the precious stone:**
   - Polly can throw the precious stone three times the distance of the javelin.
   - Therefore, the new distance is \( 3 \times 400 = 1200 \) feet.

3. **Calculate the safe distance from the dragon:**
   - To be within 400 feet of the dragon, Polly must throw the precious stone at least 400 feet away from the dragon.
   - This means the maximum distance Polly can throw the precious stone and still be within 400 feet of the dragon is \( 400 \) feet.

4. **Determine the distance Polly can throw the precious stone to hit the dragon:**
   - Since Polly can throw the precious stone 1200 feet, and she needs to be within 400 feet of the dragon, the distance she can throw the precious stone and still hit the dragon is \( 1200 - 400 = 800 \) feet.

Thus, the distance Polly can throw the precious stone and still be within 400 feet of the dragon, while still being able to hit the dragon, is 800 feet.

The final answer is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,200

mgsm-fr-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you should eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are in one gram of chips. We know that a 300 g bag contains 5 portions, and each portion contains 250 calories. Therefore, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Since the bag weighs 300 grams, the number of calories per gram is:

\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} = \frac{25}{6} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day. Your goal is 2000 calories per day, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat to consume exactly 200 calories, we use the calories per gram we calculated:

\[ \text{Grams of chips} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{\frac{25}{6} \text{ calories/gram}} = 200 \times \frac{6}{25} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams of chips you should eat is:

mgsm-fr-44,"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate both his total revenue and total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Charlie sells each bougie for $2.00.
   - If he sells 20 bougies, his total revenue is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \text{ bougies} \times \$2.00 \text{ per bougie} = \$40.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each bougie requires 1/10 of a pound of beeswax.
   - Therefore, 20 bougies require:
     \[
     \text{Total beeswax} = 20 \text{ bougies} \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ pound per bougie} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]
   - Each pound of beeswax costs $10.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the beeswax is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of beeswax} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]
   - Charlie also needs mèches, but the problem does not specify the cost of mèches. Assuming no additional cost for mèches, the total cost is just the cost of the beeswax.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Net Profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00

1. Calculate the number of articles Mérédith wrote on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.
3. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Lundi (Monday):** Mérédith rédigea 5 articles.
- **Mardi (Tuesday):** Elle rédigea \( \frac{2}{5} \) plus d'articles que le lundi. Donc, elle rédigea \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Mercredi (Wednesday):** Elle rédigea deux fois plus d'articles que le mardi. Donc, elle rédigea \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Total articles = Articles lundi + Articles mardi + Articles mercredi
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles.**

Each article takes 4 hours to write, so the total number of hours spent writing 26 articles is:

mgsm-fr-46,"Let's denote the number of additional think-bes in the package Candice bought as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 think-bes. After buying the package, she had \( 80 + x \) think-bes. She then used some of these think-bes to place one on each of the 220 coffee cups. After using these, she had 23 think-bes left. This means that the number of think-bes she used is \( 80 + x - 23 \).

Since she used these think-bes to place one on each of the 220 coffee cups, the number of think-bes used is equal to 220. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 23 = 220 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 57 + x = 220 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 57 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 220 - 57 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of think-bes in the package Candice bought is \( \boxed{163} \).",163,163
mgsm-fr-94,"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of rabbits as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of dogs and cats is 60.
2. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats.
3. For every dog, there are 2 cats.

First, we can express the total number of dogs and cats as:
\[ D + C = 60 \]

Next, the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats:
\[ R = (D + C) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Since for each dog there are 2 cats, we can express the number of cats as:
\[ C = 2D \]

Now we substitute \( C = 2D \) into the equation \( D + C = 60 \):
\[ D + 2D = 60 \]
\[ 3D = 60 \]
\[ D = 20 \]

Now we can find the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, the number of dogs is 20, the number of cats is 40, and the number of rabbits is 48. The total number of animals in the neighborhood is:
\[ D + C + R = 20 + 40 + 48 = 108 \]

mgsm-fr-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henri planned to make this year as \( x \). According to the problem, he wants to make two times more cookies this year than last year, so if last year he made \( y \) cookies, then this year he planned to make \( 2y \) cookies.

However, he actually made \( 2y + 15 \) cookies. After making them, he dropped 5 cookies, so he was left with \( 2y + 15 - 5 = 2y + 10 \) cookies. We know that this total is 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2y + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( y \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2y = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ y = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henri planned to make last year is \( y = 50 \). Therefore, the answer is:

mgsm-fr-109,"To determine the total cost after the remboursements, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any remboursements:**
   - The price of one gallon of gasoline is $3.00.
   - The person buys 10 gallons.
   - Therefore, the total cost without remboursements is:
     \[
     10 \text{ gallons} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total remboursement:**
   - The remboursement offered is $0.20 per gallon.
   - The person buys 10 gallons.
   - Therefore, the total remboursement is:
     \[
     10 \text{ gallons} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the final cost after remboursements:**
   - Subtract the total remboursement from the total cost without remboursements:
     \[
     30.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 28.00 \text{ dollars}

Thus, the final cost after the remboursements is \(\boxed{28.00}\).",0,28
mgsm-fr-110,"To determine the average number of roulés eaten by Marcell and Béatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roulés each of them ate.

Béatrice has 24 roulés longs and 2 roulés larges, so the total number of roulés Béatrice ate is:
\[ 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Marcell has 14 roulés longs and 3 roulés larges, so the total number of roulés Marcell ate is:
\[ 14 + 3 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of roulés eaten by both Marcell and Béatrice combined:
\[ 26 + 17 = 43 \]

Since there are two people (Marcell and Béatrice), the average number of roulés eaten is the total number of roulés divided by 2:
\[ \frac{43}{2} = 21.5 \]

Thus, the average number of roulés eaten by Marcell and Béatrice is \(\boxed{21.5}\).",5,45
mgsm-fr-111,"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the speed of the boat:**
   Julia took 16 seconds to cover 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. **Determine the time it takes to reach the shore:**
   The distance to the shore is 64 feet. Using the speed calculated:
   \[
   \text{Time to reach the shore} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{1.25 \text{ feet/second}} = 51.2 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance covered in 51.2 seconds:**
   In 51.2 seconds, the boat will have covered:
   \[
   \text{Distance covered} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 51.2 \text{ seconds} = 64 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the distance remaining to the shore:**
   Since the total distance to the shore is 64 feet and the boat has already covered 64 feet, the remaining distance is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 64 \text{ feet} - 64 \text{ feet} = 0 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is 0 feet, so the time taken to cover this distance is:
   \[
   \text{Time to cover remaining distance} = 0 \text{ seconds}
   \]

6. **Determine the time spent taking on water:**
   The total time taken to reach the shore is 51.2 seconds. Since the remaining distance is 0 feet, the time spent taking on water is:
   \[
   \text{Time spent taking on water} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} - 0 \text{ seconds} = 51.2 \text{ seconds}
   \]

7. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   The boat takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet. To find the total amount of water taken on in 51.2 seconds, we first determine how many 10-foot segments are covered in 51.2 seconds:
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{51.2 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 5.12 \text{ segments}
   \]
   Since each segment corresponds to 2 liters of water:
   \[
   \text{Total water taken on} = 5.12 \text{ segments} \times 2 \text{ liters/segment} = 10.24 \text{ liters}

1. **Determine the capacity of Jamal's phone:**
   Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos.

2. **Determine the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   According to the problem, Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of Jamal's phone} = 6 \times \text{Capacity of Brittany's phone}
   \]
   Substituting Jamal's phone capacity:
   \[
   1800 = 6 \times \text{Capacity of Brittany's phone}
   \]
   Solving for Brittany's phone capacity:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of Brittany's phone} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300

First, let's calculate the total cost of the wood:

1. **Cost of the 10 planches of 2 x 4 x 10:**
   Each planch costs $10.
   \[
   10 \text{ planches} \times 10 \text{ dollars per planch} = 100 \text{ dollars}

2. **Cost of the 5 planches of 4 x 4 x 10:**
   Each planch costs $16.
   \[
   5 \text{ planches} \times 16 \text{ dollars per planch} = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[
100 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the wood:

1. **Revenue from selling the 10 planches of 2 x 4 x 10:**
   Each planch is sold at the original price of $10.
   \[
   10 \text{ planches} \times 10 \text{ dollars per planch} = 100 \text{ dollars}

2. **Revenue from selling the 5 planches of 4 x 4 x 10:**
   Each planch is sold at the original price of $16.
   \[
   5 \text{ planches} \times 16 \text{ dollars per planch} = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these revenues together gives the total revenue:
\[

Given:
- Adrien's initial salary \( A = 40,000 \) dollars.
- Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's initial salary. Therefore, we have:
  \[
  A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
  \]
  Substituting \( A = 40,000 \):
  \[
  40,000 = 1.3L \implies L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23
  \]

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[
A_{\text{new}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A = 1.4 \times 40,000 = 56,000

First, let's calculate the total revenue from patient consultations. Each patient is examined for 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the revenue from each patient is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ dollars/patient} \]

The hospital admits 500 patients per day, so the total revenue from consultations is:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/patient} \times 500 \text{ patients/day} = 30000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the consultations. The hospital charges $200 per hour to patients, and each patient is examined for 0.4 hours, so the cost to each patient is:

Step 1: Expenses for May
The expenses for May are given as $500.

Step 2: Expenses for June
The expenses for June are $60 less than those in May. Therefore, we subtract $60 from $500:
\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]
So, the expenses for June are $440.

Step 3: Total expenses for May and June
To find the total expenses for the two months, we add the expenses for May and June:
\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Thus, the total sum of the expenses for May and June is \(\boxed{940}\).",940,940

First, let's calculate the tickets used by Pam:
- Pam made 2 tours of the roller coaster.
- Each tour costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the total tickets used by Pam for the roller coaster is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also made 2 trips on the luge.
- Each trip on the luge costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the total tickets used by Pam for the luge is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Pam is \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the tickets used by Fred:
- Fred made 4 tours of the roller coaster.
- Each tour costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the total tickets used by Fred for the roller coaster is \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.

mgsm-fr-133,"To determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Use the total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the distance walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday:
\[ \text{Distance walked on Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. We can express this as the sum of the distances walked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[ \text{Distance walked on Monday} + \text{Distance walked on Tuesday} + \text{Distance walked on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ 4 + 24 + \text{Distance walked on Wednesday} = 41 \]

Let's denote the distance walked on Wednesday as \( x \). Then we have:
\[ 4 + 24 + x = 41 \]
\[ 28 + x = 41 \]
\[ x = 41 - 28 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

Therefore, the distance Walt walked on Wednesday is \(\boxed{13}\).",13,13

- Cost of 2 paquets de frites: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\) dollars
- Cost of 2 biscuits: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\) dollars

Now, let's sum these costs to get the total cost before any additional charges:

Total cost before charges = \(15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\) dollars

Next, we calculate the 20% delivery fee:

Delivery fee = \(20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\) dollars

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost:

Total cost with delivery fee = \(20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\) dollars

Rory then adds a 5.00 dollar tip:

mgsm-fr-140,"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of semi-automatic cars.
2. Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars based on the total number of cars.

First, we know the total number of cars is 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. The rest are semi-automatic. So, we calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The percentage is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\%

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total number of bees is 700.
2. There are two times more ouvrières than bébés abeilles.
3. There are two times more bébés than reines.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
1. \( R + B + O = 700 \)
2. \( O = 2B \)
3. \( B = 2R \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( O \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

From equation 3, we have \( B = 2R \).
From equation 2, we have \( O = 2B = 2(2R) = 4R \).

Now substitute \( B = 2R \) and \( O = 4R \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ R + 2R + 4R = 700 \]
\[ 7R = 700 \]
\[ R = 100 \]

Now that we have \( R = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( O \):
\[ B = 2R = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ O = 4R = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of abeilles ouvrières is \( \boxed{400} \).",400,400

- Each allers-retour is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Total distance for Blake = 15 allers-retours * 200 yards/allers-retour = 3000 yards.

Next, let's calculate Kelly's total distance:
- Kelly runs 34 allers-retours on a 40-yard segment of the field.
- Each allers-retour is 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back).
- Total distance for Kelly = 34 allers-retours * 80 yards/allers-retour = 2720 yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake ran 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran 2720 yards.

The difference in distance is:
\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, Blake ran 280 yards more than Kelly. Enclosing the final number:

1. Initially, Finn observes 11 tadpoles.
2. Then, 6 tadpoles emerge from under a lily pad. This increases the count by 6.
3. After that, 2 tadpoles go back under a rock. This decreases the count by 2.

We can calculate the current number of tadpoles by performing the following arithmetic operations:

- Initial count: 11 tadpoles
- Increase due to tadpoles emerging: +6
- Decrease due to tadpoles hiding: -2

So, the calculation is:
\[ 11 + 6 - 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can now see in the pond is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

1. Calculate the number of fish Locsin caught:
   - Anakin caught 10 étoiles de mer, 6 hippocampes, and 3 poissons-clowns.
   - Locsin caught 5 étoiles de mer less than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) étoiles de mer.
   - Locsin caught 3 hippocampes less than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) hippocampes.
   - Locsin caught 2 poissons-clowns more than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) poissons-clowns.
   - Therefore, Locsin caught a total of \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

2. Calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
   - Anakin caught \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.

mgsm-fr-162,"To determine the cost of a sack of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound pricing.

The formula is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the monthly growth rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Given:
- The initial price \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars,
- The monthly growth rate \( r = \frac{20\%}{2} = 10\% = 0.10 \),
- The number of months \( n = 36 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ P = 20 \times (1 + 0.10)^{36/2} \]
\[ P = 20 \times (1.10)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.10)^{18} \). Using a calculator:
\[ (1.10)^{18} \approx 4.5597 \]

So,
\[ P \approx 20 \times 4.5597 = 91.194 \]

1. **Calculate the potential earnings lost by doing her own tax returns:**
   - Jackie can save 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour for freelance work.
   - Therefore, the total potential earnings lost is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of hiring a professional:**
   - The cost of hiring a professional is $90.

3. **Determine the net additional cost Jackie would incur by hiring a professional:**

From the problem, we know that Seth is 2 times as old as Brooke. Therefore, we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In two years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28. Therefore, we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):

   This seems incorrect because ages cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. It seems there might be a typo or misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that Sally Thirtytwo is 32 years older than Sally Two, and Sally Two is 8 years old. So, \( S_2 = 8 - 32 = -24 \) is not possible, and we should recheck the problem statement. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that Sally Thirtytwo is 32 years older than Sally Two, and Sally Two is 8 years old.

\text{Votes for the winning candidate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the losing candidate received is the remaining votes after the winning candidate has received his share:
\[
\text{Votes for the losing candidate} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the losing candidate obtained is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
mgsm-fr-181,"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is \( 4x \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 red lilies of the calla, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5x = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( x \):
\[
5x = 200 \implies x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now, we find the number of red roses ordered:
\[
4x = 4 \times 40 = 160

mgsm-fr-182,"To determine Jean's age, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine Marc's current age:**
   - Jan is 30 years old.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - Let Marc's current age be \(M\).
   - Two years ago, Marc was \(M - 2\) years old.
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - So, we can write the equation: \(M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5\).
   - Simplify the right side: \(M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19\).
   - Solve for \(M\): \(M = 19 + 2 = 21\).
   - Therefore, Marc is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Marc.
   - So, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

mgsm-fr-183,"To determine how long it will take the faster team to complete the 400 meters relay race, we first need to calculate the time taken by each member of the slower team to complete their leg of the race.

The first runner of the slower team takes 60 seconds to complete 400 meters. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds.
- The third runner takes \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds.
- The fourth runner takes \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds.

Next, we sum the times for the slower team:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

The faster team, where each runner completes 400 meters in 55 seconds, will take:
\[

mgsm-fr-184,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die twice in succession, and compare it to the probability of rolling an even number twice in succession.

First, let's identify the possible outcomes and their probabilities for a single roll of the die:
- The die has six faces: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
- The numbers greater than 3 are: 4, 5, 6.
- The numbers that are even are: 2, 4, 6.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 twice in succession:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3 \text{ and } \text{number} > 3) = P(\text{number} > 3) \times P(\text{number} > 3) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \]

Similarly, the probability of rolling an even number twice in succession is:
\[ P(\text{even number and } \text{even number}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 twice in succession rather than rolling an even number twice in succession. This is the difference between the two probabilities:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3 \text{ and } \text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even number and } \text{even number}) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = 0 \]

Since the probabilities are equal, the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 twice in succession is the same as the probability that he will roll an even number twice in succession. Therefore, the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in succession is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \]

Converting this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

We are given that her mother collected 20 apples:
\[ M = 20 \]

Substituting \( M = 20 \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of apples they collected together, we add the number of apples Jenna collected to the number her mother collected:

According to the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. The total number of pieces is 110.
2. The number of gold pieces is 30 more than the number of silver pieces.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver pieces \( S \), we can find the number of gold pieces \( G \) using the second equation:

polymath-low-fr-36,"To determine how much money Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of one yogurt.
2. Determine the total cost for 30 days.

First, let's find out how much one yogurt costs. Since Terry buys 2 yogurts for $5.00, the cost of one yogurt is:
\[
\text{Cost of one yogurt} = \frac{5.00}{2} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt in one day. Since he buys 2 yogurts each day, the daily cost is:
\[
\text{Daily cost} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we multiply the daily cost by 30:

2. Calculate the total cost of the video games he buys.
3. Determine how much money Jean has left after buying the video games.
4. Calculate how much money Jean initially had from selling the Lego sets, and then find out how much he spent on the video games.

Let's start with the first step:

Jean has 13 Lego sets, and he sells each set for $15. Therefore, the total amount of money he earns from selling the Lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Jean is left with $5 after buying the video games. Therefore, the amount of money he spent on the video games is:
\[ 195 - 5 = 190 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the amount he spent on the video games is $160, the remaining amount of money he has is:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to get $35. Since each Lego set is sold for $15, the number of Lego sets he sold is:
\[ \frac{35}{15} = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.33 \]

Since Jean can only sell whole Lego sets, he sold 2 sets. Therefore, the number of Lego sets he has left is:
\[ 13 - 2 = 11 \]

So, the number of Lego sets Jean has left is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]",11,2
polymath-low-fr-38,"To determine Jean's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running. Then, we can use these to find his speed.

First, let's find out how far Jean runs each day. We know that Jean runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. Therefore, the distance he runs each day is:

\[
\text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day}
\]

Next, we need to determine how long he runs each day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the second and third days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is:

\[
\text{Time per day} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total time Jean spends running in a week. He runs for 3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on each of the next two days:

\[
\text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we can find Jean's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

\]

So, Jean's speed is \boxed{10}.",10,10
polymath-low-fr-39,"Let's denote Dana's walking speed as \( w \) miles per hour (mph). According to the problem, Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, so her running speed is \( 4w \) mph. Additionally, her jumping speed is two times less than her running speed, which is given as 3 mph. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 4w = 3 \]

Solving for \( w \):

\[ w = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, we know Dana's walking speed is \( \frac{3}{4} \) mph and her running speed is 3 mph. The problem states that Dana spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of her time running and \( \frac{2}{3} \) of her time walking. Over a period of 6 hours, the time spent running and walking can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Time running} = 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Dana covers while running and walking over these times:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4 = 3 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance Dana covers in 6 hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana covers in 6 hours is:

We need to find the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the sapphire stone such that she is still within the 1000 feet range of the dragon's flames. This means the distance she can throw the javelin with the sapphire stone must be less than or equal to 1000 feet.

3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of producing 20 bougies.**

Each book of beeswax allows Charlie to produce 10 bougies. Therefore, to produce 20 bougies, he needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ bougies}}{10 \text{ bougies per book}} = 2 \text{ books of beeswax} \]

The cost of one book of beeswax is $10.00, so the total cost for 2 books is:

The total length of the wire is 4 feet. Converting this to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces of 6 inches can be cut from 48 inches, we divide the total length by the length of each piece:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied apartments.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied apartments.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments is:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these apartments are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the apartments are occupied. So, the number of occupied apartments is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Now, to find the number of unoccupied apartments, we subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of unoccupied apartments is:

polymath-low-fr-50,"To determine how much Lloyd earns in a week from selling his eggs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a day.
2. Determine the total number of eggs produced in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs produced in a day.**

Lloyd's poules produce 252 eggs per day.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of eggs produced in a week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs produced in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.**

Eggs are sold at $2 per dozen. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ dollars}}{12 \text{ eggs}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ dollars/egg} \]

Therefore, the total revenue from selling 1764 eggs is:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ dollars/egg} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Lloyd earns \(\boxed{294}\) dollars per week from selling his eggs.",294,294
polymath-low-fr-51,"To determine how long it will take Tom to return home, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then determine the time required to cover that distance at his return speed.

1. Calculate the distance traveled during the outbound journey:
   - Tom travels from 13:00 to 16:00, which is a duration of 3 hours.
   - His speed during the outbound journey is 10 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance traveled during the outbound journey is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}

polymath-low-fr-52,"Let's denote the number of bandes dessinées Uriah has as \( B \) and the number of jouets as \( J \).

First, we know that each bande dessinée weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a pound and each jouet weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a pound. Uriah needs to reduce his total weight by 15 pounds. The total weight of his bandes dessinées and jouets can be expressed as:

\[ \frac{1}{4}B + \frac{1}{2}J \]

After removing 30 bandes dessinées, the new total weight will be:

\[ \frac{1}{4}(B - 30) + \frac{1}{2}J \]

We know that this new total weight should be 15 pounds less than the original total weight, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{1}{4}B + \frac{1}{2}J - 15 = \frac{1}{4}(B - 30) + \frac{1}{2}J \]

To simplify, we can subtract \( \frac{1}{2}J \) from both sides:

\[ \frac{1}{4}B - 15 = \frac{1}{4}(B - 30) \]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by multiplying every term by 4:

\[ B - 60 = B - 30 \]

Subtract \( B \) from both sides:

\[ -60 = -30 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ B = 60 \]

So, Uriah originally has 60 bandes dessinées. Now, we need to find out how many jouets he has. Let's denote the total weight of the bandes dessinées and jouets as \( W \):

\[ W = \frac{1}{4}B + \frac{1}{2}J \]

Since \( B = 60 \):

\[ W = \frac{1}{4}(60) + \frac{1}{2}J = 15 + \frac{1}{2}J \]

After removing 30 bandes dessinées, the new weight is:

\[ W - 15 = \frac{1}{4}(60 - 30) + \frac{1}{2}J = 15 + \frac{1}{2}J \]

We know this new weight is 15 pounds less than the original weight:

\[ 15 + \frac{1}{2}J - 15 = 15 + \frac{1}{2}J - 15 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{2}J = 15 \]

So, \( J = 30 \). Uriah has 30 jouets. To find out how many jouets he needs to remove to achieve the weight reduction, we need to determine how many jouets weigh 15 pounds in total. Since each jouet weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of jouets to be removed is:

\[ \frac{15}{\frac{1}{2}} = 30 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{30}\) jouets.",30,15

polymath-low-fr-74,"To determine how much money Artie will earn, we need to round each type of flower's price to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's round the prices:
- Soucis: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Pétunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Bégonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

polymath-low-fr-75,"To determine the average surface area of an individual sandcastle tower, we need to first find the surface areas of all four towers and then compute their average.

Given:
- The surface area of the topmost tower (the 4th tower) is 16 square feet.
- Each subsequent tower has half the surface area of the tower immediately below it.

Let's denote the surface area of the 4th tower as \( A_4 \). According to the problem:
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]

The surface area of the 3rd tower (\( A_3 \)) is half of \( A_4 \):
\[ A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

The surface area of the 2nd tower (\( A_2 \)) is half of \( A_3 \):
\[ A_2 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet} \]

The surface area of the 1st tower (\( A_1 \)) is half of \( A_2 \):
\[ A_1 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet} \]

Now we have the surface areas of all four towers:
\[ A_1 = 2 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = 4 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_3 = 8 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average surface area of the four towers, we sum these areas and divide by 4:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{30}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 7.5 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average surface area of an individual sandcastle tower is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60
polymath-low-fr-76,"To determine how many sacks of dog food Cécilia will use in the first 180 days, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of dog food required during this period and then convert that into sacks.

1. **Calculate the number of bowls for the first 180 days:**
   - Cécilia needs 1 bowl of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total bowls for the first 180 days = 180 bowls.

2. **Calculate the number of bowls for the remaining days (assuming the dog lives for 365 days):**
   - The dog will live for 365 days in total.
   - Days remaining after the first 180 days = 365 - 180 = 185 days.
   - Cécilia will need 2 bowls of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total bowls for the remaining 185 days = 2 bowls/day * 185 days = 370 bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the entire first year:**
   - Total bowls = bowls for the first 180 days + bowls for the remaining 185 days
   - Total bowls = 180 bowls + 370 bowls = 550 bowls.

4. **Convert the total number of bowls into sacks of dog food:**
   - Each sack contains 110 bowls.

polymath-low-fr-5,"To determine how much Kylar will pay for 16 glasses, we need to account for the discount on every second glass. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the pricing structure:**
   - The first glass costs $5.
   - Every second glass (i.e., the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) costs $60\%$ of $5, which is $3.

2. **Calculate the cost for every pair of glasses:**
   - Each pair (1st and 2nd, 3rd and 4th, etc.) consists of 1 glass at $5 and 1 glass at $3.
   - The total cost for one pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

3. **Determine the number of complete pairs in 16 glasses:**
   - Since there are 16 glasses, there are $\frac{16}{2} = 8$ pairs.

4. **Calculate the total cost for 8 pairs:**
   - The total cost for 8 pairs is $8 \times 8 = $64.

5. **Check if there is any remaining glass:**
   - Since 16 is an even number, there are no remaining glasses to be considered individually.

Thus, the total amount Kylar will pay for 16 glasses is $64.

The final answer is $\boxed{64}$.",64,64
polymath-low-fr-6,"First, let's determine the number of sheep Charleston has. According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times more sheep than Seattle. Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep Charleston has as follows:

Charleston's sheep = 4 * Seattle's sheep
Charleston's sheep = 4 * 20 = 80

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. The problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Since Charleston has 80 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep Toulouse has as follows:

Toulouse's sheep = 2 * Charleston's sheep
Toulouse's sheep = 2 * 80 = 160

Now, we need to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together. We add the number of sheep each of them has:

Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have is $\\boxed{260}$.",260,260

polymath-low-fr-12,"To determine how many years Carlos will need to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net annual profit and then find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.50.

\[
\text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times 1.50 \text{ $/lemon} = 10.50 \text{ $/year}
\]

Next, we account for the annual costs:
- The cost of planting the tree is $90.
- The annual cost of watering and nourishing the tree is $3.

\[
\text{Annual cost} = 90 \text{ $ (initial cost)} + 3 \text{ $ (annual cost)} = 93 \text{ $/year}
\]

Now, we calculate the net annual profit by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:

\[
\text{Net annual profit} = 10.50 \text{ $/year} - 93 \text{ $/year} = -82.50 \text{ $/year}
\]

Since the net annual profit is negative, Carlos will not start making a profit in the first year. We need to determine the number of years it will take for the net profit to become positive.

Let \( n \) be the number of years Carlos needs to wait to start making a profit. The total cost after \( n \) years is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 90 \text{ $ (initial cost)} + 3n \text{ $ (annual cost)} = 90 + 3n \text{ $}
\]

The total revenue after \( n \) years is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 10.50n \text{ $}
\]

We need the total revenue to equal the total cost at the point of breaking even:

\[
90 + 3n = 10.50n
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
90 = 10.50n - 3n
\]
\[
90 = 7.50n
\]
\[
n = \frac{90}{7.50} = 12

Therefore, Carlos will start making a profit after 12 years. The final answer is:

2. She then sold 2 aspirators at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) left.
3. Finally, she sold half of the remaining aspirators at the orange house, so she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \) left.

According to the problem, after these sales, she had 5 aspirators left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 12 \]

3. Multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \) to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \]

So, Mélanie initially had \( 18 \) aspirators.

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking.
2. Determine the remaining distance and the remaining time required to achieve the desired average speed.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles.
- She spent 1 hour on the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent so far is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile hike. Therefore, the total time required to complete the hike at this average speed is:
\[
\text{Total time required} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Since she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time she needs to complete the hike is:

First, calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange juice. Since the orange juice is composed of two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange juice is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple juice. Since the pineapple juice is composed of three-quarters water, the amount of water in the pineapple juice is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{45}{4} \text{ liters} \]

Now, the total amount of water before any is lost is the sum of the water from the orange juice and the pineapple juice:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + \frac{45}{4} = \frac{80}{12} + \frac{135}{12} = \frac{215}{12} \text{ liters} \]

After losing 1 liter of orange juice, the total volume of the remaining mixture is:
\[ 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining mixture is the total amount of water before the loss minus the 1 liter of orange juice that was lost. Since the 1 liter of orange juice that was lost was composed of \(\frac{2}{3}\) water, the amount of water lost is:
\[ 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of mixture is:
\[ \frac{215}{12} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{215}{12} - \frac{8}{12} = \frac{207}{12} = \frac{69}{4} \text{ liters} \]

polymath-low-fr-30,"Let's denote Darell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we need to find Allen's current age, which is \(11x\):

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109

Now, we have the three estimations: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these estimations and divide by the number of estimations:

\[
\text{Sum of estimations} = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

2. Calculate the total amount of water the two girls received together.
3. Subtract the total amount of water the two girls received from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left.
4. Subtract the amount of water the boy received from the remaining water.

First, we calculate the amount of water each girl received. Since each girl received \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the 24 liters of water:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]
Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
\[

Next, we subtract the total amount of water the girls received from the initial amount of water:
\[
24 - 8 = 16 \text{ liters}

So, the total number of epines is \(\boxed{600}\).",600,600
polymath-low-fr-84,"Let's denote the number of times the team won as \( W \) and the number of times the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of matches played is 22, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that the team won \( x \) times more than it lost, which translates to:

\[ W = L + x \]

We can substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the first equation. From \( W = L + x \), we can express \( L \) as \( L = W - x \). Substituting this into the first equation gives:

\[ W + (W - x) = 22 \]
\[ 2W - x = 22 \]
\[ 2W = 22 + x \]
\[ W = \frac{22 + x}{2} \]

Since \( W \) and \( L \) must be integers, \( 22 + x \) must be even, implying that \( x \) must be even. Let's test some even values for \( x \) to find a suitable integer solution for \( W \).

If \( x = 2 \):

\[ W = \frac{22 + 2}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]
\[ L = W - x = 12 - 2 = 10 \]
\[ W + L = 12 + 10 = 22 \]

This satisfies the condition \( W + L = 22 \). Therefore, the team won 12 times.

First, we find the number of years Gene has been traveling:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trips he has taken:
\[ 11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ trips/year} = 44 \text{ trips} \]

According to the problem:
- The first time the alarm went off, it sounded \( x \) times.
- The second time, it sounded \( 3x \) times.
- The third time, it sounded \( \frac{3x}{2} \) times.

We need to find the total number of times the alarm sounded over the three times it went off. Therefore, we sum up the times it sounded each time:
\[ x + 3x + \frac{3x}{2} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1, 3, and 2 is 2. Converting each term:
\[ x = \frac{2x}{2} \]
\[ 3x = \frac{6x}{2} \]
\[ \frac{3x}{2} = \frac{3x}{2} \]

Now, we can add them together:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{6x}{2} + \frac{3x}{2} = \frac{2x + 6x + 3x}{2} = \frac{11x}{2} \]

We know from the problem that the first time the alarm went off, it sounded 4 times. Therefore:
\[ x = 4 \]

Substituting \( x = 4 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{11x}{2} = \frac{11 \times 4}{2} = \frac{44}{2} = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm has sounded is:

2. Together, they sold 88,000 copies.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ M = 10H \]
\[ M + H = 88000 \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 10H + H = 88000 \]
\[ 11H = 88000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

1. Calculate the number of invited friends who actually attend the party.
2. Determine the total number of gift bags needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of invited friends who attend the party.**

Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them do not attend. Therefore, the number of friends who do not attend is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of friends who attend the party is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of gift bags needed.**

Christina plans to give 0.75 gift bags per attending friend. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:

polymath-low-fr-90,"To determine how many kilograms of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- There are 20 adults.
- Each adult requires 10 pounds of potato salad.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:
  \[
  20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- There are 5 children.
- Each child requires half the amount of potato salad as an adult, which is:
  \[
  \frac{10 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds/child}
  \]
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:
  \[
  5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount required:
\[
200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since the question asks for the total amount in kilograms, we need to convert pounds to kilograms. We know that 1 pound is approximately 0.453592 kilograms. Therefore:
\[
225 \text{ pounds} \times 0.453592 \text{ kg/pound} \approx 102.14 \text{ kilograms}

- Let \( J \) be the age of Jackson.
- Let \( A \) be the age of Amy.
- Let \( C \) be the age of Corey.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of Jacques.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Jacques is 10 years old and 1 year less than Corey, so \( Q = 10 \) and \( C = Q + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \).
2. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so \( A = J + 5 \).
3. Amy is 2 years older than Corey, so \( A = C - 2 \).

Since we already know \( C = 11 \), we can substitute this into the equation for Amy's age:
\[ A = 11 - 2 = 9. \]
Now we know \( A = 9 \). We can use the equation \( A = J + 5 \) to find Jackson's age:
\[ 9 = J + 5. \]
Solving for \( J \), we get:

3. Calculate Gérald's original speed.
4. Determine Gérald's new speed after the 10% improvement.
5. Use Gérald's new speed to find his new time.

First, we know that Lee's new time for the 400 meters hurdles is 38 seconds. Since Lee was originally two seconds faster than Gérald, his original time was:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we calculate Gérald's original speed. Since Lee's original time was 40 seconds, Gérald's original time was 42 seconds. Therefore, Gérald's original speed is:
\[ \text{Speed of Gérald} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{42 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{200}{21} \text{ meters/second} \]

After the 10% improvement in his speed, Gérald's new speed is:
\[ \text{New speed of Gérald} = \left(1 + \frac{10}{100}\right) \times \frac{200}{21} = 1.1 \times \frac{200}{21} = \frac{220}{21} \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we calculate Gérald's new time using his new speed:
\[ \text{New time of Gérald} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{\frac{220}{21} \text{ meters/second}} = 400 \times \frac{21}{220} = \frac{8400}{220} = \frac{420}{11} \approx 38.18 \text{ seconds} \]

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of dogs and cats is 60.
2. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats.
3. For each dog, there are 2 cats.

First, we can express the total number of dogs and cats as:
\[ D + C = 60 \]

Next, the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats:
\[ R = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Since there are 2 cats for each dog, we can express the number of cats as:
\[ C = 2D \]

Now we substitute \( C = 2D \) into the first equation:
\[ D + 2D = 60 \]
\[ 3D = 60 \]
\[ D = 20 \]

So, the number of dogs \( D \) is 20. Now we can find the number of cats \( C \):
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

We already know the number of rabbits \( R \) is 48. To find the total number of animals in the quartier, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ D + C + R = 20 + 40 + 48 = 108 \]

3. Determine the number of girls who are members of the scouts.
4. Determine the number of girls who are not members of the scouts.

First, we calculate the number of boys in the class. Since 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we have:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls in the class. Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these girls are members of the scouts. Since 2/3 of the girls are members of the scouts, we have:
\[
\text{Number of girls who are members of the scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we need to find out how many girls are not members of the scouts. This is the total number of girls minus the number of girls who are members of the scouts:
\[
\text{Number of girls who are not members of the scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40

\[
\text{Hours Jacques slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

Next, we find out how many more hours Harry slept than Jacques by subtracting the number of hours Jacques slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars managed to move forward, and 5 cars left the line to avoid the bottleneck. Initially, there were 30 cars on the highway.

After the first 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining on the highway is:
\[ 30 - x \]

Then, 20 more cars move forward:
\[ (30 - x) - 20 = 10 - x \]

Finally, 5 cars leave the line:
\[ (10 - x) - 5 = 5 - x \]

Since the problem states that the number of cars that managed to move forward during the first 15 minutes is \( x \), and we know that after these movements, the number of cars left is 0 (assuming all cars that managed to move forward did so during the first 15 minutes and no cars remained after the movements), we can set up the equation:

polymath-low-fr-102,"Let's break down Jean's water drinking routine and calculate the total amount of water he drinks in a week.

1. **Daily Water Consumption:**
   - Jean drinks one glass of water at breakfast.
   - Jean drinks one glass of water at lunch.
   - Jean drinks one glass of water at dinner.
   - Therefore, Jean drinks 3 glasses of water each day.

2. **Weekly Water Consumption (Monday to Friday):**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - So, the total number of glasses of water Jean drinks from Monday to Friday is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) glasses.

3. **Weekend Water Consumption:**
   - On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), Jean drinks one soda at dinner instead of water.
   - Therefore, he drinks 0 glasses of water on Saturday and 0 glasses of water on Sunday.

4. **Total Weekly Water Consumption:**
   - Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends, Jean drinks \(15 + 0 + 0 = 15\) glasses of water in a week.

Thus, the total number of glasses of water Jean drinks in a week is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,26
polymath-low-fr-103,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the fog bank's coverage rate:**
   - The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total length of the city:**
   - The city extends over 42 miles.

3. **Calculate the time required to cover the entire city:**
   - Using the rate of coverage, we can find the time \( t \) required to cover 42 miles:
     \[
     t = \frac{\text{Total length of the city}}{\text{Rate of coverage}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     t = \frac{42}{0.3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

polymath-low-fr-106,"To determine the volume of the interior of each box, we first need to account for the thickness of the walls. Each box has a total outer dimension of 5 x 6 x 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick on each side. This means the interior dimensions are reduced by 2 inches on each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the interior dimensions of each box are:
\[ (5 - 2) \times (6 - 2) \times (4 - 2) = 3 \times 4 \times 2 \text{ inches} \]

The volume of one interior is:

polymath-low-fr-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV each day and then find the difference from the total time he watched TV.

First, let's calculate the time spent watching TV each day:

- **Lundi (Monday)**: 1 hour each night for 2 nights = 2 hours
- **Mardi (Tuesday)**: 1 hour each night for 2 nights = 2 hours
- **Mercredi (Wednesday)**: Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes as \( x \). Therefore, the time spent is \( \frac{x}{2} \) hours.
- **Jeudi (Thursday)**: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- **Vendredi (Friday)**: 2 hours each night for 2 nights = 4 hours

The total time spent watching TV over the week is given as 7 hours. Summing up the time spent each day, we get:

\[ 2 \text{ hours (Monday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + \frac{x}{2} \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (Thursday)} + 4 \text{ hours (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2 + 2 + \frac{x}{2} + 1.5 + 4 = 7 \]
\[ 9.5 + \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]

Subtract 9.5 from both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 7 - 9.5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = -2.5 \]

Since \(\frac{x}{2} = -2.5\) is not possible (as \(x\) must be a non-negative integer), we need to recheck the setup. The correct setup should be:

\[ 2 + 2 + \frac{x}{2} + 1.5 + 4 = 7 \]
\[ 9.5 + \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 7 - 9.5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 2.5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, Frankie watched 5 episodes of 30 minutes each on Wednesday. The number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,3
polymath-low-fr-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henri planned to make this year as \( x \). According to the problem, he wants to make two times more cookies than last year, so the number of cookies he planned to make last year is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

After baking, he made \( x + 15 \) cookies. However, he dropped 5 cookies and ended up with 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henri planned to make 100 cookies this year. Since he planned to make two times more cookies than last year, the number of cookies he made last year is:

\[ \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of cookies Henri prepared last year is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50

polymath-low-fr-111,"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the boat:**
   Julia took 16 seconds to cover 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to reach the shore:**
   The distance to the shore is 64 seconds. Using the speed calculated:
   \[
   \text{Time to reach the shore} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{1.25 \text{ feet/second}} = 51.2 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the distance the boat traveled in 51.2 feet:**
   Since the boat travels 20 feet in 16 seconds, we need to find out how many 20-foot segments are in 51.2 feet:
   \[

   \]

4. **Calculate the total time taken to travel 51.2 feet:**
   Each segment takes 16 seconds, so for 2.56 segments:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 2.56 \times 16 \text{ seconds} = 40.96 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of 10-foot intervals in 40.96 seconds:**

3. Use the information about the number of oiseaux to find out how many canards (ducks) are on the photo taken by Jamal.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos. Since Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, we can calculate the storage capacity of Brittany's phone as follows:
\[
\text{Storage capacity of Brittany's phone} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \text{ photos}
\]

Next, we know that Brittany's phone can store 50 times more photos than the number of oiseaux on the photo taken by Jamal. Let \( x \) be the number of oiseaux on the photo taken by Jamal. Then:
\[
\text{Storage capacity of Brittany's phone} = 50x
\]
We already calculated that the storage capacity of Brittany's phone is 300 photos, so:
\[
50x = 300
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{300}{50} = 6
\]
This means there are 6 oiseaux (birds) on the photo taken by Jamal. Since the photo shows canards (ducks), and we are not given any information that distinguishes between different types of birds, we can assume the oiseaux are canards. Therefore, the number of canards on the photo is:

- Sasha has 10 planches of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 planches} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Sasha also has 5 planches of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 planches} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- The total cost of all the wood is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the wood:
- Sasha plans to sell all the wood at the original price, which is $10 per planch
  \[
  \text{Revenue} = 10 \times 10 + 5 \times 16 = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}

   \[
   40,000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's initial salary}
   \]
   Solving for Lylah's initial salary:
   \[
   \text{Lylah's initial salary} = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23
