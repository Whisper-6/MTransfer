mgsm-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of blue ties John bought:**
   John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of each red tie:**
   Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Each blue tie costs $40.
   \[
   \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**
   John bought 10 red ties, each costing $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on ties:**
   Add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties.
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800
   \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800
mgsm-en-48,"To determine how many pieces of wire Tracy obtained, we need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches, since the length of each piece is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units is:

mgsm-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day and convert that to dozens.
2. Determine the revenue per day.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per day and convert to dozens.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can find the number of dozens produced per day by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:
\[
\frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the revenue per day.**

Lloyd sells the eggs at $2 per dozen. Therefore, the revenue per day is:
\[
21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly revenue.**

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly revenue is:
\[
42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}

Thus, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week.",294,294
mgsm-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back from his destination, we need to know the distance he traveled to get there. However, the problem does not specify the distance. Let's denote the distance from his starting point to the destination as \( d \) miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from his starting point to the destination. The speed of the ship is 10 miles per hour, so the time taken to travel \( d \) miles is:
\[ \text{Time to travel to the destination} = \frac{d}{10} \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to travel back from the destination. The speed on the return trip is 6 miles per hour, so the time taken to travel back \( d \) miles is:
\[ \text{Time to travel back} = \frac{d}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Since the distance \( d \) is the same for both trips, we can express the time it takes to travel back as:
\[ \text{Time to travel back} = \frac{d}{6} \]

Without the specific value of \( d \), we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the distance \( d \) is known, the time to travel back is simply \( \frac{d}{6} \) hours.

Since the problem does not provide the distance \( d \), the answer in terms of \( d \) is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{d}{6}} \]",6,5
mgsm-en-52,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he removes.

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:
\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

Therefore, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

mgsm-en-75,"To determine the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we need to first find the square footage of each level and then calculate the average.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels as follows:
- Level 4 (top level): \( S_4 = 16 \)
- Level 3: \( S_3 = 2 \times S_4 \)
- Level 2: \( S_2 = 2 \times S_3 \)
- Level 1: \( S_1 = 2 \times S_2 \)

First, calculate the square footage for each level:
- \( S_4 = 16 \)
- \( S_3 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
- \( S_2 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)
- \( S_1 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \)

Now, we have the square footage for all four levels:
- Level 1: 128
- Level 2: 64
- Level 3: 32
- Level 4: 16

To find the average square footage of a level, sum the square footages and divide by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4}{4} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4}
\]

Calculate the sum:
\[
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240
\]

Now, divide by 4:
\[
\frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:

mgsm-en-195,"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of one pen is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

So, one pen costs $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Thus, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00. Enclosing the final number, we get:

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.
2. Subtract the total amount distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find the amount that will not be used.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots distributed. Since each of the 40 restaurants receives 2 pounds of carrots, the total amount distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find the amount that will not be used:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is \(\boxed{120}\).",120,120

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month collection:**
   In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Second month collection:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Third month collection:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200

1. Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
2. Calculate the payment from each publisher.
3. Sum the payments from both publishers to find the total weekly payment.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

The total payment Mark receives in a week is the sum of the payments from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

2. Determine the required total sum of the six test scores to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score needed on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the required total sum.

First, let's calculate the sum of the scores of the first five tests:
\[89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}}\]
So, for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[93 = \frac{438 + x}{6}\]
where \(x\) is the score on the sixth test. To find \(x\), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 6:
\[93 \times 6 = 438 + x\]
\[558 = 438 + x\]
Then, we solve for \(x\) by subtracting 438 from both sides:
\[x = 558 - 438\]
\[x = 120\]

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

4. Determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn the additional money needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.**

The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine how much money Sara has initially and how much she earns from babysitting.**

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits. Since she babysits 4 times, she earns:

From the problem, we know the following:

1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had B + 16 gallons and the small pool had S + 16 gallons. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute for the last 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the big pool is B - 16 and in the small pool is S - 16. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ B = 4S - 48 \]

Now we have two equations for B:
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]
\[ B = 4S - 48 \]

We can set these two expressions for B equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S - 48 \]
\[ 16 + 48 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 64 = 2S \]
\[ S = 32 \]

3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}

mgsm-en-221,"To determine how many liters of water are left in the tank, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of water in the tank, which is 120 liters.
2. Subtract the amount of water Celine used to water her garden, which is 90 liters.
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
   So, after watering her garden, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank.
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:

2. Calculate the new total number of cards after the changes.
3. Determine the percentage of water type cards in the new total.

**Step 1: Calculate the new number of water type cards.**

James originally has 40 water type cards. After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new total number of cards.**

James originally has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. After buying 14 more grass type cards, the new counts are:

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original value of the house was $80,000, and Josh increased its value by 150%. The increase in value can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]
So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given to the entire flock in the morning and afternoon.
4. Subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed to find the amount given in the final meal.

First, let's find the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much feed one chicken gets in the morning and afternoon:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- In the morning, each chicken gets \(\frac{15}{20} = 0.75\) cups.
- In the afternoon, each chicken gets \(\frac{25}{20} = 1.25\) cups.
So, the total feed given to one chicken in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 0.75 + 1.25 = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we calculate the total feed given to the entire flock in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed given to the flock per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we find the amount of feed given in the final meal by subtracting the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed:

1. **Initial Drive:**
   John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, after 3 hours, John is 180 miles away from home.

2. **Traffic and Slow Drive:**
   John spends the next 2 hours in traffic, during which he does not make any progress towards home.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 0 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 0 \, \text{miles}

   So, after 5 hours (3 hours + 2 hours), John is still 180 miles away from home.

3. **Fast Drive:**
   John then drives at a speed of 30 mph for 0.5 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, after 5.5 hours (3 hours + 2 hours + 0.5 hours), John is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

4. **Final Drive:**
   John drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 3.5 hours.

mgsm-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

\[
\text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
\]

Next, we calculate the annual cost to water and feed the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we determine the net profit per year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:

\[
\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

Initially, Carlos has to pay $90 to plant the tree. We need to find the number of years \( n \) it takes for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost.

We set up the equation where the total net profit equals the initial cost:

\[
n \times \$7.5 = \$90
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
\]

Thus, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final number is \(\boxed{12}\).",12,13

2. After selling \(\frac{x}{3}\) vacuum cleaners, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which means she sold \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
5. After selling \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
6. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
7. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
8. Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
9. Then, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

**Step 1: Number of eggs per day**
Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. Therefore, she uses 3 eggs per day.

**Step 2: Number of eggs per week**
There are 7 days in a week. So, the number of eggs she uses in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 3: Number of eggs in 4 weeks**
To find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly consumption by 4:

Marissa has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in 1 hour

So, the total distance covered so far is:
\[4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles}\]

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is:
\[12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles}\]

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire trail to be 4 miles per hour. The average speed is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is 12 miles, and the total time she wants to achieve this average speed is:
\[4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles}\]

3. Determine the total amount of water after spilling one liter of the orange drink.
4. Calculate the total amount of the mixed drink.
5. Determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.**
The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.**
The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount of water after spilling one liter of the orange drink.**
Initially, there are \(\frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3}\) liters of water. After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of water becomes:
\[ \frac{47}{3} - 1 = \frac{47}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of the mixed drink.**
The total amount of the mixed drink after spilling one liter of the orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 5: Determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink.**
The ratio of water to the total drink is \(\frac{\frac{44}{3}}{24} = \frac{44}{3 \times 24} = \frac{44}{72} = \frac{11}{18}\). Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

mgsm-en-33,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,70

1. First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
   \[
   \text{Raymond's jewels} = 40
   \]

2. Next, we are told that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond's jewels} + 5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

3. Finally, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, the number of points he scored in the second 20 minutes is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both intervals to find the total number of points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\).",9,9
mgsm-en-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to cover the total number of yogurts Terry eats.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to cover the total number of yogurts Terry eats.**

Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.**

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 sets is:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his Lego sets.
2. Determine the total amount of money John spends on video games.
3. Use the remaining money to find out how many Lego sets he still has.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ Lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per Lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has \$5 left. Therefore, the remaining money can be calculated as:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Since John has \$35 left after buying the video games, and he started with \$195, the number of Lego sets he still has is:
\[ 13 - 0 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of Lego sets John still has is \(\boxed{13}\).",13,2
mgsm-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total running time John spends each week.
2. Determine the total distance he runs each week.
3. Use the total running time and total distance to find his average speed.

First, let's find the total running time John spends each week. John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on each of the other two days. So, the running time for the second and third days is:

\[ \text{Running time on the second day} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Running time on the third day} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total running time per week:

\[ \text{Total running time} = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles per week. To find his average speed, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:

\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John's average speed is:

mgsm-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her time spent running and walking, and then calculate the distance she covers during these periods.

First, we know that Dana skips at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since she skips at half the speed of her running speed, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and while walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} \]
Since her walking speed is the same as her skipping speed (3 miles per hour), the distance walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances covered while running and walking gives the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

mgsm-en-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories you have left for the day.
2. Determine how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the number of servings into grams.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories left for the day.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories left} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.**

Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. With 200 calories left, we need to find out how many servings this corresponds to.
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 3: Convert the number of servings into grams.**

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, each serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]
Therefore, 0.8 servings of chips is:
\[ 0.8 \times 60 = 48 \text{ grams} \]

The number of grams you can eat is $\boxed{48}$.",48,48

1. Calculate the total cost of making the candles.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of making the candles.**

Charlie needs 20 candles, and each candle requires 0.1 pounds of beeswax (since 10 candles per pound of beeswax). Therefore, for 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of the beeswax is $10.00.

The total cost is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$10.00 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.**

If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes 20 candles, the total revenue is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

3. Calculate the number of rabbits based on the given relationship between rabbits and the combined number of dogs and cats.
4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets.

Let's start with the number of dogs, which is given as 60.

Next, we know that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120. \]

Now, let's denote the number of rabbits as \( R \). According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can write the equation:
\[ R = (\text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats}) - 12. \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ R = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168. \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348. \]

mgsm-en-106,"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first find the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of a single box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions are:
     - Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
     - Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
     - Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The inner volume \(V\) of a box is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume \(V_{\text{total}}\) is:
     \[
     V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72
mgsm-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we start by calculating the total hours of TV he watched from Monday to Friday.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\). Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours (since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours).
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour of an episode and 0.5 hours of a 30-minute show, so that's \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1 hour each, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours of TV he watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours}\]

Combining the known hours:
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7\]
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5 to solve for \(x\):
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.",30,3
mgsm-en-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year. The number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50
mgsm-en-109,"To determine the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

First, the cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, the cashback is $0.20 per gallon. For 10 gallons, the total cashback is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Thus, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is:

First, let's calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups long.
- Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
  \[
  24 \times 2 = 48
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups long.
- Marcell's fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is:
  \[
  14 \times 3 = 42
  \]

Now, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups both ate together:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):

mgsm-en-111,"To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row:**
   Julia's shore is 64 seconds away. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the total distance by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{d \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
   \]
   Solving for \(d\):
   \[
   d = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the rate at which the boat takes on water:**
   The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   Since the boat takes 80 feet to row to the shore, the total amount of water taken on is:
   \[
   80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} = 16 \text{ liters}

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing Jamal's phone capacity by 6.
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

2. **Relate the number of photographs to the number of birds:**
   The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let \( B \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Then we have:

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,6
mgsm-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate her total cost and her total revenue from selling the lumber, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:
- She bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber at $10 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber at $16 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, her total cost is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells all 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber. The selling price per board is not given, but since the problem does not specify a different selling price, we assume she sells them at the same price as she bought them, which is $10 per board. The total revenue from these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also sells all 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber. The selling price per board is not given, but since the problem does not specify a different selling price, we assume she sells them at the same price as she bought them, which is $16 per board. The total revenue from these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, her total revenue is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}

Finally, her profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
180 - 180 = 0 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Since the total parts are 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total amount by 20:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]
This means that each part (whether it's sugar or water) is 6 units. Since the sugar part is 7 parts, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is:

   Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it was 30 percent higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary was 40 percent more than what he was making four years ago. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we need to find the rate of increase. Let \( r \) be the annual percentage increase in their salaries. Then:
   \[
   40000 \times (1 + r)^4 = 56000
   \]
   Solving for \( (1 + r)^4 \):
   \[
   (1 + r)^4 = \frac{56000}{40000} = 1.4
   \]
   Taking the fourth root of both sides:
   \[
   1 + r = \sqrt[4]{1.4} \approx 1.093

\[
\text{Distance at 10 mph} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left after running for 3 hours. Since she runs for a total of 7 hours, the remaining time is:

   A third of the elves quit. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit.

3. **Number of elves remaining after some quit:**
   Subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   Now, 40 elves remain.

4. **Elves who quit after kids kick their shins:**
   10 of the remaining elves quit. We subtract these from the current number of elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 elves are left.

The final number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30

1. Identify the expenditure in May.
2. Calculate the expenditure in June.
3. Add the expenditures from May and June to find the total.

Step 1: The expenditure in May is given as $500.

Step 2: The expenditure in June is $60 less than in May. Therefore, we calculate the expenditure in June as follows:
\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = \text{Expenditure in May} - 60 = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Step 3: To find the total expenditure for May and June, we add the expenditures from both months:
\[ \text{Total expenditure} = \text{Expenditure in May} + \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Thus, the total expenditure for those two months is \(\boxed{940}\).",940,940
mgsm-en-132,"To determine the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival, we need to calculate the tickets used for each type of ride and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the tickets Pam used:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster by Pam are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge by Pam are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Pam are \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster by Fred are \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge by Fred are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Fred are \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Finally, we sum the tickets used by Pam and Fred:
- The total tickets used by Pam and Fred are \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets.

Thus, the total number of tickets they used that day is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60
mgsm-en-133,"To determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we start by calculating the number of miles he walked on Tuesday. According to the problem, Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We can express this total as the sum of the miles walked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Let \( W \) represent the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday. Then we have:

\[ 4 + 24 + W = 41 \]

To find \( W \), we simplify the equation:

\[ 28 + W = 41 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:

\[ W = 41 - 28 \]
\[ W = 13 \]

Thus, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is \(\boxed{13}\).",13,13

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
- The first test had 75 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the first test is:
\[
\frac{75 \text{ questions}}{5 \text{ questions per hour}} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 15 \times 8 = 120 \text{ questions}
\]

Since the test only had 75 questions, the number of questions he completed on the first test is actually:
\[
75 \text{ questions}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
- The second test had 100 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the second test is:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ questions}}{5 \text{ questions per hour}} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ questions}

mgsm-en-140,"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars}
\]
\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4

Next, we need to find what percentage of the total cars are semi-automatic. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars, and then multiplying by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\%

mgsm-en-141,"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees, which is given as 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \), we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And we can find the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\).",400,400

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time each takes to travel their respective distances. The time taken is given by the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \).

- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Tim takes longer to travel the distance, he is the loser and Steve is the winner. The difference in their travel times is:

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:

mgsm-en-155,"To determine the total length of all the baked goods Bill bakes in a day, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good separately and then sum these lengths.

First, we calculate the total length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls every day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants every day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, we calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods:
- The total length is \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

Since we need the final answer in feet, we convert 3360 inches to feet by dividing by 12:
- \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods is \(\boxed{280}\).",280,280

First, let's calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Next, we sum the monthly requirements for all the apes:
\[
200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month}
\]

Since the zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
\[

mgsm-en-157,"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we start by calculating the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 50-yard line and back, which is a total distance of:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
She then runs 34 times to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total distance of:
\[ 34 \times 2 \times 80 = 34 \times 160 = 5440 \text{ yards} \]
So, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 200 + 5440 = 5640 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Kelly runs 5640 yards and Blake runs 3000 yards. The difference in the distance run is:
\[ 5640 - 3000 = 2640 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner runs $\\boxed{2640}$ yards farther than the loser.",2640,80

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's calculate the price after the first two months:
\[ \text{Price after 2 months} = 20 + 0.20 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Next, let's calculate the price after the next two months (4 months total):
\[ \text{Price after 4 months} = 24 + 0.20 \times 24 = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80 \]

Then, let's calculate the price after the next two months (6 months total):
\[ \text{Price after 6 months} = 28.80 + 0.20 \times 28.80 = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56 \]

We can see that the price after every two months increases by 20% of the current price. To generalize, after \(n\) two-month periods, the price can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Price after } 2n \text{ months} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^n = 20 \times 1.20^n \]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we substitute \(n = 18\) into the formula:
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 1.20^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.20^{18}\). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ 1.20^{18} \approx 10.4277 \]

Therefore, the price after 36 months is:
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.4277 \approx 208.554 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price after 36 months is $208.55. Enclosing the final number, we get:

- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are:
  \[
  10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours in the second week.
- Therefore, his earnings for the second week are:
  \[
  10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum his earnings from both weeks to find the total amount he earned:
\[
50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks is \(\boxed{130}\).",130,130

First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
mgsm-en-181,"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to establish the relationship between the number of red roses and white carnations, and then use that to find the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( w \).

According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4w \).

Additionally, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 200 = 5w \]

To find \( w \), we solve the equation:
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, the number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm is \(\boxed{160}\).",160,160

1. Identify Jan's current age:
   \[
   \text{Jan's current age} = 30
   \]

2. Determine Mark's current age. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \). Therefore, Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

3. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \). According to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \). So, half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \). Therefore, two years ago Mark's age was:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 19 + 2 = 21
   \]
   So, Mark's current age is 21.

4. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 members in the team.

\[
\text{Total time for the faster team} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}

mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is the ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, expressed as a percentage:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = 2
\]
To express this ratio as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Therefore, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:
\[

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of pieces of straw as follows:

\[ 3 \times 6r + 10 \times 5 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation step by step:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends on one dog per day.
2. Multiply that daily amount by the number of dogs to get the weekly total.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, we can calculate the total hours spent on all dogs per day as follows:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on the dogs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily total by 7:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

   Therefore, Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we can calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has as follows:

3. Determine the total amount of money John has after selling the Lego sets and buying the video games.
4. Use the information about the leftover money to find out how much money John had initially.
5. Subtract the number of video games he bought from the total number of Lego sets he originally had to find out how many Lego sets he still has.

Let's start with the first step:

1. John sells 13 Lego sets at $15 each.
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195
   \]
   So, John earns $195 from selling the Lego sets.

2. John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160
   \]
   So, John spends $160 on the video games.

3. John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   \[
   195 - 160 = 35
   \]
   So, the total amount of money John has left is $35.

4. The total amount of money John had initially is the sum of the money he earned from selling the Lego sets and the money he has left after buying the video games.
   \[
   195 + 5 = 200

1. Calculate the total running time John spends running in a week.
2. Determine the total distance he runs in a week.
3. Use the total distance and total time to find his average speed.

First, let's find the total running time John spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on each of the other two days. So, he runs \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours on each of the other two days. Therefore, the total running time is:
\[3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. To find his average speed, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:
\[\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}\]

So, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10
polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her time spent running, walking, and skipping, and then calculate the distance she covers in each activity.

First, we know that Dana skips at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since she skips at half the speed of her running speed, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. The total time is six hours, so the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

The distance she covers while skipping is:
\[ \text{Distance skipping} = \text{Skipping speed} \times \text{Time skipping} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding up all the distances, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} + \text{Distance skipping} = 12 + 16 + 6 = 34 \text{ miles} \]

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

Given that \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the building is occupied, we calculate the number of occupied units as follows:
\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:
\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30
\]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is $\boxed{30}$.",30,30

polymath-low-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back from his destination, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM.
2. Use the distance to find the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. The distance is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since Tom's speed is 10 miles per hour and he traveled for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM):
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Tom to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time required is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

First, we calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books:
\[
30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound per comic book} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight needs to be removed to reach a total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:
\[
15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many toys, each weighing \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, are required to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds. We set up the equation:
\[
\text{Number of toys} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Solving for the number of toys:
\[
\text{Number of toys} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \div \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys.",15,15
polymath-low-en-53,"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, each charged at $60.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each charged at $40.

First, calculate the revenue from truck tires:
\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60/\text{truck tire} = \$360 \]

Next, calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40/\text{car tire} = \$160 \]

Now, sum the revenues from both types of tires for Thursday:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each charged at $40.

Calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[ 12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40/\text{car tire} = \$480 \]

Since the mechanic did not repair any truck tires on Friday, the revenue is:
\[ \$0 \]

Now, compare the revenues from both days:
- Thursday: \$520
- Friday: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

polymath-low-en-75,"To determine the average square footage of each level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we start by identifying the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it:
- Level 3 (below level 4) has \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) square footage.
- Level 2 (below level 3) has \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) square footage.
- Level 1 (below level 2) has \( 2 \times 64 = 128 \) square footage.

Next, we calculate the total square footage of all 4 levels:
\[
16 + 32 + 64 + 128
\]

We add these values step by step:
\[
16 + 32 = 48
\]
\[
48 + 64 = 112
\]
\[
112 + 128 = 240
\]

The total square footage of all levels is 240.

To find the average square footage per level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels (4):
\[
\frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60

polymath-low-en-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both the original and the better price scenarios.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Since each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50, the number of packages needed to get 18 flowers is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Since each package of 2 flowers costs $1, the number of packages needed to get 18 flowers is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

The better price is buying the flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each. The savings is the difference between the original cost and the better cost:
- The original cost is $15.

2. **Mixing Pens**: Ram can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new pen. 

Let's break down the process:
- After using 5 pens, he has 20 pens left (25 - 5 = 20).
- He can now make 4 new pens from these 20 pens (20 / 5 = 4).
- After making these 4 new pens, he has 16 pens left (20 - 4 = 16).
- He can now make 3 new pens from these 16 pens (16 / 5 = 3).
- After making these 3 new pens, he has 13 pens left (16 - 3 = 13).
- He can now make 2 new pens from these 13 pens (13 / 5 = 2).
- After making these 2 new pens, he has 11 pens left (13 - 2 = 11).
- He can now make 1 new pen from these 11 pens (11 / 5 = 2 remainder 1).
- After making this 1 new pen, he has 10 pens left (11 - 1 = 10).
- He can now make 2 new pens from these 10 pens (10 / 5 = 2).

Now, let's sum up all the pens he has:

polymath-low-en-6,"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships.

1. Let the number of sheep in Seattle be denoted by \( S \).
   Given that \( S = 20 \).

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston, denoted by \( C \), can be calculated as:
   \[
   C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse, denoted by \( T \), can be calculated as:
   \[
   T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city:
   \[
   T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

Thus, the total number of sheep is \(\boxed{260}\).",260,260
polymath-low-en-7,"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into manageable steps.

1. Calculate the time taken to download the first 80 GB (40% of 200 GB):
   \[
   \text{Time for first 80 GB} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. During this time, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. So, after the restart, Carla has to start downloading the file again from the beginning.

3. After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (since she has already downloaded 80 GB and needs to download the remaining 120 GB):
   \[
   \text{Time for remaining 120 GB} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. The total time spent downloading the file is the sum of the time taken to download the first 80 GB, the time taken to restart, and the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is $\boxed{120}$.",120,160
polymath-low-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining = 4 hours - 3 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 0.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 0.5 hours = 40 miles.

Now, we sum the distances from all segments to find the total distance John has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 40 \text{ miles} = 235 \text{ miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[ 235 \text{ miles} - 180 \text{ miles} = 55 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final distance John is from home is \(\boxed{55}\).",55,45

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since Carlos has an initial cost to plant the tree of $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13

   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1

   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
The initial value of the jewelry is $5,000. The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%.
The future value of the jewelry is:
\[ 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
The initial value of the electronic gadgets is $8,000. The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%.

Marissa has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in another 1 hour

So, the total distance covered so far is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. The average speed is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. Let \( t \) be the time she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles. The total time spent hiking will be:
\[ 1 + 1 + t = 2 + t \text{ hours} \]

The average speed is given by:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{12}{2 + t} \]

We know the average speed should be 4 miles per hour, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{12}{2 + t} = 4 \]

To find \( t \), we solve the equation:
\[ 12 = 4(2 + t) \]
\[ 12 = 8 + 4t \]
\[ 12 - 8 = 4t \]
\[ 4 = 4t \]
\[ t = 1 \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour. Therefore, her speed for the remaining distance is:

**Step 3: Determine the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink after spilling one liter.**
After spilling one liter, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixed drink.**
The total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixed drink is the sum of the water from the remaining orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:

polymath-low-en-30,"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to determine Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. We calculate half of 80 as follows:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]
   Adding 20 to this, the second friend's guess is:
   \[
   40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. We calculate 25% of 80 as follows:
   \[
   0.25 \times 80 = 20
   \]
   Adding this to 80, the third friend's guess is:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the guesses of 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Sum of guesses} = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80

polymath-low-en-82,"To determine the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we start by calculating Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
\]

Substituting Grace's weight (125 pounds) into the equation, we get:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

First, we calculate \(4 \times 125\):

\[
4 \times 125 = 500

Next, we subtract 2 from 500:

\[
500 - 2 = 498
\]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds. Now, we need to find the combined weight of Grace and Alex:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adults will eat:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many 16 ounce cans of tomatoes were used, we divide the original volume of the tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam. Additionally, 5 cars exit the motorway during this period. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes is \( x + 20 - 5 = x + 15 \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After the cars drove through the traffic jam and some exited, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is:

Thus, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\).",500,500
polymath-low-en-105,"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by Cody and Amir together, we start by identifying how many cookies each person eats.

First, we know that Amir eats 5 cookies. According to the problem, Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Cody eats as follows:
\[
\text{Number of cookies Cody eats} = 3 \times \text{Number of cookies Amir eats} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

Next, we find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir by adding the number of cookies each person eats:
\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = \text{Number of cookies Cody eats} + \text{Number of cookies Amir eats} = 15 + 5 = 20

Thus, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir together is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
polymath-low-en-106,"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first calculate the inner dimensions of a single box and then find the inner volume of one box. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of a single box:**
   - Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick.
   - Therefore, the inner dimensions are:
     - Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
     - Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
     - Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The inner volume \(V\) of a box is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume \(V_{\text{total}}\) is:
     \[
     V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times V = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72
polymath-low-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

First, let's break down the hours Frankie watched TV each day:
- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each day, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\). Since each episode is 30 minutes, this is equivalent to \(0.5x\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, so that's \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Combining the known hours:
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5\]
So the equation simplifies to:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[0.5x = 7 - 5.5\]
\[0.5x = 1.5\]
\[x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3\]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The final answer is:
\[\boxed{3}\]",3,3
polymath-low-en-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Thus, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any discounts.
2. Determine the total cashback received for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

First, we calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas:
\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons of gas:
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas:
\[ \text{Total cost after cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is $\boxed{28}$.",28,28
polymath-low-en-110,"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate and then find the average, we start by calculating the number of roll-ups each person had.

First, we calculate the number of roll-ups Beatrice had:
\[
2 \text{ roll-ups wide} \times 24 \text{ roll-ups long} = 48 \text{ roll-ups}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of roll-ups Marcell had:
\[
3 \text{ roll-ups wide} \times 14 \text{ roll-ups long} = 42 \text{ roll-ups}
\]

Now, we find the total number of roll-ups both ate by adding the number of roll-ups Beatrice had to the number of roll-ups Marcell had:
\[
48 + 42 = 90 \text{ roll-ups}
\]

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):

Thus, the average number of roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
polymath-low-en-111,"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row:**
   The shore is 64 seconds away, and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the total distance to the shore is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the rate at which the boat takes on water:**
   The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
   \[
   \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   The total distance rowed is 80 feet. Therefore, the total amount of water taken on is:
   \[
   \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 16 \text{ liters}

polymath-low-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber:

- Sasha has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Sasha also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Each 2 x 4 x 10 board is sold for the same price as when Sasha bought it, which is $10.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Each 4 x 4 x 10 board is sold for the same price as when Sasha bought it, which is $16.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
  \[
  \text{Total revenue} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 180 - 180 = 0 \text{ dollars}

1. Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.**

The customs officer initially counted 2 containers, with each container containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles initially imported is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles imported on the second day.**

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Since there were initially 10 vehicles, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.**

Each container contains 5 vehicles. Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

polymath-low-en-119,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current salaries of Adrien and Lylah and then find their total salary four years later.

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000 and that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

Next, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We know that four years later, Adrien's salary was 40% more than what he was making four years ago. Therefore, his salary four years later is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we need to find her salary four years later. Let \( L' \) be Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, we have:
\[ L' = L \times 1.4 = \frac{400000}{13} \times 1.4 = \frac{560000}{13} \approx 43076.92 \]

Now, we can find the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:
\[ 56000 + \frac{560000}{13} = \frac{728000 + 560000}{13} = \frac{1288000}{13} = 99076.92 \]

First, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left after running for 3 hours. Since she runs for a total of 7 hours, the remaining time is:
