mgsm-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.
2. Determine the cost of one red tie.
3. Calculate the number of red ties John bought.
4. Compute the total cost of the red ties.
5. Sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total expenditure.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.**

John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

**Step 2: Determine the cost of one red tie.**

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of one red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of red ties John bought.**

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought 5 blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

**Step 4: Compute the total cost of the red ties.**

The total cost of the red ties is:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

**Step 5: Sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total expenditure.**

The total cost of the blue ties is $200, and the total cost of the red ties is $600. Therefore, the total expenditure is:
\[
\text{Total expenditure} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

The total length of the wire is 4 feet. Converting this to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire.",8,8
mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

According to the problem, 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

mgsm-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.**

If Lloyd sells eggs at $2 per dozen, then the weekly revenue is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week.",294,294
mgsm-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled to his destination. However, the problem does not specify the distance. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the distance from 1 to 4 PM is \(d\) miles. 

First, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The time \(t_1\) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t_1 = \frac{d}{10} \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time \(t_2\) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t_2 = \frac{d}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the round trip is the sum of \(t_1\) and \(t_2\):
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{d}{10} + \frac{d}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30. So we rewrite the fractions:
\[ \frac{d}{10} = \frac{3d}{30} \]
\[ \frac{d}{6} = \frac{5d}{30} \]

Adding these fractions gives:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = \frac{3d}{30} + \frac{5d}{30} = \frac{8d}{30} = \frac{4d}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not specify the distance \(d\), the time it takes Tom to get back is \(\boxed{\frac{4d}{15}}\) hours.",15,5
mgsm-en-52,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

mgsm-en-53,"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day separately and then compare the two.

**Revenue on Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- The total revenue on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

**Revenue on Friday:**

4. Find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Let's start with the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Total oranges} = 25 \]

Next, we know that 20% of the oranges are unripe. So, the number of unripe oranges is:
\[ \text{Unripe oranges} = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

We are also given that there are 2 sour oranges. So, the number of bad oranges is the sum of the unripe oranges and the sour oranges:
\[ \text{Bad oranges} = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Since the basket contains 25 oranges and 7 of them are bad, the number of good oranges is:

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year. Since there are 6 months in a half-year, and the service charges $140 per month, the cost for the first half of the year is:
\[
140 \times 6 = 840
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half of the year. Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half is:

mgsm-en-74,"To determine how much Artie will make, we first need to round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total revenue from each type of flower.

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Original price: $2.74
   - Rounding $2.74 to the nearest dollar: $3.00

2. **Petunias:**
   - Original price: $1.87
   - Rounding $1.87 to the nearest dollar: $2.00

3. **Begonias:**
   - Original price: $2.12
   - Rounding $2.12 to the nearest dollar: $2.00

Next, we calculate the revenue from each type of flower by multiplying the rounded price by the number of pots sold.

- **Marigolds:**
  \[
  12 \text{ pots} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pot} = \$36.00
  \]

- **Petunias:**
  \[
  9 \text{ pots} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pot} = \$18.00
  \]

- **Begonias:**
  \[
  17 \text{ pots} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pot} = \$34.00
  \]

Finally, we sum the revenues from all the flowers to find the total amount Artie will make:
\[
\$36.00 + \$18.00 + \$34.00 = \$88.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88}\).",88,88
mgsm-en-75,"To determine the average square footage of each level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to find the square footage of each individual level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels as follows:
- Level 4: \(16\)
- Level 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
- Level 2: \(32 \times 2 = 64\)
- Level 1: \(64 \times 2 = 128\)

Next, we sum the square footages of all four levels:
\[
16 + 32 + 64 + 128
\]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:
\[
16 + 32 = 48
\]
\[
48 + 64 = 112
\]
\[
112 + 128 = 240
\]

Now, we find the average square footage by dividing the total sum by the number of levels (which is 4):
\[
\frac{240}{4} = 60
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60
mgsm-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the rest of the puppy's life.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:**
   The puppy is fed 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   \[
   \text{Amount of dog food in the first 180 days} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of dog food used in the rest of the puppy's life:**
   The rest of the puppy's life is not specified, but we only need to consider the first year. Assuming the rest of the puppy's life is more than a year, we will calculate the dog food needed for the first year only.
   The puppy is fed 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the year (365 days).
   \[
   \text{Amount of dog food in the rest of the year} = 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 365 \text{ days} = 730 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of dog food used in the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount of dog food in the first year} = 180 \text{ cups} + 730 \text{ cups} = 910 \text{ cups}

4. **Determine the number of bags of dog food needed:**
   Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \left\lceil \frac{910 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 8.2727 \right\rceil = 9

1. First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2:

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs to determine the better price:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The better price is $9.

To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we subtract the better price from the original price:

- Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
- Let \( J_m \) be James's age, which is given as 10.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has. Violetta has $20, so the change she will get is:

1. Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
2. Calculate the payment from each publisher.
3. Sum the payments from both publishers to find the total weekly earnings.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits:
\[
\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A}
\]
\[
500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B}
\]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[
500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
\]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
\[
2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
\]
Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[
500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
\]

Adding the payments from both publishers gives the total weekly earnings:
\[

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[
25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams}
\]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:

4. Determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to save the additional amount of money.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.**
The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine how much money Sara will have after babysitting.**
Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns:

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. Then we can write the equation:

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago can be expressed as follows:

- The big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.
- The small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

By substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ 4S = 2S + 16 \]
Subtracting \( 2S \) from both sides, we get:

3. Find the average of their ages in three years.

First, we know Harriet's current age is 21 years. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Next, since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can find Adrian's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we calculate their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66
\]
\[
\text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24

\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate Brianna's points:
\[ B = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ N = 68, \quad Y = 44, \quad B = 85 \]

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is:
\[ N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, the points scored by Jojo, \( J \), can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ J = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points.",54,54
mgsm-en-220,"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles over the weekend, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle separately and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}

1. Calculate the new number of water type cards after losing 8 cards.
2. Calculate the total number of cards after the changes.
3. Determine the percentage of water type cards out of the total number of cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

After buying 14 grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

The total number of cards now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

The total number of coins is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
S + (S + 30) = 110

So, John earns $195 from selling his Lego sets.

Next, let's determine the total amount of money John spends on video games. John buys 8 video games for $20 each:
\[

polymath-low-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to find out the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. Let's denote the time he runs on the first day as \( t \) hours. According to the problem, he runs \( t \) hours on the first day and \( \frac{t}{2} \) hours on each of the other two days. Therefore, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[ t + \frac{t}{2} + \frac{t}{2} = t + t = 2t \text{ hours} \]

We also know that the distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Since he runs \( t \) hours on the first day and \( \frac{t}{2} \) hours on each of the other two days, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ t \cdot v + \frac{t}{2} \cdot v + \frac{t}{2} \cdot v = t \cdot v + t \cdot v = 2t \cdot v \]
where \( v \) is his running speed in miles per hour. Since the total distance is 60 miles, we have:
\[ 2t \cdot v = 60 \]
\[ t \cdot v = 30 \]

To find \( v \), we need to determine \( t \). Since the total time spent running in a week is 2t hours, and we don't have additional information to find \( t \) directly, we can use the relationship \( t \cdot v = 30 \) to find \( v \). From the equation \( t \cdot v = 30 \), we can express \( v \) as:
\[ v = \frac{30}{t} \]

Since the total time \( 2t \) is the sum of the time spent running each day, and we know the total distance is 60 miles, we can use the relationship directly to find the speed. The speed \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{60}{2t} = \frac{30}{t} \]

Given that the total time \( 2t \) is the sum of the time spent running each day, and we know the total distance is 60 miles, we can use the relationship directly to find the speed. The speed \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{60}{2t} = \frac{30}{t} \]

Since the total time \( 2t \) is the sum of the time spent running each day, and we know the total distance is 60 miles, we can use the relationship directly to find the speed. The speed \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{60}{2t} = \frac{30}{t} \]

Given that \( t \cdot v = 30 \), and the total time is 2t, we can find:
\[ v = \frac{30}{t} \]

Since \( t \cdot v = 30 \), and the total time is 2t, we can find:
\[ v = \frac{30}{t} = \frac{30}{1} = 5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her time spent running and walking and then calculate the distance she covers during each activity.

First, we know that Dana skips at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Since she skips at half the speed of her running speed, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and while walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} \]
Since her walking speed is the same as her skipping speed, which is 3 miles per hour, the distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

polymath-low-en-41,"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Calculate how far outside the dragon's reach this distance is.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when not holding the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin is \(\boxed{200}\).",200,200

polymath-low-en-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories you can still consume.
2. Determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the number of servings into grams.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories you can still consume.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.**

Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving.
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 3: Convert the number of servings into grams.**

Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag of chips, each serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams per serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]",48,48

polymath-low-en-53,"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60. Therefore, the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40. Therefore, the revenue from car tires is:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total revenue for Thursday is:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total revenue for Friday is:
  \[
  0 + 480 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we compare the revenues from Thursday and Friday:
- Revenue on Thursday: $520
- Revenue on Friday: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:

1. The square footage of the top level (level 4) is given as 16.
2. The square footage of the third level (level 3) is half of the top level, so it is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
3. The square footage of the second level (level 2) is half of the third level, so it is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).
4. The square footage of the first level (level 1) is half of the second level, so it is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

Now we have the square footage of each level: 16, 8, 4, and 2. To find the average square footage of a level, we sum these values and divide by the number of levels.

The sum of the square footages is:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[
1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days left is:
\[
365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days}
\]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will need 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[
2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.00.

The better price is buying the flowers in packages of 2, and the savings is:

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
- Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
- Let \( J_m \) be James's age, which is given as 10.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \).
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \).
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( J_m = C - 1 \).
4. James's age is 10: \( J_m = 10 \).

Using the fourth piece of information, we can find Corey's age:
\[ J_m = C - 1 \implies 10 = C - 1 \implies C = 11. \]

Now that we know Corey's age is 11, we can find Amy's age using the second relationship:
\[ A = C - 2 \implies A = 11 - 2 \implies A = 9. \]

Next, we use the first relationship to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \implies 9 = J + 5 \implies J = 4. \]

Thus, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old.",4,4

1. Determine Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Use Lee's original time to find Gerald's original time.
3. Calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improvement.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find Gerald's new time after his speed improvement. The problem states that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. This means his new time is 90% of his original time. So, we calculate Gerald's new time as follows:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds.",36,36
polymath-low-en-94,"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of dogs.
2. Use the ratio of cats to dogs to find the number of cats.
3. Use the relationship between the number of rabbits and the combined number of dogs and cats to find the number of rabbits.
4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets.

Let's start with the given information:
- The number of dogs is 60.
- The number of cats is twice the number of dogs (since there are two cats for every dog).
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
\text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

Now, calculate the number of rabbits:
\[
\text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Finally, sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

1. Calculate the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.
2. Determine the number of girls in the girl scout.
3. Find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boys and girls.**

The total number of students is 200. Since \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the students are boys, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]
Therefore, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of girls in the girl scout.**

We are given that \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

**Step 3: Find the number of girls not in the girl scout.**

The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout:

2. Find the difference between the number of hours Harry slept and the number of hours James slept.

First, we know that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. Therefore, we calculate the number of hours James slept as follows:
\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

Next, we find the difference between the number of hours Harry slept and the number of hours James slept:

polymath-low-en-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume of tomatoes before cooking.

First, we know that Freda's tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16 ounce cans of tomatoes were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

polymath-low-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that left the motorway due to the traffic jam is \( x + 20 - 5 = x + 15 \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After the traffic jam, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is:
\[ 30 - (x + 15) = 30 - x - 15 = 15 - x. \]

Since the problem does not specify the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the traffic jam, we can infer that the number of cars remaining on the motorway must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, we need to ensure that \( 15 - x \geq 0 \), which implies \( x \leq 15 \).

To find the specific value of \( x \), we can use the fact that the total number of cars that left the motorway is \( x + 15 \). Since the problem does not provide additional constraints, we can assume the simplest scenario where the number of cars remaining on the motorway is zero, which means:
\[ 15 - x = 0 \implies x = 15. \]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{15} \).",15,5

2. Determine the number of potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we calculate the number of potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(\boxed{40}\).",40,58

First, we know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. Let's denote the number of rings the fourth friend pressed as \( R_4 = 60 \).

Next, we need to find out how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell. According to the problem, the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the number of rings the third friend pressed is:
\[ R_3 = R_4 + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. The second friend pressed the doorbell \(\frac{1}{4}\) times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. Therefore, the number of rings the second friend pressed is:
\[ R_2 = 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Finally, we need to find out how many times the first friend pressed the doorbell, which is given as 20 times. Therefore, the number of rings the first friend pressed is:
\[ R_1 = 20 \]

Now, we sum up all the rings:
\[ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

polymath-low-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends separately.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with each meal: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- He also drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, for each weekday, he drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner and 1 glass of water before bed.

So, for each weekend day, he drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is:
\[ 2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the entire week:

The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. According to the problem, the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, we can find out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city by dividing 42 by 3:

\[
\frac{42}{3} = 14
\]

This means the fog bank needs to cover 14 segments of 3 miles each. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time required to cover the entire city is:

4. Determine the number of pieces remaining after her mom places her pieces.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board. Therefore, the number of pieces Poppy places is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, after Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750

2. Her mom then places a third of the remaining 750 pieces on the board. Therefore, the number of pieces her mom places is:
   \[
   \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]
   So, after her mom places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of a single box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions are reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Therefore, the inner dimensions are:
     \[
     (5 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (6 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (4 - 2) \text{ inches} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches}

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The inner volume \( V \) of a single box is given by the product of its inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) is:
     \[
     V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 72 \text{ cubic inches}

First, let's break down the hours watched each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's sum these hours:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each episode is 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 2 \text{ episodes} \]

polymath-low-en-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2x = x + 15 \). This simplifies to \( x = 15 \).

Now, we know that Henry actually baked \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \). According to the problem, he now has a total of 110 cookies. This means that the number of cookies he intended to bake last year, which is \( x \), must be the number of cookies he actually baked minus the 15 extra cookies he baked, plus the 5 cookies he dropped, and the 110 cookies he has now. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x - 15 + 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2x - 10 = 110 \]

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

\[ 2x = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ x = 60 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{60} \).",60,50

Next, we calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. Since his roll is 14 roll-ups long and 3 roll-ups wide, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[
14 \times 3 = 42
\]

Now, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice by adding the two amounts together:
\[
48 + 42 = 90

   Julia's shore was 64 seconds away. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the total distance she rowed by dividing the total time by the time it takes to row 20 feet:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 64 \times \frac{20}{16} = 64 \times 1.25 = 80 \text{ feet}

1. **Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing Jamal's phone capacity by 6:
   \[
   \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

2. **Relate the number of photographs to the number of birds:**
   The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let \( x \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Then the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times \( x \):

The total cost for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of the leftover lumber:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber. Since the problem does not specify the selling price per board, we assume she sells each board at the same price as she bought them, which is the same as the cost price (since the problem does not mention any change in price).

The total revenue is:
\[ 10 \times 10 + 5 \times 16 = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

First, let's calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported. There were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that after the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
polymath-low-en-119,"To determine the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Determine Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Determine Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Calculate the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L \times 1.30 \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Determine Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than his salary four years ago. So, his salary four years later is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Determine Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, her salary four years later is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

The total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (if necessary, but in this case, the exact value is sufficient), the total salary is:

2. Use the relationship between the number of dogs and cats to find the number of cats.
3. Calculate the number of rabbits.
4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets.

Given:
- The number of dogs is 60.
- The number of cats is twice the number of dogs.
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[
\text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
\]

Then, calculate the number of rabbits:
\[
\text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
\]

Finally, calculate the total number of pets:
\[
\text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

2. Calculate the number of girls who are in the girl scout.
3. Find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls.**

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]
Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of girls who are in the girl scout.**

According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

**Step 3: Find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout.**

The number of girls who are not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls who are in the girl scout:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide 64 by 16:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

mgsm-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is 20. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that left the motorway (either through the traffic jam or by taking an exit) is \( x + 20 + 5 = x + 25 \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After some cars drove through the traffic jam and some took an exit, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is \( 30 - (x + 25) = 5 - x \).

Since the number of cars remaining on the motorway must be a non-negative integer, we have:
\[ 5 - x \geq 0 \]
\[ x \leq 5 \]

Additionally, \( x \) must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the possible values for \( x \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, since 5 cars took an exit, \( x \) must be less than 5. So, the possible values for \( x \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to check which of these values satisfy the conditions of the problem.

If \( x = 0 \):
- Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes: 0
- Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
- Cars that took an exit: 5
- Total cars that left: 0 + 20 + 5 = 25
- Cars remaining: 30 - 25 = 5
- This is consistent with the problem statement.

If \( x = 1 \):
- Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes: 1
- Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
- Cars that took an exit: 5
- Total cars that left: 1 + 20 + 5 = 26
- Cars remaining: 30 - 26 = 4
- This is not consistent with the problem statement because the number of cars remaining should be 5.

If \( x = 2 \):
- Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes: 2
- Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
- Cars that took an exit: 5
- Total cars that left: 2 + 20 + 5 = 27
- Cars remaining: 30 - 27 = 3
- This is not consistent with the problem statement because the number of cars remaining should be 5.

If \( x = 3 \):
- Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes: 3
- Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
- Cars that took an exit: 5
- Total cars that left: 3 + 20 + 5 = 28
- Cars remaining: 30 - 28 = 2
- This is not consistent with the problem statement because the number of cars remaining should be 5.

If \( x = 4 \):
- Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes: 4
- Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20
- Cars that took an exit: 5
- Total cars that left: 4 + 20 + 5 = 29

   So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 70 times.
   \[
   \text{Rings from the third friend} = 70

- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on each weekday, John drinks:

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions are reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Therefore, the inner dimensions are \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches by \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches by \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches.

- Wednesday: Let's say he watched \( x \) 30-minute episodes, which is equivalent to \( \frac{x}{2} \) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour (1-hour episode) + 0.5 hours (30-minute episode) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours (2 episodes of 1 hour each)

Now, we sum up the hours of TV watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 1 + 1 + \frac{x}{2} + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ 5.5 + \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]

To isolate \( x \), subtract 5.5 from both sides:

mgsm-en-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry actually baked twice as many cookies as he intended, plus an additional 15 cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any discounts.
2. Calculate the total cashback reward for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback reward from the total cost of the gas.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any discounts:
\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback reward for 10 gallons of gas. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon:
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback reward from the total cost of the gas:
\[ \text{Total cost after cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is:

mgsm-en-110,"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

First, we calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate. Since her roll is 24 roll-ups long and 2 roll-ups wide, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[
24 \times 2 = 48
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. Since his roll is 14 roll-ups long and 3 roll-ups wide, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[
14 \times 3 = 42
\]

Now, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice by adding the two amounts together:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:

mgsm-en-111,"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the speed at which Julia rows.
2. Determine the total distance Julia rows.
3. Calculate the total amount of water the boat takes on.

**Step 1: Calculate the speed at which Julia rows.**

Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total distance Julia rows.**

The shore is 64 seconds away. Using her speed, the total distance is:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water the boat takes on.**

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. Therefore, the total amount of water taken on is:
\[
\text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing Jamal's phone capacity by 6.
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

2. **Relate the number of photographs to the number of birds:**
   The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let \( b \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Then we have:
   \[
   300 = 50b
   \]
   To find \( b \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 50:
   \[
   b = \frac{300}{50} = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,6
mgsm-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate her total cost and her total revenue from selling the lumber, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she has:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
  \]
- She also has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80
  \]
- Therefore, her total cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells all 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber at the original price of $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
  \]
- She sells all 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber at the original price of $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80
  \]
- Therefore, her total revenue is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Finally, to find her profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$180 - \$180 = \$0

mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Since the total number of parts is 20, each part corresponds to \(\frac{120}{20} = 6\) teaspoons. Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is the number of parts of sugar, which is 7. Since each part is 6 teaspoons, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar is \(7 \times 6 = 42\).

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L \times 1.30 \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago. Therefore, his salary four years later is:

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we can convert the time into hours:
\[ 24 \text{ minutes} = \frac{24}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \]
So, the total number of patient hours per day is:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 0.4 \text{ hours/patient} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital. The hospital charges $200 per hour for each patient visit, so the total revenue per day is:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost Josh incurred.
3. Subtract the total cost from the final value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and Josh spent $50,000 on repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. The increase in value is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:

\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred. This includes the original price of the house and the cost of the repairs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:

2. Determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon for the entire flock.
3. Subtract this amount from the total daily feed to find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

First, let's find out how much feed is given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of feed given to the entire flock in the morning and afternoon. Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed for the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal. Since the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups and this is for the entire flock, the amount of feed left for the final meal is the total daily feed minus the feed given in the morning and afternoon. The total daily feed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

So, the amount of feed left for the final meal is:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

\[
\text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
\]

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

\[
\text{Annual cost} = \$3/\text{year}
\]

Now, we find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:

\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

Initially, Carlos has to pay $90 to plant the tree. We need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \( n \) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:

\[
\text{Total net profit after } n \text{ years} = n \times \$7.5
\]

We set this equal to the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[
n \times \$7.5 = \$90

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13

3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. After selling at the red house, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
5. After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).
6. We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

The number of hours she works in a year as a teacher is:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 1750 \text{ hours/year} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 1750 \text{ hours/year} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 35000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- Jill works 15 hours per week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

The number of hours she works in a year as a coach is:

mgsm-en-25,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered except for the pizza boxes. We know the following:

- The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
- The cost of one pack of milk is $3, and she ordered 5 packs, so the total cost for the milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- The cost of one apple is $1.50, and she ordered 4 apples, so the total cost for the apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.
- Let \(x\) be the number of boxes of pizza she ordered. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza boxes is \(8.50x\) dollars.

The total amount Marie paid is $50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[
12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50
\]

First, we simplify the left side of the equation by adding the known costs:

\[
33 + 8.50x = 50
\]

Next, we isolate the term with \(x\) by subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation:

\[
8.50x = 17

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, which means we can express their ages as \(7x\) and \(11x\) respectively, where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
18x = 162
\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9

- The second friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
  \[
  \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):

First, we find out how long Dana spends running and walking in six hours. Since she spends one-third of the time running, the time spent running is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
The remaining time is spent walking, which is:
\[
6 - 2 = 4 \text{ hours}

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin is:

mgsm-en-42,"To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pie pieces initially available.
2. Subtract the number of remaining pie pieces from the total number of pie pieces to find out how many pieces were taken.

First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that after the guests had eaten, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
mgsm-en-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories you can consume in a day.
2. Determine how many calories are left for you to consume.
3. Calculate how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.
4. Determine how many grams of chips you can eat based on the number of servings.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories you can consume in a day.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many calories are left for you to consume.**

You have 200 calories left to consume.

**Step 3: Calculate how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.**

Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many grams of chips you can eat based on the number of servings.**

Since each serving is 5 grams, the number of grams you can eat is:
\[ 0.8 \times 5 = 4 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,48
mgsm-en-44,"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of making the candles.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 20 candles, and each candle requires 0.1 pounds of beeswax (since 20 candles / 200 candles per pound = 0.1 pounds per candle). The cost of beeswax per pound is $10.00, and the cost of wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 100 + 10 = 110 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total revenue from selling the candles. If each candle is sold for $2.00, then the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Net profit} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 110 \text{ dollars} = -70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is \boxed{-70}.",-70,20

1. Calculate the number of articles written on each day.
2. Determine the total number of hours spent writing articles each day.
3. Sum the total hours spent over the three days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours spent writing articles each day.**

- **Monday:** She spent \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) hours writing articles.
- **Tuesday:** She spent \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \) hours writing articles.
- **Wednesday:** She spent \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) hours writing articles.

**Step 3: Sum the total hours spent over the three days.**

mgsm-en-46,"Candice initially had 80 post-it notes. She ended up with 23 post-it notes remaining after placing one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. 

To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to calculate the total number of post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package and subtract the number of post-it notes she had left. 

So, the calculation is as follows:
\[ \text{Total post-it notes before purchasing} = \text{Initial post-it notes} + \text{Post-it notes purchased} \]
\[ 80 + \text{Post-it notes purchased} = 220 + 23 \]
\[ \text{Post-it notes purchased} = 220 + 23 - 80 \]
\[ \text{Post-it notes purchased} = 243 - 80 \]
\[ \text{Post-it notes purchased} = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is $\boxed{163}$.",163,163
mgsm-en-141,"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ B = 2Q \]
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\).",400,400

- Roach traps: 4 dollars

The total cost of nonfood items is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more potential clients, so the total number of clients is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of the bleach and cloths for all the clients. Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of one pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the cost for one client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since there are 8 clients, the total cost for all the clients is:

First, we know that John can harvest pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvest cycles in a year is:
\[
\frac{12}{3} = 4
\]
This means John can harvest 4 times in a year. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, the number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year is:
\[
100 \times 4 = 400
\]
John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, so the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:

mgsm-en-147,"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of bees that leave the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Bees that leave in the first 6 hours} = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of bees that return in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return in the next 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Bees that return in the next 6 hours} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of bees that leave in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours as the number that left in the first 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Bees that leave in the next 6 hours} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of bees that are still in the hive after the first two 6-hour periods:**
   After the first 6 hours, 30 bees have left. After the next 6 hours, 15 bees have returned. So, the number of bees remaining in the hive after the first two 6-hour periods is:
   \[
   \text{Bees remaining after first two 6 hours} = 30 - 15 = 15
   \]
   After the next 6 hours, 60 bees have left. So, the number of bees remaining in the hive after the first four 6-hour periods is:
   \[
   \text{Bees remaining after first four 6 hours} = 15 - 60 = -45
   \]
   Since the number of bees cannot be negative, this means all the bees that were initially in the hive have left by the end of the first four 6-hour periods. Therefore, no bees are left in the hive at the start of the last 6 hours.

5. **Calculate the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that returns to the hive. Since 60 bees left in the first 6 hours and 30 bees left in the next 6 hours, the total number of bees that left is:
   \[
   \text{Total bees that left} = 60 + 30 = 90
   \]
   Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 90.

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received:
- The total cost of the tickets is $22.
- The change she received is $8.
- Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is:

1. Identify the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
2. Use the number of friends Dorothy has to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Number of friends Charlie has} = 3 \times \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} \]

To find the number of friends Dorothy has, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of friends James has} = 4 \times \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} \]
\[ \text{Number of friends James has} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, the number of Facebook friends James has is \(\boxed{16}\).",16,16

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance. Time is calculated using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \).

For Steve:
\[
\text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = \frac{15840}{440} = 36 \text{ minutes}

For Tim:
\[
\text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = \frac{10560}{264} = 40 \text{ minutes}

Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes, and Tim finishes in 40 minutes. The difference in their times is:
\[

\[ 5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires} \]
The cost to inflate all these tires is:
\[ 10 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 250 \text{ cents} \]
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the cost in dollars is:
\[ 250 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 2.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 3 people came with tricycles, so the total number of tricycle tires is:
\[ 3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires} \]
The cost to inflate all these tires is:
\[ 9 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 225 \text{ cents} \]
The cost in dollars is:
\[ 225 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 2.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 1 person came with a unicycle, so the total number of unicycle tires is:
\[ 1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire} \]
The cost to inflate this tire is:
\[ 1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents} \]
The cost in dollars is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 0.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs from all the vehicles:
\[ 2.50 \text{ dollars} + 2.25 \text{ dollars} + 0.25 \text{ dollars} = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull stole the pack, and then Dave ate half of what he had left, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, after the seagull, Dave had \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) fries left.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Thus, after the pigeons, Dave had \( 7 - 9 = -2 \) fries left, which is not possible, indicating an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Let's recheck the problem constraints and logical flow.

Since the problem states that after the pigeons, there were 5 fries left, we can infer that the pigeons must have eaten more than 9 fries, but the problem setup suggests a logical error in the interpretation. Let's assume the problem meant Dave had 5 fries left after the pigeons, and the pigeons ate the rest.

So, let's reframe the problem:
- Dave ate 14 fries.
- The seagull stole the pack, and Dave ate 7 fries, leaving 7 fries.
- The pigeons ate 5 fries, leaving 2 fries.
- The raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 2 = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \) fries, which means it ate 1 fry (since we can't have a fraction of a fry in this context).
- The raccoon left 1 fry.
- The ant then ate the last fry, leaving 0 fries.

This setup is consistent with the problem's final statement that 5 fries were left before the ant ate the last one.

So, the initial number of fries \( x \) is the sum of the fries eaten and left:
\[ x = 14 + 7 + 5 = 26 \]

Thus, the initial number of fries in the pack is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,48

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from the weekdays and the weekend days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:

- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants every day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods:
- The total length is \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we use the fact that there are 12 inches in a foot:

15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 50-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. She then runs back and forth 34 times to the 40-yard line and back. Each round trip to the 40-yard line is \(100 + 60 = 160\) yards. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[
200 + 34 \times 160 = 200 + 5440 = 5640 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Kelly runs 5640 yards and Blake runs 3000 yards. The difference in the distance run is:
\[
5640 - 3000 = 2640 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner (Kelly) runs \(\boxed{2640}\) yards farther than the loser (Blake).",2640,80

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]
So, the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The price after each two-month period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, where the original price is the principal and the increase rate is the interest rate. The price after \( n \) two-month periods is given by:
\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( P_0 = 20 \) is the original price, \( r = 0.20 \) is the rate of increase, and \( n = 18 \) is the number of two-month periods.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.53 \]

Therefore, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 10.53 = 210.60 \]

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{210.60}\).",60,92

First, we know that Jan is 30 years old. Let's denote Jan's current age as \( J \). So, \( J = 30 \).

Next, we know that two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's current age. Let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \). Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \). According to the problem, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's current age. So we can write the equation:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 - 5 \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ M - 2 = 15 - 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 10 \]
Adding 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ M = 12 \]
So, Mark is currently 12 years old.

We are also given that Jean is two years older than Mark. Let's denote Jean's current age as \( J_e \). Therefore:
\[ J_e = M + 2 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ J_e = 12 + 2 \]
\[ J_e = 14 \]
So, Jean is 14 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]",14,23
mgsm-en-183,"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 400 meter relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member of the faster team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Since there are 4 members, the total time for the faster team is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- The total time for the slower team is:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the total times:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds.",2,2
mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even on second roll} \mid \text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number greater than 3})}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = 2
\]
This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

First, we know that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples. According to the problem, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
\[
\text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Next, we find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother by adding the number of apples each picked:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-en-186,"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided.

First, let's define the number of rats as \( r \). Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is \( \frac{r}{3} \). Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 6r \).

Next, we know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Let \( h \) be the total number of hamsters. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 5h \).

Additionally, there is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 6r + 5h + 20 = 160 \]

We need to find the value of \( r \). To do this, we need to express \( h \) in terms of \( r \) or find a value of \( r \) that satisfies the equation. First, let's isolate \( 5h \):
\[ 6r + 20 + 5h = 160 \]
\[ 6r + 5h = 140 \]

Since \( h \) must be a whole number, \( 6r \) must be such that \( 140 - 6r \) is a multiple of 5. Let's check the possible values of \( r \):

If \( r = 20 \):
\[ 6(20) + 5h = 140 \]
\[ 120 + 5h = 140 \]
\[ 5h = 20 \]
\[ h = 4 \]

This is a valid solution. Now, we need to find the number of rats in each cage. Since there are 20 rats in total and they are kept in 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \frac{20}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \]

However, since the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number, and we have verified that \( r = 20 \) is the only solution that fits the equation, we can conclude that the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]",6,5

   Mike stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}

3. **Letters sent and received per week:**
   Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:
   \[
   2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week}

On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and twice as many on Tuesday, we have:

On Monday, Sue ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

Now, we sum the cookies eaten by Sue over the two days:

polymath-low-en-2,"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the final value of the house.

First, let's find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. The increase in value is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]
So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house after the repairs. The total cost is the original value plus the cost of the repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, the profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

polymath-low-en-4,"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
2. Determine the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock for one meal.
3. Subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount needed for the entire flock.

First, let's find the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ \text{Morning feed} = 15 \text{ cups} \]
\[ \text{Afternoon feed} = 25 \text{ cups} \]
\[ \text{Total feed for morning and afternoon} = 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock for one meal. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal, for 20 chickens:
\[ \text{Total feed needed for one meal} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount needed for the entire flock:
\[ \text{Feed needed in the final meal} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20

polymath-low-en-6,"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep in Seattle.

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[
\text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Number of sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[
\text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
\]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Number of sheep in Seattle} + \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} + \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

polymath-low-en-7,"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into manageable steps and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **Calculate the time to download the first 80 GB:**
   Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute. Therefore, the time to download the first 80 GB is:
   \[
   \text{Time for first 80 GB} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   After the 40% mark, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning due to the 20-minute Windows update. The remaining 60% of the file is 120 GB (since 40% is 80 GB, and 100% - 40% = 60%, and 60% of 200 GB is 120 GB). The time to download the remaining 120 GB is:
   \[
   \text{Time for remaining 120 GB} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}

polymath-low-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **Initial Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time for the fourth segment: \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).
   - Distance covered: \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we sum the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
\[
180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles}
\]

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[
315 \text{ miles} - 180 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles}

polymath-low-en-9,"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings from her regular hours and her overtime hours separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first 40 hours of work. Since her regular rate is $10 per hour, her earnings for these 40 hours are:
\[
40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week, so she worked 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is:
\[
10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 1.2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
\]
Therefore, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[
5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum her earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
\[

   \[
   \text{Downloads in the first month} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% from the number of downloads in the second month. This means the third month's downloads are 70% of the second month's downloads.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts costs $68.
\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = 204
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this net profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90, which is a one-time cost and does not change each year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost of $90 is a one-time expense and does not affect the net profit calculation once the tree starts producing lemons, we need to find out how many years it takes for the net profit to cover the initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost of $90. The net profit per year is $7.5, so we set up the equation:
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is half of \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \), which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry. The jewelry is currently worth $5,000 and the jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%. The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Future value of jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets. The electronic gadgets are currently worth $8,000 and the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%. The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Future value of electronic gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096

polymath-low-en-19,"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we start by calculating the total time she has already spent hiking and the total distance she has covered.

Marissa has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in another 1 hour

So, the total distance covered so far is:
\[4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles}\]

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is:
\[12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles}\]

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail to be 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:
\[\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}\]

Let \( v \) be the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles. The total time for the entire hike will be the sum of the time already spent and the time to walk the remaining distance:
\[1 + 1 + \frac{6}{v} = 2 + \frac{6}{v} \text{ hours}\]

We want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so we set up the equation:
\[4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}}\]

To solve for \( v \), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 2 + \frac{6}{v} \):
\[4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right) = 12\]
\[8 + \frac{24}{v} = 12\]

Next, we isolate the term with \( v \):
\[\frac{24}{v} = 4\]
\[24 = 4v\]
\[v = 6\]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour.",6,6

4. Find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.**

The orange drink is two-thirds water. Therefore, the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water. Therefore, the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the amount of water in the 9 liters of orange drink after spilling one liter.**

Since we spill one liter of the orange drink, the amount of orange drink left is:
\[ 9 \text{ liters} \]
The amount of water in the 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink.**

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:

polymath-low-en-23,"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.
3. Conclude the final answer.

First, let's calculate the total time the candle burns. The burning time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ cm/hour} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.",0,8
polymath-low-en-24,"To determine the original price of the book, we start by understanding that Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount was applied to the original price. This means that $19.50 is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book by \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

Thus, the original price of the book is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
polymath-low-en-25,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she did not order, which includes the chicken meal, the milk packs, and the apples.

1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items Marie did not order:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.5} = 2\]

Thus, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\).",2,2
polymath-low-en-26,"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing separately and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the cost of the shorts:
\[
\text{Cost of shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants:
\[
\text{Cost of pants} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]

Then, we calculate the cost of the shoes:
\[
\text{Cost of shoes} = 3 \times 42 = 126
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243
\]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is \(\boxed{243}\).",243,243
polymath-low-en-27,"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[
\boxed{16}

polymath-low-en-28,"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance traveled between the two stops.

1. Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles.
2. His first stop was after 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, his second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to find out how many miles he traveled between his first stop (at 20 miles) and his second stop (at 45 miles). This can be calculated by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
\[45 - 20 = 25\]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
polymath-low-en-29,"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, the cost of the two pairs of high heels together is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. One pair of high heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. This total cost is five dollars less than the cost of the boots, so we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104
polymath-low-en-30,"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to determine Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-en-31,"To find the average guess for the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the guesses of each friend.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's identify the guesses:
- The first friend says 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \). So, the second friend's guess is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
- The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \). So, the third friend's guess is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
