""Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on the blue ties which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?""

Now, let's answer the question in French and enclose the final number at the end of the response in $\boxed{}$.

Step 1: Determine the number of blue ties Jean bought.
Jean spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each.
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Step 2: Determine the number of red ties Jean bought.
Jean bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of one red tie.
Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Step 5: Calculate the total amount spent on ties.
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-fr-52,"Translation of the question: Uriah's bag becomes too heavy for him. He needs to reduce his weight by 15 pounds. Each of his comic strips weighs 1/4 pound and each of his toys 1/2 pound. If he removes 30 comic strips, how many toys does he need to remove?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the weight reduction from comic strips:**
   - Each comic strip weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
   - Removing 30 comic strips will reduce the weight by:
     \[
     30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining weight reduction needed:**
   - Uriah needs to reduce his total weight by 15 pounds.
   - The weight reduction from comic strips is 7.5 pounds.
   - Therefore, the remaining weight reduction needed from toys is:
     \[
     15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of toys to remove:**
   - Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.
   - To find the number of toys that weigh 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:
     \[
     \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

On Thursday, he repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, he repairs 12 car tires and no truck tires. On which day did the mechanic earn the most money, and how much more did he earn that day compared to the other?

Let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Thursday:**
- Earnings from truck tires: 6 × $60 = $360
- Earnings from car tires: 4 × $40 = $160
- Total earnings on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Earnings from car tires: 12 × $40 = $480
- Earnings from truck tires: 0 × $60 = $0
- Total earnings on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Starting from 20 years of work, she is entitled to an additional 5% of that amount per year. Assuming she quits after 30 years of service, what will her annual pension be?

Answer in French:
Soit $X$ le montant de la pension annuelle après 30 ans de service.

Avant 20 ans de service, Marcy reçoit une pension de $50,000 par an. À partir de 20 ans de service, elle reçoit une augmentation de 5% par an. Donc, après 20 ans de service, sa pension est de $50,000 + 5\% \times 50,000 = 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500$.

Après 30 ans de service, elle reçoit une augmentation supplémentaire de 5% sur le montant de la pension de 20 ans de service. Donc, sa pension sera de $52,500 + 5\% \times 52,500 = 52,500 + 2,625 = 55,125$.

mgsm-fr-74,"Question translated to English: Artie sells flowers at the farmer's market. He sells three types: daisies, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells daisies for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Since he doesn't have change today, Artie decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If he sells 12 pots of daisies, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he make?

To solve the problem, we need to round each price to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total amount of money Artie will make.

1. Rounding the prices:
   - Daisies: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
   - Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
   - Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

2. Calculating the total for each type of flower:
   - Daisies: $3.00 per pot × 12 pots = $36.00
   - Petunias: $2.00 per pot × 9 pots = $18.00
   - Begonias: $2.00 per pot × 17 pots = $34.00

3. Adding the totals:
   $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

Therefore, Artie will make $\boxed{88}$.",88,88

Luc spends time building sandcastles on the beach. He notices that each level of a sandcastle has half the surface area of the level below it. What is the average surface area of a level, knowing that the sandcastle has 4 levels and the top level has a surface area of 16 square feet?

To find the average surface area of a level, we need to determine the surface area of each level and then calculate the average.

1. Let the surface area of the top level be \( S_1 = 16 \) square feet.
2. The surface area of the second level \( S_2 \) is half of \( S_1 \):
   \[
   S_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times S_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ square feet}
   \]
3. The surface area of the third level \( S_3 \) is half of \( S_2 \):
   \[
   S_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times S_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ square feet}
   \]
4. The surface area of the fourth level \( S_4 \) is half of \( S_3 \):
   \[
   S_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times S_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Now, we sum the surface areas of all four levels:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

Finally, we calculate the average surface area of a level:
\[
\text{Average surface area} = \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

mgsm-fr-84,"First, let's translate the question into English:
""A football team played 22 matches. It won _ times more than it lost. How many times did it win?""

Let's denote the number of times the team won as \( W \) and the number of times it lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of matches played is 22, so we have:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that the team won \( x \) times more than it lost, which can be written as:
\[ W = L + x \]

We can substitute \( L + x \) for \( W \) in the first equation:
\[ L + x + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + x = 22 \]

Since \( W = L + x \), we can express \( x \) as:
\[ x = W - L \]

Substituting \( x = W - L \) into the equation \( 2L + x = 22 \):
\[ 2L + (W - L) = 22 \]
\[ 2L + W - L = 22 \]
\[ W + L = 22 \]

This confirms our initial equation. To find \( W \), we need to solve for \( W \) and \( L \). From \( W = L + x \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) and \( x \):
\[ L = W - x \]

Substituting \( L = W - x \) into \( W + L = 22 \):
\[ W + (W - x) = 22 \]
\[ 2W - x = 22 \]

Since \( x = W - L \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( W \) and \( L \):
\[ x = W - (W - x) \]
\[ x = x \]

This confirms that \( x \) is consistent. To find the specific values, we can test integer solutions. Let's assume \( x = 1 \):
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 1 \]
\[ W + (W - 1) = 22 \]
\[ 2W - 1 = 22 \]
\[ 2W = 23 \]
\[ W = 12 \]

Thus, the team won 12 times. Let's verify:
\[ W = 12 \]
\[ L = 12 - 1 = 11 \]
\[ W + L = 12 + 11 = 23 \]

This does not match our initial equation. Let's try \( x = 2 \):
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 2 \]
\[ W + (W - 2) = 22 \]
\[ 2W - 2 = 22 \]
\[ 2W = 24 \]
\[ W = 12 \]

Thus, the team won 12 times. Let's verify:
\[ W = 12 \]
\[ L = 12 - 2 = 10 \]
\[ W + L = 12 + 10 = 22 \]

This matches our initial equation. Therefore, the number of times the team won is:

Question: Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. How many pounds of insects does a flock of ten ducks need per day?

Now, let's solve the question in French:

1. We know that the ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
2. We need to find out how much they need per day.
3. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly amount by 7 to find the daily amount.

Calculation:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

For a flock of ten ducks, the amount of insects needed per day remains the same because the daily requirement is based on the individual need of each duck.

Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees per year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Tom commence avec 50 arbres.
2. Il plante 10 arbres par an, donc en 10 ans, il plantera 10 arbres/an × 10 ans = 100 arbres.
3. Il coupe 2 arbres par an, donc en 10 ans, il coupera 2 arbres/an × 10 ans = 20 arbres.
4. Au total, en 10 ans, il aura planté 100 arbres et coupera 20 arbres, ce qui fait 100 + 20 = 120 arbres.
5. Donc, au bout de 10 ans, il aura 50 arbres + 120 arbres = 170 arbres.
6. 30% des arbres meurent, donc 30% de 170 arbres = 0,30 × 170 = 51 arbres meurent.

Then, on Sunday morning, they added 18 more plastic roses to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more plastic roses than white roses were there in the garden?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of plastic roses on Friday:**
   \[
   \text{Initial roses} = 18
   \]

2. **Number of roses taken on Saturday:**
   \[

Violetta veut acheter des crayons. Elle en a besoin dans 5 couleurs différentes et a prévu de dépenser 20 $ pour cet achat. Sachant que chaque crayon coûte 2 $, combien aura-t-elle de monnaie ?

Pour résoudre le problème, nous devons d'abord calculer le coût total des crayons. Violetta veut acheter 5 crayons, et chaque crayon coûte 2 $.

\[
\text{Coût total des crayons} = 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ $/crayon} = 10 \text{ $}

Now, let's answer the question in French and enclose the final number in $\boxed{}$.

1. First, we need to find the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser together. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

How much money does Marc earn in a week, in cents?

Now, let's answer the question in French:

Soit \( x \) le nombre de phrases que Marc révise chaque semaine pour l'éditeur A. Donc, il révise \( x \) phrases pour l'éditeur B. Marc révise un total de 1 000 phrases par semaine, donc nous avons la relation :

\[ x = 500 \]

Marc révise donc 500 phrases pour l'éditeur A et 500 phrases pour l'éditeur B.

L'éditeur A paie 5 cents par phrase, donc pour 500 phrases, l'éditeur A paie :

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Since both pools lose water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 2 minutes, each pool loses \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) gallons.
4. Therefore, two minutes ago, the smaller pool had \( x - 8 \) gallons, and the larger pool had \( 2x - 8 \) gallons.
5. Now, the smaller pool has \( x - 8 - 4 = x - 12 \) gallons (since it lost 4 gallons in the last minute).
6. Now, the larger pool has \( 2x - 8 - 4 = 2x - 12 \) gallons (since it lost 4 gallons in the last minute).
7. According to the problem, now the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool:
   \[
   2x - 12 = 4(x - 12)
   \]
8. Solving the equation:
   \[
   2x - 12 = 4x - 48
   \]
   \[
   36 = 2x
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]
9. Therefore, the smaller pool now has:
   \[
   x - 12 = 18 - 12 = 6 \text{ gallons}
   \]

The quantity of water in the smaller pool now is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,8

Jean runs 60 miles every week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and runs twice as much on the other two days.

Now, let's solve the problem in French and provide the final answer.

Jean court 60 miles par semaine. Il court 3 jours par semaine. Le premier jour, il court pendant 3 heures et court deux fois moins les deux autres jours.

Pour calculer la vitesse de course, nous devons d'abord déterminer combien il court chaque jour.

1. Le premier jour, il court pendant 3 heures.
2. Les deux autres jours, il court deux fois moins que le premier jour, donc 3 heures / 2 = 1,5 heures par jour.

Total de temps couru par semaine = 3 heures (premier jour) + 1,5 heures (deuxième jour) + 1,5 heures (troisième jour) = 6 heures.

Vitesse de course = Distance / Temps = 60 miles / 6 heures = 10 miles par heure.

La vitesse de course de Jean est de $\boxed{10}$ miles par heure.",10,10

Dana runs four times faster than she walks, but jumps twice as fast as she runs. If she jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she walk in six hours, given that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana jumps at 3 miles per hour.
   - She jumps twice as fast as she runs, so her running speed is:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = \frac{\text{Jumping speed}}{2} = \frac{3 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance walked:**
   - Walking speed: 1.5 miles per hour.
   - Distance walked in 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance walked} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}

polymath-low-fr-41,"Question translated to English: Perg, the great dragon, was sitting at the top of the Farbo mountain and spitting fire over a distance of 1000 feet. Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but with a range of 400 feet, which was well within the dragon's reach. However, when Polly held the sapphire stone, she could throw it three times farther. With the precious stone in hand, at what distance could Polly stay out of the dragon's reach while still being able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The dragon's range with the golden javelin is 400 feet.
2. With the sapphire stone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther, so the new range is \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) feet.
3. The dragon can spit fire over a distance of 1000 feet.

To stay out of the dragon's reach, Polly needs to throw the javelin at a distance greater than 1000 feet. With the sapphire stone, Polly can throw the javelin up to 1200 feet. Therefore, she can stay 1001 feet away from the dragon (since 1200 feet is more than 1000 feet).

The final answer is 1001 feet, which we enclose in $\boxed{1001}$.",1001,200

If a 300 g bag contains 5 portions, how many grams of chips will you eat, knowing that your daily calorie goal is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?

Let's solve the problem step by step:
1. Calculate the total calories in a 300 g bag of chips:
   \[
   5 \text{ portions} \times 250 \text{ calories/portion} = 1250 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. Determine how many grams of chips correspond to 1250 calories:

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Calculer le coût total pour produire 20 bougies :
   - Chaque bougie nécessite 1/10 de livre de cire d'abeille.
   - Donc, pour 20 bougies, il faut 20 * 1/10 = 2 livres de cire d'abeille.
   - Le coût total de la cire est donc 2 livres * $10.00/livre = $20.00.

2. Calculer le coût total pour produire 20 bougies et les mèches :
   - Le coût total pour les mèches est également $20.00.

3. Calculer le coût total pour produire et vendre 20 bougies :
   - Coût total = coût de la cire + coût des mèches = $20.00 + $20.00 = $40.00.

4. Calculer le revenu total de la vente de 20 bougies :
   - Chaque bougie est vendue à $2.00.
   - Donc, le revenu total est 20 bougies * $2.00/bougie = $40.00.

1. **First half of the year**: 
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly cost is $140.
   - Total cost for the first half of the year:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ $}
     \]

2. **Second half of the year**: 
   - The cost is 10% less than the original $140.
   - Calculate the reduced cost:
     \[
     140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ $}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ $}
     \]

3. **Total cost for the year**:
   - Add the costs of the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ $}
     \]

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service at the end of the year is $\boxed{1596}$.",1596,1596

She has driven 100 miles since her last full tank and had to add 4 gallons of gas to refill the tank. The user manual states that her tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophie drive with a single full tank of gas?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Sophie's tank capacity is 12 gallons.
2. She used 4 gallons to refill the tank, meaning she has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left after her 100-mile trip.
3. To find out how many miles she can drive with a full tank, we calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) she gets with the remaining 8 gallons.
4. Since she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, her car gets 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon (mpg).
5. With a full 12 gallons, she can drive 12 gallons * 25 mpg = 300 miles.

The answer in French is: Sophie peut parcourir $\boxed{300}$ miles avec un seul plein d'essence.",300,300

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Let's denote the number of diamonds as \( D \).
2. According to the problem, \( D = 175 \).
3. The number of rubies \( R \) is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds:
   \[
   R = D - 35
   \]
4. Substituting \( D = 175 \):
   \[
   R = 175 - 35 = 140

""During the week, Judy gives 5 dance classes every day and 8 classes on Saturday. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in a week?""

Now, let's answer the question in French and provide the final number enclosed in $\boxed{}$.

**Réponse en français:**

D'abord, calculons le nombre total de classes que Judy donne pendant la semaine. Elle donne 5 classes par jour pendant 7 jours, donc elle donne 5 × 7 = 35 classes pendant la semaine. De plus, elle donne 8 classes le samedi. Donc, le total de classes pendant la semaine est 35 + 8 = 43 classes.

Ensuite, nous devons calculer le nombre total d'élèves. Si chaque classe compte 15 élèves, alors 43 classes représentent 43 × 15 = 645 élèves.

Enfin, pour trouver le total de l'argent qu'elle gagne, nous multiplions le nombre d'élèves par le coût par élève. Donc, 645 élèves × 15,00 $ par élève = 9675 $.

La réponse en français est donc: Judy gagne 9675 $ en une semaine.

Artie sells flowers at the farmer's market. He sells three types: daisies, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells daisies for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Since he doesn't have change today, Artie decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If he sells 12 pots of daisies, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he make?

Now, let's answer the question in French:
Le prix des daisies est arrondi à $3, car $2.74 est plus près de $3 que de $2.
Le prix des pétunias est arrondi à $2, car $1.87 est plus près de $2 que de $1.
Le prix des bégonias est arrondi à $2, car $2.12 est plus près de $2 que de $3.
Donc, Artie vendra les daisies pour $3 par pot, les pétunias pour $2 par pot, et les bégonias pour $2 par pot.

Calculons le montant total :
12 pots de daisies : $3 x 12 = $36
9 pots de pétunias : $2 x 9 = $18

What is the average surface area of a level, knowing that the sandcastle has 4 levels and the top level has an area of 16 square feet?

To answer this question in French, we need to find the average surface area of a level in a sandcastle with 4 levels, given that the top level has an area of 16 square feet and each subsequent level has half the area of the level above it.

1. Let's denote the surface area of the top level as \( A_1 = 16 \) square feet.
2. The second level, \( A_2 \), has half the area of the top level: \( A_2 = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
3. The third level, \( A_3 \), has half the area of the second level: \( A_3 = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
4. The fourth level, \( A_4 \), has half the area of the third level: \( A_4 = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

The average surface area \( \bar{A} \) of the levels is calculated by summing the areas of all levels and dividing by the number of levels:

\[
\bar{A} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}

Then, she will need to give 2 bowls every day until the puppy's end of life. If one bag of dog food represents 110 bowls, how many bags of dog food for dogs will Cécilia use during the first year?

Let's calculate the number of bags of dog food Cécilia will use during the first year.

1. For the first 180 days, Cécilia will need 1 bowl of dog food per day:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ bowl/day} = 180 \text{ bowls} \]

2. Convert the bowls to bags of dog food:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ bowls}}{110 \text{ bowls/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} \approx 1.636 \text{ bags} \]

3. For the remaining days of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), Cécilia will need 2 bowls of dog food per day:

Let's denote the number of times the team won as \( W \) and the number of times it lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of matches played is 22, so we have:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won \( x \) times more than it lost, which translates to:
\[ W = L + x \]

We can substitute \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + x) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + x = 22 \]

Since \( W = L + x \), we can solve for \( L \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 2L + x = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - x \]
\[ L = \frac{22 - x}{2} \]

Now, substituting \( L \) back into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = L + x \]
\[ W = \frac{22 - x}{2} + x \]
\[ W = \frac{22 - x + 2x}{2} \]
\[ W = \frac{22 + x}{2} \]

To find the number of times the team won, we need to determine the value of \( x \). Since \( W \) and \( L \) must be integers, \( 22 - x \) must be even, implying \( x \) must be even. Let's test possible values for \( x \):

If \( x = 2 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 2}{2} = 10 \]
\[ W = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

If \( x = 4 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 4}{2} = 8 \]
\[ W = 8 + 4 = 12 \]

If \( x = 6 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 6}{2} = 8 \]
\[ W = 8 + 6 = 14 \]

If \( x = 8 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 8}{2} = 7 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

If \( x = 10 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 10}{2} = 6 \]
\[ W = 6 + 10 = 16 \]

If \( x = 12 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 12}{2} = 5 \]
\[ W = 5 + 12 = 17 \]

If \( x = 14 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 14}{2} = 4 \]
\[ W = 4 + 14 = 18 \]

If \( x = 16 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 16}{2} = 3 \]
\[ W = 3 + 16 = 19 \]

If \( x = 18 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 18}{2} = 2 \]
\[ W = 2 + 18 = 20 \]

If \( x = 20 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 20}{2} = 1 \]
\[ W = 1 + 20 = 21 \]

If \( x = 22 \):
\[ L = \frac{22 - 22}{2} = 0 \]
\[ W = 0 + 22 = 22 \]

Among these, the only feasible solution where both \( W \) and \( L \) are integers is when \( x = 2 \) and \( W = 12 \).

   - From age 23 to age 34, he has been going for \(34 - 23 = 11\) years.

2. Each year of vacation corresponds to one row of squares in the quilt. Therefore, there are 11 rows.

3. Each row consists of one t-shirt, and since each t-shirt is one square, there are 11 squares in each row.

4. The total number of squares in the quilt is the number of rows multiplied by the number of squares per row:
   \[
   11 \text{ rows} \times 11 \text{ squares per row} = 121 \text{ squares}
   \]

The total number of squares in Gene's quilt is \(\boxed{121}\).",121,44
polymath-low-fr-86,"Question translated to English: Greg has an alarm that rings three times a day. When the alarm goes off, it rings until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time, it rang three times longer than the first time. The third time, it rang twice as long as the second time. How many times in total has the alarm rung?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of times the alarm rang during the first time it went off.
2. According to the problem, \( x = 4 \).
3. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for \( 3x \) times.
4. Substituting \( x = 4 \), the second time it rang for \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) times.
5. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for \( \frac{3x}{2} \) times.
6. Substituting \( x = 4 \), the third time it rang for \( \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 6 \) times.

Now, we sum up the total number of times the alarm rang:

\[
x + 3x + \frac{3x}{2} = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22
\]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\).",22,22

He knows that 10 pounds are needed for an adult dinosaur and half of that amount for a child dinosaur. If 20 adults and 5 children are at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to make sure everyone has enough?

To answer this question, we will calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children separately, then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the potato salad needed for the adults:
   - Each adult needs 10 pounds.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults = 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

2. Calculate the potato salad needed for the children:
   - Each child needs half of 10 pounds, which is 5 pounds.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children = 5 pounds/child * 5 children = 25 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed:
   - Total potato salad = 200 pounds (for adults) + 25 pounds (for children) = 225 pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring $\boxed{225}$ pounds of potato salad.",225,225

1. Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
   - Amy: \( A \)
   - Jackson: \( J \)
   - Corey: \( C \)
   - Jacques: \( Q \)

2. We are given the following information:
   - \( A = J + 5 \)
   - \( A = C - 2 \)
   - \( Q = C - 1 \)
   - \( Q = 10 \)

3. Using the information that \( Q = 10 \):
   \[
   10 = C - 1 \implies C = 11

If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, what is, in seconds, the time Gerald takes to run the same distance after his new diet?""

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate the improvement in Gerald's speed:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - To find the new time, we need to determine what 10% of his original time is.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is \( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) seconds.

3. **Calculate Gerald's new time:**
   - Subtract the improvement from his original time.
   - Gerald's new time is \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) seconds.

If each of them has eaten all their rolls, on average, how many rolls have they eaten in total?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of rolls eaten by Béatrice:**
   - Béatrice has 2 wide rolls and 24 long rolls.
   - Total rolls eaten by Béatrice = 2 + 24 = 26 rolls.

Now, let's answer the question in French and enclose the final number in $\boxed{}$.

**Réponse en français :**

La vitesse de Julia est de $20 \text{ pieds} / 16 \text{ secondes} = 1,25 \text{ pieds/secondes}$. 

La distance à parcourir est de 64 secondes, donc la distance totale est de $1,25 \times 64 = 80 \text{ pieds}$.

Le bateau prend deux litres d'eau pour chaque dix pieds. Donc, pour 80 pieds, le bateau prend en eau $8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ litres}$.

La réponse en français est donc $\boxed{16}$.",16,16

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Each teacher gives 2 classes a day.
2. There are 4 teachers, so the total number of classes given in a day is:
   \[
   4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ classes/teacher} = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]
3. Each class uses the whiteboard once, so the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is 8.
4. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.
5. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:
   \[

Now, let's answer the question in French:
""Chaque jour, Ryan plantait 2 fleurs dans son jardin. Savoir que 5 fleurs n'ont pas poussé, combien de fleurs aura-t-il au bout de 15 jours ?""

Pour résoudre ce problème, nous devons d'abord déterminer combien de fleurs Ryan a plantées au total en 15 jours. Ryan plantait 2 fleurs par jour, donc en 15 jours, il a planté :
\[ 2 \text{ fleurs/jour} \times 15 \text{ jours} = 30 \text{ fleurs} \]

Ensuite, nous devons soustraire le nombre de fleurs qui n'ont pas poussé de ce total :
\[ 30 \text{ fleurs} - 5 \text{ fleurs} = 25 \text{ fleurs} \]

Donc, au bout de 15 jours, Ryan aura $\boxed{25}$ fleurs.",25,25

Question: Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's. Brittany's phone can store up to 50 times more photos than the number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal, where the photo shows ducks at the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo Jamal took?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of birds (ducks) in the photo taken by Jamal.
2. According to the problem, Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos.
3. Brittany's phone can store 6 times more photos than Jamal's, so Brittany's phone can store \( 6 \times 1800 = 10800 \) photos.
4. The number of photos Brittany's phone can store is also 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo, so we have the equation:
   \[
   10800 = 50x
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{10800}{50} = 216

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of coffee spoonfuls of sugar.
2. Let \( y \) be the number of teacups of water.
3. According to the ratio 7 : 13, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{y} = \frac{7}{13}
   \]
4. We also know that the total number of spoonfuls used is 120:
   \[
   x + y = 120
   \]

5. From the ratio, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = \frac{13}{7}x
   \]

6. Substitute \( y \) in the total spoonfuls equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{13}{7}x = 120
   \]

7. Combine the terms:
   \[
   \frac{7x + 13x}{7} = 120

The next day, new containers arrived, increasing the total number of vehicles in the port to 30. Calculate the number of imported containers on the second day, assuming each container holds 5 vehicles.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Count:**
   - The agent counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles each.
   - Total vehicles initially: \( 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \).

2. **Total Vehicles After New Containers Arrived:**

If Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their salaries four years later.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step in French:

1. **Déterminer le salaire initial d'Adrien**:
   Adrien gagnait 40 000 $ il y a quatre ans. Donc, son salaire initial était de 40 000 $.

2. **Calculer le salaire de Lylah**:
   Soit \( S_L \) le salaire de Lylah. Adrien avait 30% plus que Lylah, donc :
   \[
   40 000 = S_L + 0,30 \times S_L = 1,30 \times S_L
   \]
   En résolvant pour \( S_L \):
   \[
   S_L = \frac{40 000}{1,30} = \frac{40 000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400 000}{13} \approx 30 769,23 \text{ $}

Il a été demandé à Morisette et Kael d'apporter des fruits. Morisette a apporté 5 pommes et 8 oranges, tandis que Kael a apporté deux fois plus de pommes et la moitié moins d'oranges que Morisette. Combien de fruits ont-ils apporté en tout ?

Let's solve the problem step by step in French:

1. **Nombre de pommes apportées par Morisette et Kael:**
   - Morisette a apporté 5 pommes.
   - Kael a apporté deux fois plus de pommes que Morisette, donc Kael a apporté \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pommes.

2. **Nombre d'oranges apportées par Morisette et Kael:**
   - Morisette a apporté 8 oranges.
   - Kael a apporté la moitié moins d'oranges que Morisette, donc Kael a apporté \(8 - \frac{8}{2} = 8 - 4 = 4\) oranges.

3. **Total de fruits apportés par Morisette:**
   - Morisette a apporté \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits.

4. **Total de fruits apportés par Kael:**
   - Kael a apporté \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits.

Given that there were initially 30 cars on the highway, how many cars have passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the highway.
2. 5 cars leave the line, so the number of cars remaining is:

If the city extends over 42 miles from the ocean's edge to the interior's edge, how many minutes will it take the fog bank to cover the entire city?

Pour résoudre ce problème, nous commençons en notant que le banc de brouillard couvre 3 miles en 10 minutes. Nous devons donc déterminer combien de temps il faut pour couvrir 42 miles.

Premièrement, nous pouvons calculer le taux de couverture du banc de brouillard. Il couvre 3 miles en 10 minutes, donc le taux de couverture est de 3 miles par 10 minutes, ce qui est équivalent à 0,3 miles par minute.

Ensuite, pour couvrir 42 miles à ce taux, nous divisons le nombre total de miles par le taux de couverture :
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0,3 \text{ miles/minute}} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

La réponse en français est donc 140 minutes. Encapsulons la réponse finale :

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Total number of puzzle pieces: 1000
2. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. Remaining pieces after Poppy places her pieces:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. Poppy's mother places a third of the remaining pieces:
   \[

mgsm-fr-107,"Question translated to English: Every evening, Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework. Last Monday and Tuesday, he watched each night one episode of his favorite show for 1 hour. On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished his homework earlier and watched one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute episode. On Friday, he could stay up late because it was the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes each. If he watched a total of 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Let's calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 days * 1 hour/night = 2 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours
Total time from Monday to Friday: 2 + 1.5 + 4 = 7.5 hours

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday must be:
7.5 hours - 7 hours = 0.5 hour

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hour long, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
0.5 hour / 0.5 hour/episode = 1 episode

The answer is $\boxed{1}$.",1,3

Question: Henri is preparing cookies for a local pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many as last year. At the end of the baking, he realizes he made 15 more than planned. While cooling, he drops 5 of his cookies and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri prepare last year?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

Soit \( x \) le nombre de cookies préparés l'année dernière. Henri veut faire deux fois plus que l'année dernière, donc il prévoit de faire \( 2x \) cookies. Il a fait 15 cookies de plus que prévu, donc il a fait \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. Il a aussi perdu 5 cookies en les laissant tomber, donc il a finalement 110 cookies. On peut écrire l'équation suivante :

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve the problem in French and provide the final answer:

1. Prix d'achat sans remboursement : 
   Prix unitaire par gallon = $3.00
   Quantité achetée = 10 gallons
   Total d'achat sans remboursement = 3.00 × 10 = $30.00

2. Total des remboursements :
   Remboursement par gallon = $0.20
   Quantité achetée = 10 gallons
   Total des remboursements = 0.20 × 10 = $2.00

3. Prix d'achat après remboursements :

Unfortunately, due to an error, Béatrice ends up with 2 wide rolls and 24 long rolls, while Marcell gets 3 wide rolls and 14 long rolls. If each of them has eaten all of their rolls, on average, how many rolls have they eaten in total?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of rolls each person has eaten:**
   - Béatrice: \(2\) wide rolls + \(24\) long rolls = \(26\) rolls
   - Marcell: \(3\) wide rolls + \(14\) long rolls = \(17\) rolls

2. **Calculate the total number of rolls eaten by both:**

""A leak occurred in Julia's boat while she was on the lake. The boat began to take in two liters of water for every ten feet rowed towards the shore. It took Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. How much water had the boat taken in when Julia reached the shore, if the shore was 64 seconds away?""

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. **Determine the speed of rowing:**
   Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time to reach the shore:**
   The distance to the shore is 64 seconds. Since her speed is \(\frac{5}{4}\) feet/second, the time to reach the shore is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet/second}} = 64 \times \frac{4}{5} \text{ seconds} = \frac{256}{5} \text{ seconds} = 51.2 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance rowed in 51.2 seconds:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet/second} \times 51.2 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 12.8 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of water taken in:**
   The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 64 feet, the amount of water taken in is:
   \[
   \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 64 \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{10} \times 64 \text{ liters} = 0.2 \times 64 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters}

If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo Jamal took?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   - Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos.
   - Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone.
   \[
   \text{Capacity of Brittany's phone} = \frac{\text{Capacity of Jamal's phone}}{6} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \text{ photos}

2. **Relate the number of photos to the number of birds:**
   - Brittany's phone can store 300 photos.
   - Brittany's phone can store up to 50 times more photos than the number of birds seen in Jamal's photo.
   \[
   \text{Number of birds seen in Jamal's photo} = \frac{\text{Capacity of Brittany's phone}}{50} = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \text{ birds}

The next day, new containers arrived, increasing the total number of vehicles in the port to 30. Calculate the number of imported containers the second day, assuming each container holds 5 vehicles.

Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Determine the initial number of vehicles:
   - The agent counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the initial number of vehicles is:
     \[
     2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. Determine the number of vehicles added the second day:
   - The total number of vehicles after the new containers arrived is 30.
   - Therefore, the number of vehicles added is:

If Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned 40,000$ four years ago, calculate the total amount of their salaries four years later.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   - Adrien's initial salary: $40,000
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \).

   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \text{ (approximately)}

Question: Well's mother sells melons, peppers, and oranges at the neighborhood store. A melon costs three times as much as a pepper, and an orange costs half as much as a melon. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 melons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much money will he spend if each pepper costs $15?

Now, let's answer the question in French and enclose the final number at the end of the response in $\boxed{}$.

Réponse: 
Chaque melon coûte $3 \times 15 = 45$ $. 
Une orange coûte $45 / 2 = 22.50$ $.

Donc, le coût total pour Dillon est de $4 \times 45 + 20 \times 15 + 10 \times 22.50 = 180 + 300 + 225 = 705$ $.

La somme totale que Dillon dépensera est donc $\boxed{705}$.",705,880

""A hospital admits 500 people per day. On average, each patient is examined for 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital and the hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these consultations?""

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. **Calculer le nombre d'heures d'examen par jour**:
   - Chaque patient est examiné en moyenne pendant 24 minutes.
   - Il y a 500 patients par jour.
   - Il y a 60 minutes dans une heure.
   - Le nombre d'heures d'examen par jour est donc : 
     \[
     \frac{500 \text{ patients}}{5 \text{ patients par heure}} = 100 \text{ heures}
     \]

2. **Calculer le coût total des consultations**:
   - Les médecins facturent 150 $ par heure à l'hôpital.
   - Le coût total des consultations est :
     \[
     100 \text{ heures} \times 150 \text{ $/heure} = 15000 \text{ $}
     \]

3. **Calculer le revenu total des consultations**:
   - Les patients payent 200 $ par heure.
   - Le revenu total des consultations est :
     \[
     100 \text{ heures} \times 200 \text{ $/heure} = 20000 \text{ $}
     \]

4. **Calculer le bénéfice**:
   - Le bénéfice est le revenu total moins le coût total :
     \[
     20000 \text{ $} - 15000 \text{ $} = 5000 \text{ $}

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5 before the comparison:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]
   So, Brian has 15 video games.

2. Bobby has 5 video games less than 3 times the number of video games Brian has:
   \[
   3 \times 15 - 5

2. A third of these unicorns are in the Highlands, in Scotland. Therefore, the number of Scottish unicorns is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]

3. Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are women. Therefore, the number of Scottish unicorns that are women is:

To solve this, let's calculate the total cost of the items first:

- Cost of submarines: 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
- Cost of fries: 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
- Cost of biscuits: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we calculate the delivery charges:

- Delivery charges: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we add the tip:

- Total cost with tip: $20.00 + $5.00 = $25.00

Finally, we add the delivery charges:

- Total cost including delivery: $25.00 + $4.00 = $29.00

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Test:**
   - Total questions: 75
   - Rate: 5 questions per hour
   - Time taken: 8 hours

   To verify the time taken:
   \[
   \text{Time taken} = \frac{\text{Total questions}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]
   However, the problem states Marc took 8 hours, which seems inconsistent with the rate. Given the problem's conditions, we'll use the provided 8 hours.

2. **Second Test:**
   - Total questions: 100
   - Rate: 5 questions per hour
   - Time taken: 6 hours

   To verify the time taken:

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of cars**: 20
2. **Number of automatic cars**: 12
3. **Number of manual cars**: 4

First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We can do this by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars}
\]

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many eggs remain after Janet's daily consumption and use:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs laid per day} = 16

Josh starts renovating a house. He buys it for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in its restoration. The value of the house then increases by 150%. What profit has he made?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. D'abord, calculons la valeur finale de la maison après l'augmentation de 150%.
   - La valeur initiale de la maison est de $80,000.
   - L'augmentation de 150% signifie que la valeur finale sera de $80,000 + 150% de $80,000.
   - Calculons 150% de $80,000 : 150/100 * $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.
   - Ajoutons cette valeur à la valeur initiale : $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

2. Ensuite, calculons le bénéfice en soustrayant le coût total de la maison et de la restauration de sa valeur finale.
   - Le coût total est $80,000 (achat) + $50,000 (restauration) = $130,000.

   - Total for 20 chickens: \( 40 \times 20 = 800 \) bowls

3. **Total bowls of food needed for all chickens for the day:**
   - Since each chicken needs 3 bowls of food per day:
   - Total for 20 chickens: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) bowls

4. **Bowls of food needed for the last meal:**
   - Bowls given in the morning and afternoon: 800 bowls
   - Bowls needed for the last meal: \( 800 - 60 = 740 \) bowls

How far is he from his home at the end of 4 hours?

Let's calculate the distance step by step.

1. **First 3 hours at 60 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}

   Jean drives 15 miles back towards home.

4. **Remaining time to return:**
   \[
   \text{Total time remaining} = 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   Jean has 1.5 hours left to drive back home.

5. **Driving at 80 mph for the remaining 1.5 hours:**

mgsm-fr-10,"Question translated to English: A new program was downloaded 60 times during the first month. The number of downloads during the second month was three times the number from the first month. It then decreased by 30% during the third month. How many times in total was the program downloaded over these three months?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   \[
   \text{First month downloads} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times \text{First month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads decreased by 30% during the third month. To find the decrease, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Therefore, the third month's downloads are:
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   We sum the downloads from each month:
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = \text{First month downloads} + \text{Second month downloads} + \text{Third month downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

""Toula bought several different pastries from the bakery. She bought 3 dozen waffles for $68 a dozen, 2 dozen small cakes for $80 a dozen, and 6 dozen cheese cakes for $55 a dozen. What is the total cost?""

Now, let's answer the question in French:
La question est la suivante : Toula a acheté plusieurs pâtisseries différentes à la boulangerie. Elle a acheté 3 douzaines de beignets à 68 $ la douzaine, 2 douzaines de petits gâteaux à 80 $ la douzaine et 6 douzaines de petits gâteaux au fromage à 55 $ la douzaine. À combien s'élève le coût total ?

Pour calculer le coût total, nous devons additionner les coûts de chaque type de pâtisserie :

1. Beignets : 3 douzaines à 68 $ la douzaine
   \[
   3 \times 68 = 204 \text{ $}
   \]

2. Petits gâteaux : 2 douzaines à 80 $ la douzaine

3. Petits gâteaux au fromage : 6 douzaines à 55 $ la douzaine
   \[
   6 \times 55 = 330 \text{ $}

Question: Melanie does home sales. At the Green House, she sold one third of her vacuum cleaners, then 2 more at the Red House, and finally half of what was left at the Orange House. If there are 5 vacuum cleaners left for Melanie, how many did she have to start with?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step in French:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially.
2. At the Green House, she sold \(\frac{1}{3}x\). The remaining vacuum cleaners are \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \).
3. At the Red House, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners. The remaining vacuum cleaners are \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \).
4. At the Orange House, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. The remaining vacuum cleaners are \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \).
5. According to the problem, the remaining vacuum cleaners are 5. So we have the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5

His financial advisor speculates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% and the electronic gadgets market will increase by 1.2% over the same month. If the merchant chooses the plan that maximizes his profit at the end of the month, what would be the amount of this profit?

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the increase in value for each item:**
   - For jewelry: 
     \[
     \text{Increase in value} = 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125
     \]
   - For electronic gadgets:
     \[
     \text{Increase in value} = 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96
     \]

2. **Determine the total value at the end of the month for each choice:**
   - If the merchant buys jewelry:
     \[
     \text{Total value} = 5000 + 125 = 5125
     \]
   - If the merchant buys electronic gadgets:
     \[
     \text{Total value} = 8000 + 96 = 8096
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit for each choice:**
   - If the merchant buys jewelry:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 5125 - 5000 = 125
     \]
   - If the merchant buys electronic gadgets:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 8096 - 8000 = 96

   - Salaire par heure : $20
   - Salaire par semaine : 35 heures × $20 = $700
   - Heures travaillées par an : 50 semaines × 35 heures = 1750 heures
   - Salaire annuel pour l'enseignement : 1750 heures × $20 = $35000

2. **Calculer le salaire annuel pour l'entraineuse de majorettes :**
   - Heures travaillées par semaine : 15
   - Salaire par heure : $30

mgsm-fr-19,"Question translated to English: Marissa goes on a hike on a trail that is 12 miles long. She took 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles, and another hour to cover the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) must she maintain to cover the remaining distance?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Total distance of the trail**: 12 miles
2. **Distance covered in the first 6 miles**: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
3. **Remaining distance**: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles
4. **Time taken for the first 6 miles**: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
5. **Time remaining to cover the remaining distance**: Let's denote this time as \( t \) hours.
6. **Average speed requirement**: 4 miles per hour

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for average speed:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

Given that the average speed should be 4 miles per hour, we set up the equation:

\[
4 = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours} + t \text{ hours}}
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
4 = \frac{12}{2 + t}
\]

\[
4(2 + t) = 12
\]

\[
8 + 4t = 12
\]

\[
4t = 4
\]

\[
t = 1
\]

So, Marissa has 1 hour left to cover the remaining 6 miles.

Now, we calculate the required speed for the remaining 6 miles:

\[
\text{Required speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Orange juice: 10 liters, composed of two-thirds water.
     - Water in orange juice: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters.
     - Juice in orange juice: \( 10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \) liters.
   - Pineapple juice: 15 liters, composed of three-quarters water.
     - Water in pineapple juice: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25 \) liters.
     - Juice in pineapple juice: \( 15 - 11.25 = 3.75 \) liters.

2. **After Spilling One Liter of Orange Juice:**
   - Orange juice left: \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters.
   - Water in orange juice left: \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{19}{3} \approx 6.33 \) liters.
   - Juice in orange juice left: \( \frac{10}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) liters.
   - Water in pineapple juice remains: 11.25 liters.
   - Juice in pineapple juice remains: 3.75 liters.

3. **Total Remaining Liquids:**
   - Total water in the remaining 24 liters: \( \frac{19}{3} + 11.25 = \frac{19}{3} + \frac{45}{4} = \frac{76}{12} + \frac{135}{12} = \frac{211}{12} \approx 17.58 \) liters.
   - Total juice in the remaining 24 liters: \( 3 + 3.75 = 6.75 \) liters.

   - Total volume: 24 liters.
   - Total water: \( \frac{211}{12} \) liters.
   - Water percentage: \( \frac{\frac{211}{12}}{24} \times 100 \approx \frac{211}{288} \times 100 \approx 73.61\% \).

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Marie a commandé un plat de poulet qui coûte $12,50$, 5 cartons de lait de $3$ chacun, 4 pommes de $1,50$ chacune, et quelques boîtes de pizza.
2. Marie a payé en tout $50$.

La somme totale payée est la somme de la commande de poulet, de lait, de pommes et de pizza. Nous devons d'abord calculer la somme des autres éléments de la commande.

- Le coût du poulet est $12,50$.
- Le coût du lait est $5 \times 3 = 15$.
- Le coût des pommes est $4 \times 1,50 = 6$.

La somme de ces éléments est $12,50 + 15 + 6 = 33,50$.

Mishka bought 3 shorts, 3 pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. A short costs $16.50, a pair of pants costs $22.50, and a pair of shoes costs $42. How much money did Mishka spend in total for this clothing purchase?

Now, let's calculate the total amount Mishka spent:

1. Calculate the cost of the shorts:
\[ 3 \text{ shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per short} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

2. Calculate the cost of the pants:
\[ 3 \text{ pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pant} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

3. Calculate the cost of the shoes:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

4. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:

mgsm-fr-27,"Question translated to English: ""Cynthia eats a portion of ice cream every night. She buys boxes containing 15 portions each, at a price of $4.00 per box. After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?""

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of portions Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 portion per night.
   - There are 60 days.
   - Therefore, she eats \( 60 \) portions in 60 days.

2. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Each box contains 15 portions.
   - To find the number of boxes needed for 60 portions, we divide the total portions by the portions per box:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ portions}}{15 \text{ portions per box}} = 4 \text{ boxes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each box costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 boxes is:
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times 4 \text{ dollars per box} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream.",16,16

To find the number of miles Henri covered between the two breaks, we need to calculate the distance from the first break to the second break.

First break: 20 miles
Second break: 15 miles before the end of the ride, which is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Distance between the two breaks: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

While Gloria is buying shoes, she comes across a pair of boots that fits her budget. However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost $5 less than the boots. If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, what is, in dollars, the price of the boots?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the price of the boots be \( x \) dollars.
2. The price of the two pairs of high heels together is \( x + 5 \) dollars.
3. We know one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the other pair costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
4. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
5. According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the price of the boots:
   \[
   x + 5 = 99

The price of the boots is \( \boxed{94} \).",94,104
mgsm-fr-30,"Question translated to English: The ages of Darell and Allen are in the ratio of 7 : 11. If the sum of their current ages is 162, calculate how old Allen will be in 10 years.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let \( D \) be Darell's current age and \( A \) be Allen's current age.
2. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write:
   \[
   \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
3. We also know that the sum of their ages is 162:
   \[
   D + A = 162
   \]
4. From the ratio \(\frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}\), we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11}A
   \]
5. Substitute \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162
   \]
6. Combine the terms on the left-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162
   \]
   \[
   \frac{18A}{11} = 162
   \]
7. Solve for \( A \):
   \[
   18A = 162 \times 11
   \]
   \[
   18A = 1782
   \]
   \[
   A = \frac{1782}{18}

Another says 20 more than half of the first one's estimate. A third one mentions 25% more than the first one's. What is the average of their estimates?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **First estimate**: 80
2. **Second estimate**: 20 more than half of the first estimate.
   - Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
   - 20 more than 40 is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)
3. **Third estimate**: 25% more than the first estimate.
   - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \)
   - 25% more than 80 is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \)

Now, we have the three estimates: 80, 60, and 100.

4. **Calculate the average of the estimates**:
   - Sum of the estimates: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \)

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Calculer le montant total que Jean a gagné en vendant ses Lego:
   Jean a 13 Lego sets et les a vendus à $15 chacun.
   Montant total = 13 sets × $15/set = $195

2. Calculer le montant total dépensé pour les jeux vidéo:
   Il a acheté 8 jeux vidéo à $20 chacun.
   Montant total = 8 jeux × $20/jeu = $160

3. Calculer le montant total dépensé et gagné:
   Montant dépensé = $160
   Montant gagné = $195
   Montant total dépensé et gagné = $160 + $5 = $165

4. Calculer combien il lui reste de Lego sets:
   Montant total dépensé et gagné = $165
   Montant total dépensé = $160
   Montant restant pour les Lego = $195 - $160 = $35

5. Calculer combien de Lego sets il a vendus:
   Montant total dépensé = $160
   Prix par Lego set = $15
   Nombre de Lego sets vendus = $160 ÷ $15 = 10,666... (approximativement 10 Lego sets)

Jean runs 60 miles each week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and runs twice as much on the other two days.

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Jean court 60 miles par semaine sur 3 jours.
2. Sur le premier jour, il court pendant 3 heures.
3. Sur les deux autres jours, il court à la moitié du temps du premier jour, soit 1,5 heure par jour.

Calculons la distance courue sur les deux autres jours :
- Distance sur le deuxième jour : \( 1,5 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} \)
- Distance sur le troisième jour : \( 1,5 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} \)

Total distance sur les deux jours restants : 
\[ 1,5 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} + 1,5 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} = 3 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} \]

Total distance courue par semaine :
\[ 3 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} + 3 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} = 6 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} \]

Total distance courue par semaine est 60 miles, donc :
\[ 6 \text{ heures} \times \text{vitesse} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Vitesse de course en miles par heure :

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana jumps at 3 miles per hour.
   - She jumps twice as fast as she runs, so her running speed is:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = \frac{3 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the time running and \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time walking over a 6-hour period.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}

   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}

However, when Polly held the sapphire stone, she could throw the dart three times farther. How far could Polly throw the dart so that she could stay out of the dragon's reach while still hitting it with the golden dart?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Distance with the golden dart**: 400 feet.
2. **Distance with the sapphire stone**: 3 times the distance with the golden dart.
   \[
   \text{Distance with the sapphire stone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}

3. **Distance from which Polly can stay out of the dragon's reach**: 1000 feet (the distance of the dragon's flames).

To find the distance Polly can throw the dart while staying out of the dragon's reach, we need to determine the maximum distance she can throw the dart without being within 1000 feet of the dragon. 

4. **Maximum distance without being within 1000 feet**: 
   \[
   \text{Maximum distance} = 1000 \text{ feet} - 400 \text{ feet} = 600 \text{ feet}

Answer: 
1. D'abord, voyons combien de cire d'abeille Charlie a besoin pour produire 20 bougies. 
   - Chaque bougie nécessite 1/10 de livre de cire d'abeille, donc 20 bougies nécessitent 20 * 1/10 = 2 livres de cire d'abeille.
   
2. Ensuite, voyons combien de mèches il a besoin pour produire 20 bougies. 
   - Il a besoin de 1 mèche par bougie, donc 20 bougies nécessitent 20 mèches.

Arrivée au travail, elle a placé une pensée sur chaque tasse de café de 220 tasses. Si par la suite il ne lui restait plus que 23 pensées, combien y avait-il de pensées dans le paquet qu'elle a acheté ?

Pour résoudre le problème, nous commençons par déterminer le nombre total de pensées qu'elle a utilisées. Elle a placé une pensée sur chaque tasse de café, donc elle a utilisé 220 pensées. Avant d'aller travailler, elle avait 80 pensées dans son sac à main. Après avoir acheté le paquet, elle en avait 23 restantes.

He already has 3 clients, but his discussion with 5 potential clients makes him confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client's house will require 2 bottles of Javel water and a pack of cloths for maintenance. He needs to spend $2 for each bottle of Javel water and $5 for each pack of cloths. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total weekly income will be $92. The profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses. How much profit, in dollars, will Kim make each week?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Number of clients:**
   - Initial clients: 3
   - Potential clients: 5
   - Total clients: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

2. **Expenses per client:**

Question: Jean owns a pineapple field of 10 hectares. Knowing that there are 100 pineapples per hectare and that Jean harvests all the pineapples every 3 months, how many can he harvest in a year?

Now, let's answer the question in French:
Question réponse en français:
Jean possède un champ de 10 hectares de mangues. En sachant qu'il y a 100 mangues par hectare et que Jean les récolte toutes les 3 mois, combien peut-il en récolter en un an ?

Pour répondre à la question, nous allons suivre ces étapes:

1. Calculer le nombre total de mangues dans le champ :
   Nombre de mangues par hectare = 100
   Nombre d'hectares = 10
   Total de mangues = 100 mangues/hectare × 10 hectares = 1000 mangues

2. Déterminer le nombre de récoltes par an :
   Jean récolte toutes les 3 mois, donc en un an (12 mois), il peut récolter :
   Nombre de récoltes par an = 12 mois / 3 mois par récolte = 4 récoltes

3. Calculer le nombre total de mangues récoltées en un an :
   Nombre de mangues par récolte = 1000 mangues
   Nombre de récoltes par an = 4
   Total de mangues par an = 1000 mangues × 4 récoltes = 4000 mangues

Finally, during the last 6 hours, all the bees that left and haven't returned yet return to the hive. How many bees has Debra seen returning to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day?

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: Half of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Next 6 hours**: Twice as many bees leave as those that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Last 6 hours**: All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and haven't returned yet return to the hive. Since 30 bees left and 15 returned, \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees are still out.

Therefore, during the last 6 hours, Debra has seen 15 bees return to the hive.

Steve lives 3 miles from the school and pedals at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school and skates at a speed of 264 feet per minute. How long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?

To solve this, we first need to convert the distances from miles to feet:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach the school:
- Time for Steve: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Tim takes longer to reach the school, so he is the loser. Steve is the winner and will wait for Tim.

Finally, we calculate how long Steve will wait:
- Time difference: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner will wait \(\boxed{4}\) minutes before the loser finishes the race.",4,4

Finally, one person came on a unicycle. How much money did she earn that day?

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Shawnda earned.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came, each with 2 tires.
   - Total tires for bicycles: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) tires.
   - Cost per tire: 25 cents.
   - Total cost for bicycles: \( 10 \times 0.25 = 2.50 \) dollars.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came, each with 3 tires.
   - Total tires for tricycles: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tires.
   - Cost per tire: 25 cents.
   - Total cost for tricycles: \( 9 \times 0.25 = 2.25 \) dollars.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came, with 1 tire.

mgsm-fr-153,"Question translated to English: Dave bought a big bag of fries and ate 14 of them before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hands. When the seagull landed, it ate half of the amount of fries that Dave had eaten. Then, three pigeons forced the seagull to leave and each of them could eat 3 fries. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving 5 fries. How many fries were in the bag when Dave bought it?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Fries eaten by Dave**: 14 fries.

2. **Fries eaten by the seagull**: Half of what Dave ate.
   \[
   \text{Fries eaten by the seagull} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Total fries eaten by Dave and the seagull**:
   \[
   14 + 7 = 21 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Remaining fries after the seagull**: 
   \[
   \text{Total fries} - 21 = \text{Remaining fries}
   \]

5. **Fries eaten by the three pigeons**: 
   \[
   3 \text{ pigeons} \times 3 \text{ fries each} = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Remaining fries after the pigeons**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} - 9 = \text{Remaining fries after pigeons}
   \]

7. **Fries eaten by the raccoon**: Two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after pigeons} \times \frac{2}{3}
   \]

8. **Remaining fries after the raccoon**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after pigeons} - \left( \text{Remaining fries after pigeons} \times \frac{2}{3} \right)
   \]

9. **Given that 5 fries were left after the raccoon**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after pigeons} - \left( \text{Remaining fries after pigeons} \times \frac{2}{3} \right) = 5
   \]

Let \( x \) be the remaining fries after the pigeons:
\[
x - \frac{2}{3}x = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 5
\]
\[
x = 15
\]

So, the remaining fries after the pigeons were 15. Now, we need to find the total fries before the raccoon:
\[
15 + \frac{2}{3} \times 15 = 15 + 10 = 25

Question: On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, student Kimo has three one-hour classes each day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two two-hour classes each day. If there are 16 weeks of school per semester, how many hours does Kimo spend on his classes during a semester?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

Pour résoudre le problème, nous devons d'abord calculer le nombre d'heures que Kimo passe à ses cours par semaine.

1. Sur les lundis, mercredis et vendredis, il a 3 cours d'une heure chacun, donc 3 heures par jour.

Each small bread measures 4 inches, each croissant 6 inches, and each baguette 2 feet. If Bill lines up all the bakery products end to end, what will their total length be in feet?

To solve the problem, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit (feet) and then sum them up.

1. Convert the length of the small breads from inches to feet:
   \[
   300 \text{ small breads} \times 4 \text{ inches/small bread} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}} = 300 \times \frac{4}{12} = 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Convert the length of the croissants from inches to feet:
   \[
   120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}} = 120 \times \frac{6}{12} = 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \text{ feet}

3. The length of the baguettes is already in feet:
   \[
   60 \text{ baguettes} \times 2 \text{ feet/baguette} = 120 \text{ feet}

4. Sum up all the lengths:
   \[
   100 \text{ feet} + 60 \text{ feet} + 120 \text{ feet} = 280 \text{ feet}

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost of the bag of balls is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. We need to calculate the cost after 36 months.

3. **Number of Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases in 36 months is:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Each increase is by 20%, which means the price after each increase is 120% of the previous price. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \text{Previous Price} \times 1.20
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: We start with the initial price and apply the 20% increase 18 times:

1. Calculer le montant manquant en faisant ses propres déclarations d'impôts:
   - 3 heures x $35 = $105

2. Calculer le montant total si elle engage un comptable:
   - $105 (manque à gagner en faisant ses propres déclarations) + $90 (coût de l'expert-comptable) = $195

3. La différence entre le coût de l'expert-comptable et le manque à gagner en faisant ses propres déclarations:
   - $195 - $90 = $105

La réponse en français est que Jackie aura en plus $\boxed{105}$.",105,15

She has a family budget of 1,500 € to spend and thinks she can save a little to buy herself a piece of clothing. She goes to an electronics store and chooses an equipment that costs 1090 € with a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse. She also buys a scanner for 157 €, a CD burner for 74 €, and a printer for 102 €. How much money will she have left for clothes?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Elvira purchased and then subtract this from her family budget.

1. Cost of the computer with accessories: 1090 €
2. Cost of the scanner: 157 €
3. Cost of the CD burner: 74 €
4. Cost of the printer: 102 €

Total cost of the items = 1090 € + 157 € + 74 € + 102 € = 1423 €

Elvira's family budget is 1500 €.

Money left for clothes = Family budget - Total cost of the items
Money left for clothes = 1500 € - 1423 € = 77 €

Therefore, Elvira will have $\boxed{77}$ € left for clothes.",77,77

Let's solve the problem:

1. Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan.
2. She needs to make 15 flans.
3. Therefore, she needs \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) eggs in total.
4. Each time she takes care of the child, she gets 9 eggs.
5. To find out how many times she must take care of the child, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time:

""Seth is 2 times older than Brooke. In two years, the sum of their ages will be 28 years. How old is Seth?""

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

Soit \( B \) l'âge de Brooke. Alors l'âge de Seth est \( 2B \).

Dans deux ans, l'âge de Brooke sera \( B + 2 \) et l'âge de Seth sera \( 2B + 2 \).

Selon l'énoncé, la somme de leurs âges dans deux ans est de 28 ans. Donc, nous avons l'équation :
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Résolvons cette équation :
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the vest is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the cost of the hat and the vest. The average is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Cost of hat} + \text{Cost of vest}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add the ages of the four birds:
\[4 \text{ (birds)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Thirty-two)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} = 55\]

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much should she pay in a year?

To answer this question, let's calculate the monthly payments if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum:

- Student loan: $300 + 50% of $300 = $300 + $150 = $450
- Credit card: $200 + 50% of $200 = $200 + $100 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 + 50% of $500 = $500 + $250 = $750

The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same time to peel and cut them. It takes Billy about 15 minutes to peel a potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long does it take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total time Billy spends peeling and cutting the potatoes.

1. Time to peel one potato: 15 minutes
2. Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we need to determine how many potatoes Billy has to peel and cut. Since he has 60 potatoes and it takes him 15 minutes to peel one, we can calculate the total time for peeling:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 15 \text{ minutes/potato} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time for cutting. Since it takes 5 seconds to cut one potato, we can calculate the total time for cutting:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we need to convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time for peeling and cutting to get the total time:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 905 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time Billy spends preparing the potatoes is:

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They produce 20 glasses of lemonade and sell each glass for $0.50. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

Soit \( x \) le nombre de gallons de limonade vendus. Ils ont donc \( 20 \) verres de limonade en tout.

Le coût total pour les citrons est de \( 3x \) dollars et le coût total pour le sucre est de \( 2x \) dollars. Donc, le coût total est de \( 3x + 2x = 5x \) dollars.

Leur revenu total est de \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.

Le bénéfice est donné par le revenu total moins le coût total, c'est-à-dire \( 10 - 5x = 25 \).

Résolvons cette équation pour \( x \):
\[ 10 - 5x = 25 \]
\[ -5x = 15 \]
\[ x = -3 \]

Il semble qu'il y ait une erreur dans l'interprétation du problème. En réalité, le bénéfice est de $25, donc nous devons résoudre l'équation correctement:
\[ 10 - 5x = 25 \]
\[ -5x = 15 \]

He gives $200 to his daughter for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for grocery shopping and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 per month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total expenses and donations:**
   - Zaid's monthly salary: $6,000
   - Rent: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500\)
   - Car fuel: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000\)
   - Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: \(6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500\)
   - Amount given to charity: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250\)
   - Amount given to daughter: $200

Jerry rolls a six-sided die. What is the probability (in percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 more times than an even number in two consecutive rolls?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

   - A six-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
   - Numbers greater than 3: 4, 5, 6 (3 outcomes).
   - Even numbers: 2, 4, 6 (3 outcomes).
   - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5 (3 outcomes).

2. **Calculate the probabilities for each event:**
   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \( P(\text{>3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Probability of rolling an even number: \( P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the probability of both events happening in two consecutive rolls:**
   - Probability of both events happening (number greater than 3 and even number): \( P(\text{>3 and even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Calculate the probability of only one of the events happening in two consecutive rolls:**
   - Probability of only the number greater than 3 happening: \( P(\text{>3 only}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \).
   - Probability of only the even number happening: \( P(\text{even only}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \).

Rats are divided into 3 cages with equal-sized groups and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 hamster cages, each with one hamster and 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit enclosure where 20 pieces of straw are distributed. No straw is used elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed to the rodents, how many rats are there in each cage?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of rats.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 6n \).
   - We know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rodents is 160.
   - Hence, we set up the equation: \( 6n = 160 \).

2. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   6n = 160
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{160}{6} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67
   \]
   Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem context. Given the context, it seems the problem might have a misinterpretation or a typo. Let's assume the problem meant to distribute 180 pieces of straw instead of 160.

3. **Revised calculation with 180 pieces of straw:**
   \[
   6n = 180
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{180}{6} = 30
   \]

   - There are 3 cages for the rats.
   - Therefore, the number of rats per cage is:

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total number of slices needed and then determine how many pizzas are required.

1. Calculate the total number of slices needed:
   - Jean has 20 friends.
   - Each friend should get 4 slices.
   - Total slices needed = 20 friends × 4 slices/friend = 80 slices.

2. Determine the number of pizzas required:
   - Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
   - Total slices needed = 80 slices.
   - Number of pizzas required = Total slices needed ÷ Slices per pizza = 80 slices ÷ 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, Jean must order $\boxed{10}$ pizzas.",10,10
mgsm-fr-236,"Question translated to English: Ram uses many pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink is exhausted, how many pens will he have in total?

Let's solve the problem step by step in French:

1. Ram commence avec 25 stylos.
2. Chaque fois qu'un stylo est utilisé, il peut en faire un nouveau en mélangeant l'encre de cinq stylos vides.
3. Pour obtenir un nouveau stylo, il utilise 5 stylos vides.
4. Donc, pour obtenir un nouveau stylo, il perd 5 stylos.
5. Si Ram a 25 stylos initiaux, il peut en faire $\frac{25}{5} = 5$ nouveaux stylos.
6. Après avoir fabriqué ces 5 nouveaux stylos, il reste 25 - 5 = 20 stylos.
7. Il peut maintenant utiliser ces 20 stylos pour fabriquer encore 4 nouveaux stylos (car 4 fois 5 fait 20).
8. Après avoir fabriqué ces 4 nouveaux stylos, il reste 20 - 4 = 16 stylos.
9. Il peut maintenant utiliser ces 16 stylos pour fabriquer encore 3 nouveaux stylos.
10. Après avoir fabriqué ces 3 nouveaux stylos, il reste 16 - 3 = 13 stylos.
11. Il peut maintenant utiliser ces 13 stylos pour fabriquer encore 2 nouveaux stylos.
12. Après avoir fabriqué ces 2 nouveaux stylos, il reste 13 - 2 = 11 stylos.
13. Il peut maintenant utiliser ces 11 stylos pour fabriquer encore 2 nouveaux stylos.
14. Après avoir fabriqué ces 2 nouveaux stylos, il reste 11 - 2 = 9 stylos.
15. Il peut maintenant utiliser ces 9 stylos pour fabriquer encore 1 nouveau stylo.
16. Après avoir fabriqué ce dernier stylo, il ne reste plus de stylos.

En total, Ram obtiendra donc 25 (initiaux) + 5 (premiers nouveaux) + 4 (deuxièmes nouveaux) + 3 (troisièmes nouveaux) + 2 (quatrièmes nouveaux) + 2 (cinquièmes nouveaux) + 1 (sixième nouveau) = 42 stylos.

Now, let's solve the problem in French.

1. Total number of students: 1000
2. Percentage of students leaving through exit A: 30%
3. Fraction of students leaving through exit B: \( \frac{3}{5} \)

First, calculate the number of students leaving through exit A:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

Next, calculate the number of students leaving through exit B:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{3}{5} \times 1000 = 600 \]

Now, determine the number of students leaving through exit C. The total number of students is 1000, and we know the number of students leaving through exits A and B:
\[ \text{Number of students leaving through exit C} = 1000 - (\text{Number of students leaving through exit A} + \text{Number of students leaving through exit B}) \]
\[ \text{Number of students leaving through exit C} = 1000 - (300 + 600) = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Mike originally had 5 correspondents.
2. He then stopped corresponding with 2, leaving him with 3 correspondents.
3. Each of the remaining 3 correspondents sends 2 letters of 5 pages each week. Therefore, the total number of pages sent by all correspondents each week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ correspondents} \times 2 \text{ letters per correspondent} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}

4. Mike writes one page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time in minutes to write 30 pages is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Kyle took 5 fries.
2. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
3. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
4. After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(24 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 fries less than Kyle, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
6. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(24 + x - 2 = 22 + x\) fries.
7. We are given that Griffin had 27 fries at the end, so:

She has to do it 4 times a week. The film lasts 5 weeks. After the film is finished, the makeup artist gives Jeanne a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. How much did Jeanne pay in total?

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours needed for the makeup:**
   - Makeup required per day: 6 hours
   - Makeup required per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If one cookie contains 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume compared to her sister?

First, let's determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister: 
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more cookies than her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Total cookies eaten by Sue:

If her flock has 20 chickens, how many bowls of food must she give them for the last meal of the day?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of food given for the first two meals and then determine how many bowls are left for the last meal.

1. Calculate the total number of bowls given in the morning and afternoon:
   - Morning: \(15 \text{ bowls} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 300 \text{ bowls}\)
   - Afternoon: \(25 \text{ bowls} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 500 \text{ bowls}\)

Carla then has to start the download over from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total file size and the speed of download:**
   - Total file size: \( 200 \, \text{GB} \)
   - Download speed: \( 2 \, \text{GB/min} \)

2. **Calculate the time to download the entire file without interruptions:**
   \[
   \text{Time to download} = \frac{\text{Total file size}}{\text{Download speed}} = \frac{200 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/min}} = 100 \, \text{minutes}
   \]

3. **Account for the interruption due to Windows updates:**
   - Time taken for the interruption: \( 20 \, \text{minutes} \)

4. **Calculate the time Carla has spent downloading before the interruption:**
   - Since the interruption happens at 40% completion, we need to find out how long it took to reach 40% of the file size.
   - 40% of the file size: \( 0.4 \times 200 \, \text{GB} = 80 \, \text{GB} \)
   - Time to download 80 GB: \( \frac{80 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/min}} = 40 \, \text{minutes} \)

5. **Calculate the remaining time to download the rest of the file:**

\[ 40 \text{ heures} \times 10 \text{ $/heure} = 400 \text{ $} \]

2. For the 5 overtime hours (since she worked 45 hours in total), her overtime rate is:
\[ 1.2 \times 10 \text{ $/heure} = 12 \text{ $/heure} \]
So, her overtime salary is:
\[ 5 \text{ heures} \times 12 \text{ $/heure} = 60 \text{ $} \]

3. Adding both parts of her salary:
\[ 400 \text{ $} + 60 \text{ $} = 460 \text{ $} \]

Therefore, Élisa's weekly salary is $\boxed{460}$.",460,460
polymath-low-fr-10,"Question translated to English: A new program was downloaded 60 times during the first month. The number of downloads during the second month was three times the number from the first month. It then decreased by 30% during the third month. How many times in total has the program been downloaded over these three months?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   \[
   \text{First month downloads} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month:
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month decreased by 30% from the second month:
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Summing up the downloads from all three months:
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of times the program was downloaded over these three months is $\boxed{366}$.",366,366

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. Cost of waffles: 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204
2. Cost of small cakes: 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160
3. Cost of cheese cakes: 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

polymath-low-fr-12,"First, let's translate the question into English:
Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The cost of planting is $90. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons that will be sold at $1.50 each. The watering and nutrition of the tree cost $3 per year. How many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree?

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Calculer le coût total annuel du citronnier:
   - Coût de plantation : $90
   - Coût d'arrosage et de nutrition : $3
   - Total annuel : $90 + $3 = $93

2. Calculer le revenu annuel du citronnier:
   - Nombre de citrons : 7
   - Prix par citron : $1,50
   - Total annuel : 7 x $1,50 = $10,50

3. Calculer le bénéfice annuel:
   - Bénéfice annuel = Revenu annuel - Coût annuel
   - Bénéfice annuel = $10,50 - $93 = $-82,50

4. Comprendre que le bénéfice est négatif, donc Carlos ne gagne pas d'argent en 1 an.
   - Pour commencer à gagner de l'argent, Carlos doit avoir un bénéfice positif.

5. Calculer le nombre d'années nécessaires pour que le bénéfice devienne positif:
   - Pour que le bénéfice soit positif, le revenu annuel doit être supérieur au coût annuel.
   - Pour que le bénéfice soit positif, le revenu annuel doit être supérieur à $93.
   - Le revenu annuel est de $10,50 par an.
   - Le coût annuel est de $93 par an.

   Il n'y a pas de nombre d'années négatif qui fait que le bénéfice devient positif. Donc, Carlos ne gagnera jamais d'argent avec son citronnier.

The final number is $\boxed{0}$",0,13

During her visit to the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, then 2 more to the red house, and finally half of what was left to the orange house. If there are 5 vacuum cleaners left to Melanie, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at the beginning?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the beginning.
2. After selling a third to the green house, she has \( \frac{2}{3}x \) left.
3. Then she sells 2 more to the red house, so she has \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) left.
4. Finally, she sells half of the remaining vacuum cleaners to the orange house, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \) left.
5. According to the problem, this final number is 5, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. Solve the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 18

polymath-low-fr-15,"Question translated to English: A merchant is considering two purchasing plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% and the electronic gadgets market will increase by 1.2% within the same month. If the merchant chooses the option that maximizes his profit at the end of the month, what would be the amount of this profit?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the profit from the jewelry:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Expected increase: 2.5%
   - Increase amount: \( 5,000 \times 0.025 = 125 \)
   - Final value: \( 5,000 + 125 = 5,125 \)
   - Profit from jewelry: \( 5,125 - 5,000 = 125 \)

2. **Calculate the profit from the electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value of gadgets: $8,000
   - Expected increase: 1.2%
   - Increase amount: \( 8,000 \times 0.012 = 96 \)
   - Final value: \( 8,000 + 96 = 8,096 \)
   - Profit from gadgets: \( 8,096 - 8,000 = 96 \)

3. **Compare the profits:**
   - Profit from jewelry: $125
   - Profit from gadgets: $96

Since the profit from the jewelry ($125) is greater than the profit from the electronic gadgets ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit.

Therefore, the amount of the profit would be \(\boxed{125}\).",125,125

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Claire uses 3 eggs each morning.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are:
   \[
   4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days}

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) must she maintain to cover the remaining distance?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Total Distance**: The total trail length is 12 miles.
2. **Distance Covered in the First 6 Miles**:
   - First 4 miles: 4 miles in 1 hour.
   - Next 2 miles: 2 miles in 1 hour.
   - Total distance covered in the first 6 miles: 4 + 2 = 6 miles.
3. **Remaining Distance**: 
   - Total distance - Distance covered in the first 6 miles = 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
4. **Time to Cover the Remaining Distance**:
   - Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.
   - To find the time required to cover the remaining 6 miles at 4 miles per hour:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
5. **Total Time for the Entire Trail**:
   - Time taken for the first 6 miles: 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
   - Time required to cover the remaining 6 miles: 1.5 hours.
   - Total time for the entire trail: 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours.
6. **Required Speed for the Remaining Distance**:
   - Distance remaining: 6 miles.
   - Total time for the entire trail: 3.5 hours.
   - Required speed to cover the remaining distance in 1.5 hours:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}

""I have 10 liters of orange juice made up of two-thirds water. In order to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice made up of three-quarters water, I accidentally spill one liter of orange juice. How much water is there in the remaining 24 liters?""

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

1. Initially, we have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water. Therefore, the amount of water in the orange juice is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}
   \]
   The amount of orange juice without water is:
   \[
   10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ liters}
   \]

2. We also have 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-quarters water. Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple juice is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} \text{ liters}
   \]
   The amount of pineapple juice without water is:
   \[
   15 - \frac{45}{4} = \frac{60}{4} - \frac{45}{4} = \frac{15}{4} \text{ liters}
   \]

3. After spilling one liter of orange juice, we have:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters of orange juice}
   \]
   The amount of water in the remaining orange juice is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{19}{3} \text{ liters}
   \]

4. The total amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange juice and 15 liters of pineapple juice is:
   \[
   \frac{19}{3} + \frac{45}{4} = \frac{19 \times 4 + 45 \times 3}{12} = \frac{76 + 135}{12} = \frac{211}{12} \text{ liters}

If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, what is, in dollars, the price of the boots?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the price of the boots be \( B \) dollars.
2. The price of the first pair of high heels is $33.
3. The price of the second pair of high heels is twice that of the first pair, so it is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
4. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
5. According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

The ages of Darell and Allen are in the ratio 7:11. If the sum of their current ages is 162, calculate how old Allen will be in 10 years.

Now, let's solve the problem in French:

Soit \( x \) l'âge de Darell et \( y \) l'âge d'Allen. On sait que :
1. La somme de leurs âges est de 162 : \( x + y = 162 \).
2. Leur ratio d'âge est de 7:11 : \( \frac{x}{y} = \frac{7}{11} \).

D'abord, résolvons l'équation du ratio :
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{7}{11} \implies 11x = 7y \implies x = \frac{7}{11}y

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **First estimation**: 80
2. **Second estimation**: 20 more than half of the first.
   - Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \).
   - 20 more than 40 is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
3. **Third estimation**: 25% more than the first.
   - 25% of 80 is \( \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20 \).
   - 25% more than 80 is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).

Now, we have the estimations: 80, 60, and 100.

4. **Calculate the average**:
   - Sum of the estimations: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \).
   - Number of estimations: 3.
   - Average: \( \frac{240}{3} = 80 \).

The average of their estimations is \( \boxed{80} \).",80,80
