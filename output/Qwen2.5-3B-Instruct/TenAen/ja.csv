mgsm-ja-47,"Translation: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, which cost 50% more than the blue ties. He spent $40 on each blue tie and a total of $200 on them. How much did he spend on the ties in total?

To solve this, first, we need to determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of one red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, the cost of one red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = \text{Cost of one blue tie} \times (1 + 50\%) = 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the red ties. John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total cost for the red ties is:

\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of one red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent a total of $800 on the ties.

Enclosed in $\\boxed{}$ is the final number: $\\boxed{800}$.",800,800
mgsm-ja-48,"Translation: Tracy used a 4-foot long wire to support tomato seedlings in the garden. Now, the wire is cut into pieces that are 6 inches long. How many pieces of wire did she buy?

To solve this, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so a 4-foot wire is 4 * 12 = 48 inches long.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy bought: 48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces of wire Tracy bought is $\\boxed{8}$.",8,8
mgsm-ja-49,"Translation: Richard lives in an 15-story building. Each floor has 8 rooms, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. How many rooms are vacant in the building in total?

To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of rooms in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 rooms, the total number of rooms is 15 * 8 = 120 rooms.

Next, we calculate the number of occupied rooms. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied rooms is 3/4 * 120 = 90 rooms.

Finally, to find the number of vacant rooms, we subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total number of rooms: 120 - 90 = 30 rooms.

Therefore, the total number of vacant rooms is \\boxed{30}.",30,30
mgsm-ja-50,"Translation: Lloyd has a farm for raising chickens. His chickens lay 252 eggs a day, and he sells them by the dozen for $2. How much money can Lloyd make from selling eggs in a week?

To calculate the weekly earnings from selling eggs, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs sold per day:
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 252 eggs per day is equivalent to \( \frac{252}{12} = 21 \) dozens per day.

2. Calculate the daily earnings:
   - Selling 21 dozens at $2 per dozen gives \( 21 \times 2 = 42 \) dollars per day.

3. Calculate the weekly earnings:
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly earnings are \( 42 \times 7 = 294 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Lloyd can make from selling eggs in a week is \\boxed{294}.",294,294
mgsm-ja-51,"Translation: Tom's ship can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM. After that, he returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour. How long will it take him to return?

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled during his sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM. He sailed for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

After returning, he travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to cover the 30 miles back, we use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the total time it takes Tom to return is 5 hours.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculate the weight of the 30 comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
   - Therefore, 30 comic books weigh \( 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \) pounds.

2. **Determine the remaining weight to be removed:**
   - The total weight to be removed is 15 pounds.
   - After removing the comic books, \( 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \) pounds remain.

3. **Calculate the number of toys to be removed:**
   - Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
   - To find the number of toys, divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy: \( \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \) toys.

Therefore, the number of toys that need to be removed is $\\boxed{15}$.",15,15
mgsm-ja-53,"Question in English: The mechanic charges different rates for repairing tires on trucks and cars. The mechanic charges $60 for each tire repair on a truck and $40 for each tire repair on a car. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 sets of truck tires and 4 sets of car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 tires in total, but did not repair any truck tires. How much more profit did the mechanic make on the day he earned more?

Let's calculate the profit for each day:

Thursday:
- Truck tires: 6 sets * $60/set = $360
- Car tires: 4 sets * $40/set = $160
- Total profit on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Friday:
- Car tires: 12 sets * $40/set = $480
- Truck tires: 0 sets * $60/set = $0
- Total profit on Friday: $480

Now, let's compare the profits:
- Thursday profit: $520
- Friday profit: $480

The difference in profit between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the mechanic made $\\boxed{40}$ more profit on Thursday.",40,40
mgsm-ja-54,"Question: When the mother told the sisters by phone that their two cats at home had given birth to kittens, they drove to their home with seven kittens they had adopted from the local shelter. The mother says that the first cat, Patch, gave birth to three times as many kittens as were adopted, and the other cat, Trixie, gave birth to 12 kittens. How many kittens are there in the Dowtail Fire family now?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of kittens adopted from the shelter.
2. According to the problem, the first cat, Patch, gave birth to \( 3x \) kittens.
3. The second cat, Trixie, gave birth to 12 kittens.

The total number of kittens in the family is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from both cats:
\[ x + 3x + 12 = 7 \]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[ 4x + 12 = 7 \]
\[ 4x = 7 - 12 \]
\[ 4x = -5 \]
\[ x = -\frac{5}{4} \]

Since the number of kittens cannot be negative or a fraction, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The total number of adopted kittens should be a positive integer. Let's recheck the problem statement and calculations.

Given:
- Adopted kittens: \( x \)
- Kittens from Patch: \( 3x \)
- Kittens from Trixie: 12

Total:
\[ x + 3x + 12 = 7 \]
\[ 4x + 12 = 7 \]
\[ 4x = 7 - 12 \]
\[ 4x = -5 \]

This indicates an inconsistency. Let's assume the problem meant to say the total number of adopted kittens is 7, and re-evaluate:

If \( x = 1 \):
\[ 1 + 3(1) + 12 = 1 + 3 + 12 = 16 \]

Thus, the correct total number of kittens in the Dowtail Fire family is:

mgsm-ja-57,"Question: The wooden bridge cannot withstand more than 5000 pounds. Each delivery truck carries 15-pound boxes in 33 boxes and tries to cross the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Let's denote the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry as \( n \).

The weight of each box is 15 pounds, so the total weight of \( n \) boxes is \( 15n \) pounds. The total weight of the truck, including the boxes, is \( 3755 + 15n \) pounds. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. Therefore, we have the inequality:

\[ 3755 + 15n \leq 5000 \]

To find the maximum \( n \), we solve the inequality:

\[ 15n \leq 5000 - 3755 \]
\[ 15n \leq 1245 \]
\[ n \leq \frac{1245}{15} \]
\[ n \leq 83 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry is 83.

Since it was delivered through a delivery company, they added a 25% service charge to the final total, which included a delivery fee of $3.00. Steven also added a $4.00 tip. What was the final cost of Steven's grocery order after adding the extra charges?

Answer:
To find the final cost of Steven's grocery order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the 25% service charge on the $40.00 bill.
2. Add the $3.00 delivery fee to the bill.
3. Add the $4.00 tip.

First, calculate the 25% service charge:

mgsm-ja-60,"Translation: There are 1 rotten orange, 20% that are still green, 2 that are sour, and the rest are in good condition in the basket. How many oranges are in good condition?

Let's denote the total number of oranges as \( x \).

Given:
- 1 rotten orange
- 20% of \( x \) are still green
- 2 sour oranges
- The rest are in good condition

The number of good oranges can be expressed as:
\[ x - 1 - 0.2x - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x - 1 - 0.2x - 2 = 0.8x - 3 \]

We know that the remaining oranges are in good condition, which is given as 25:
\[ 0.8x - 3 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 0.8x = 28 \]
\[ x = \frac{28}{0.8} \]
\[ x = 35 \]

1. Cost of materials: $500
2. Cost of having it made: $800
3. Insurance cost: 10% of $500 = 0.10 * $500 = $50

mgsm-ja-62,"Question: If Masha works for the same company for 40 years, she will receive a pension of $50,000 per year. Starting from 20 years later, she will be able to receive a pension of 5% per year. How much will her pension be per year if she retires after 30 years?

To solve this, we first need to determine the pension amount after 20 years, which is the starting point for the 5% annual increase.

1. Calculate the pension amount after 20 years:
   - Let the initial pension amount be \( P \).
   - After 20 years, the pension amount increases by 5% annually.
   - The formula for the pension amount after \( t \) years with an annual increase of \( r \) is: \( P \times (1 + r)^t \).

2. Given that after 20 years, the pension amount is $50,000:
   \[
   P \times (1 + 0.05)^{20} = 50,000
   \]
   \[
   P \times (1.05)^{20} = 50,000
   \]

3. Calculate \( (1.05)^{20} \):
   \[
   (1.05)^{20} \approx 2.6533
   \]

4. Solve for \( P \):
   \[
   P \times 2.6533 = 50,000
   \]
   \[
   P = \frac{50,000}{2.6533} \approx 18,840
   \]

5. Now, calculate the pension amount after 30 years:
   \[
   P \times (1.05)^{30}
   \]
   \[
   (1.05)^{30} \approx 4.3219
   \]

6. Calculate the pension amount at 30 years:
   \[
   18,840 \times 4.3219 \approx 81,297
   \]

Therefore, if Masha retires after 30 years, her pension will be approximately $81,297 per year.

For the first half of the year, she pays for all of it, and for the second half, the streaming service provides it to her at a 10% discount. Calculate the total amount Ariana has paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

To solve this, let's break it down:

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - Cost per month = $140.
   - Total cost for the first half = $140 * 6 = $840.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - Cost per month with 10% discount = $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126.
   - Total cost for the second half = $126 * 6 = $756.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Total cost = First half cost + Second half cost = $840 + $756 = $1596.

She has driven 100 miles since her last full tank, and it took 4 gallons to refill the tank. The owner's manual of the car states that a full tank holds 12 gallons. How many miles can Sofia drive on a full tank of gas?

To solve this, we first determine how many miles Sofia can drive per gallon of gas. She drove 100 miles on 4 gallons, so the miles per gallon (mpg) is:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Since a full tank holds 12 gallons, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:

If he builds a sand castle with 4 levels and the top level is 16 square feet, what is the average size of each level?

Let's denote the size of the top level as \( S_1 = 16 \) square feet. Since each subsequent level is half the size of the level below it, we can calculate the sizes of the other levels as follows:

- The second level \( S_2 = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- The third level \( S_3 = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
- The fourth level \( S_4 = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

To find the average size of each level, we sum the sizes of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

mgsm-ja-76,"Question: Cesira just bought a new puppy. According to her vet, she needs to give the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. After that, for the remaining lifespan of the dog, she needs to give 2 cups of dog food every day. If a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cesira need for the first year?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days and then for the remaining days in the first year.

For the first 180 days:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining days in the first year (365 - 180 = 185 days):
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Total dog food needed for the first year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food are needed:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, the number of bags of dog food Cesira will need for the first year is $\\boxed{5}$.",5,5
mgsm-ja-77,"Translation: If Raymond washes half the amount that Sarah washed, and Sarah washed the same amount as David, and Sarah washed 400 pounds, then how much more or less does Raymond's and David's washing differ?

Let's denote the amount David washed as D pounds. Since Sarah washed the same amount as David, Sarah also washed D pounds. Raymond washed half the amount Sarah washed, so Raymond washed D/2 pounds.

The total amount washed by Sarah and David is:
\[ D + D = 2D \]

Given that Sarah washed 400 pounds, we have:
\[ D = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount washed by Sarah and David is:
\[ 2D = 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ pounds} \]

Since Raymond washed D/2 pounds:
\[ \text{Raymond's washing} = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

The difference in the amount washed by Raymond and David is:
\[ 800 - 200 = 600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount washed by Raymond and David is $\\boxed{600}$.",600,100
mgsm-ja-78,"Translation: Vincent can buy flowers in either a package of $2.50 for 3 flowers or a package of $1 for 2 flowers. If he buys 18 flowers at the cheaper price, how much money will he save?

To solve this, we need to calculate the cost per flower for both packages and then determine the total cost for 18 flowers in each scenario.

1. Cost per flower for the $2.50 package: $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower
2. Cost per flower for the $1 package: $1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 is cheaper than $0.8333, Vincent should buy the $1 package to get the better deal.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the cheaper price:
18 flowers * $0.50/flower = $9.00

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the original price, we need to calculate the cost for both packages and compare them:

1. Cost for 18 flowers at the $2.50/3 flowers package: 
18 flowers / 3 flowers/package * $2.50/package = 6 packages * $2.50/package = $15.00

2. Cost for 18 flowers at the $1/2 flowers package:
18 flowers / 2 flowers/package * $1/package = 9 packages * $1/package = $9.00

The difference in cost between buying 18 flowers at the original price and the cheaper price is:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent will save $\\boxed{6}$.",6,6

Let's denote the number of matches they lost as \( L \) and the number of matches they won as \( W \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of matches played is 22:
   \[
   L + W = 22

2. They won 8 more matches than they lost:
   \[
   W = L + 8

Different vacation blocks are used in each row. She has been going on 4 vacations a year since she was 23 years old. She is now 34 years old. How many quilt blocks are there in total?

To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of vacations Jean has taken since she was 23 and until she is 34.

First, we calculate the number of years she has been going on vacations:
34 - 23 = 11 years

Since she has been going on 4 vacations each year, the total number of vacations is:
11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations

Each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, so the total number of quilt blocks is 44.

When the second alarm rang, it rang for 3 times as long as the first one. When the third alarm rang, it rang for half the time of the second alarm. How many times in total did the alarm ring?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first alarm rang 4 times.
2. The second alarm rang for 3 times as long as the first alarm, which means it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third alarm rang for half the time of the second alarm, which means it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we add up the total number of times the alarm rang:

To find out how much Christina will spend, we first need to determine how many guests will actually come to the party. Since 1/4 of the 16 friends will not come, that means 3/4 of the friends will attend. 

\[ \text{Number of guests} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Each guest will receive 0.75 gift bags.

\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags by the cost per bag.

From the problem, we have:
1. A = J + 5
2. A = C + 2
3. G = 10
4. C = G - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9

Since A = C + 2, we substitute C = 9:

However, halfway through, her Windows updates and restart takes 20 minutes. Afterward, Carla had to start the download from the beginning. How long will it take to download the file?

First, we calculate the amount of data already downloaded:
\[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 40\% = 200 \times 0.4 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, we determine the time taken to download the initial 80 GB at the normal speed:

3. The remaining vacuum cleaners after selling to the green and red houses would be \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange houses, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} (\frac{2x}{3} - 2) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners in the orange houses.
5. After selling to the green, red, and orange houses, the number of vacuum cleaners left would be \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - (\frac{x}{3} - 1) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).

According to the problem, she has five vacuum cleaners left at the end of the sale. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with $\\boxed{18}$ vacuum cleaners.",18,18

mgsm-ja-20,"Translation: There is 10 liters of orange juice that makes up 2/3 of it. The plan is to add 15 liters of pineapple drink that makes up 3/5 of it. While pouring, 1 liter of orange juice is accidentally spilled. How much of the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is water?

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Calculate the amount of water and orange juice in the original 10 liters of orange juice:
   - Water in orange juice = 10 * (1 - 2/3) = 10 * (1/3) = 10/3 liters
   - Orange juice in orange juice = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

2. Calculate the amount of water and pineapple juice in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
   - Water in pineapple drink = 15 * (1 - 3/5) = 15 * (2/5) = 6 liters
   - Pineapple juice in pineapple drink = 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

3. After spilling 1 liter of orange juice, the remaining orange juice is:
   - Remaining orange juice = 20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters

4. The total volume of the mixture after adding the remaining orange juice and the pineapple drink:
   - Total volume = 17/3 + 6 + 9 = 17/3 + 15 = 52/3 liters

5. The total amount of water in the mixture:
   - Water from orange juice = 10/3 liters
   - Water from pineapple drink = 6 liters
   - Total water = 10/3 + 6 = 10/3 + 18/3 = 28/3 liters

6. The percentage of water in the final mixture:
   - Water percentage = (28/3) / (52/3) * 100 = 28/52 * 100 = 53.85%

7. Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture:
   - Water in 24 liters = 24 * (53.85/100) = 24 * 0.5385 = 12.924 liters

Dana can run at four times the speed she walks, but she can skip at half the speed she runs. If she can skip 3 miles in an hour, how many kilometers can she cover in 6 hours if she runs for one-third of the time and walks for the other two-thirds?

Let's solve it step by step:

1. **Determine the running speed:**
   - Dana can skip 3 miles in an hour.
   - Running speed is four times the skipping speed.
   - Running speed = 4 * skipping speed = 4 * 3 miles/hour = 12 miles/hour.

2. **Determine the walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times the walking speed.
   - Walking speed = running speed / 4 = 12 miles/hour / 4 = 3 miles/hour.

3. **Calculate the distance covered in one-third of the time (2 hours):**
   - Running speed = 12 miles/hour.
   - Time = 2 hours.
   - Distance covered while running = 12 miles/hour * 2 hours = 24 miles.

4. **Calculate the distance covered in two-thirds of the time (4 hours):**

- Total cost for 20 candles: $1.00 * 20 = $20.00

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:
- Selling price per candle: $2.00
- Total revenue for 20 candles: $2.00 * 20 = $40.00

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Net profit: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

Therefore, the net profit Charlie would make if he sells 20 candles is $\\boxed{20}$.",20,20
mgsm-ja-45,"Question in English:
Meredis writes about health topics and is a freelance blogger whose main job is to submit daily blog posts to her clients. It takes her, on average, 4 hours to research and write each blog post. Last week, on Monday, she wrote 5 posts. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times as many posts as she did on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many posts as she did on Tuesday. How many hours did she spend in total writing posts over these three days?

Let's calculate the number of posts she wrote each day:
- Monday: 5 posts
- Tuesday: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \) posts
- Wednesday: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) posts

Now, let's calculate the total number of posts she wrote over the three days:
Total posts = 5 (Monday) + 2 (Tuesday) + 4 (Wednesday) = 11 posts

Since it takes her 4 hours to write each post:
Total hours spent writing = 11 posts \(\times\) 4 hours/post = 44 hours

The total number of hours she spent writing posts over these three days is \\boxed{44}.",44,104
mgsm-ja-46,"Question in English: Candice put 80 sticky notes in her bag before going to the coffee shop. On her way there, she stopped by the shop and bought a pack of sticky notes. At her workplace, she stuck one sticky note on each of 220 different coffee cups. If she had 23 sticky notes left, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Candice originally had 80 sticky notes.
2. She used some of these sticky notes to stick on the coffee cups, which means she used 220 sticky notes.
3. After using these 220 sticky notes, she had 23 sticky notes left.

To find out how many sticky notes she bought, we add the sticky notes she used to the sticky notes she had left:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Therefore, the pack she bought contained 243 sticky notes.

mgsm-ja-94,"Question: In the neighborhood, there are 12 fewer pet rabbits than the total number of pets which are dogs and cats combined. There are twice as many cats as dogs, and if there are 60 dogs, how many pets are there in total in the neighborhood?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let \( R \) be the number of rabbits.
2. Let \( D \) be the number of dogs, which is given as 60.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of cats.

From the problem, we know:
- \( R = D - 12 \) (since there are 12 fewer rabbits than the total number of dogs and cats)
- \( C = 2D \) (there are twice as many cats as dogs)

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equations:
- \( R = 60 - 12 = 48 \)
- \( C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \)

The total number of pets \( P \) is the sum of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
\[ P = R + D + C = 48 + 60 + 120 = 228 \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{228}\).",228,348

mgsm-ja-97,"Question: When Frida makes sauce with canned tomatoes, the volume is halved. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. The last batch of tomato sauce contained 32 ounces. How many tomatoes did Frida use?

To solve this, we first need to determine the volume of the last batch of tomato sauce before it was halved. Since the last batch is 32 ounces, before halving it would have been 64 ounces. 

Given that each can of 16 ounces contains 3 tomatoes, to find out how many cans were used for 64 ounces, we divide 64 by 16, which equals 4 cans. 

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, 4 cans will contain 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Frida used 12 tomatoes.

There are several cars lined up on the highway. Some of them drove during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, while the next 20 cars drove during the remaining 15 minutes. Five cars left the traffic jam without driving through it, starting from the exit. If originally there were 30 cars on the highway, how many cars drove during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam?

Let's break it down:
- Let's denote the number of cars that drove during the first 15 minutes as x.
- The next 20 cars drove during the remaining 15 minutes.
- The 5 cars that left the traffic jam did not drive during the traffic jam.

The total number of cars is 30, so we can write the equation:

She already has 40 pots in each of her 40 windowsills at her spacious countryside house. Inspired by her enthusiasm, she decided to give one pot to each of her friends and family members tomorrow. How many pots will Marie have left?

Let's calculate:
1. Marie initially had 40 pots in each of her 40 windowsills, so she had 40 * 40 = 1600 pots.
2. She received 18 more pots from the nursery.
3. She plans to give away 40 pots (one to each of her 40 friends and family members).

So, the total number of pots she will have given away is 40 (already owned) + 18 (received) = 58 pots.
Therefore, the number of pots Marie will have left is 1600 (initial pots) + 18 (new pots) - 58 (pots given away) = 1660 - 58 = 1602 pots.

The number of pots Marie will have left is \\boxed{1602}.",1602,58

While taking them out to cool, he removes 5 cookies, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake this year as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After removing 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies this year. Since he actually baked twice as many as last year, let's denote the number of cookies he baked last year as \( y \). Therefore:

\[ 2y = 50 \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = 25 \]

To solve this, we can calculate the total distance Julia paddled and then determine the total amount of water that entered the boat.

Julia paddled 64 feet to the shore. For every 10 feet, 2 liters of water entered the boat. So, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 64 feet.

\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 6.4 \text{ segments} \]

Since each segment results in 2 liters of water entering the boat, we multiply the number of segments by 2 liters per segment:

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Let the number of photos Jamal's phone can save be J.
2. According to the question, J = 1800.
3. Let the number of photos Brittany's phone can save be B.
4. According to the question, B = 6 * J.

Let's calculate the total cost and the total selling price:
- Cost of 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $10 = $100
- Cost of 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $16 = $80
- Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Now, let's calculate the total selling price:
- Selling price of 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150 (since the price increased by 50%, the new price is $10 * 1.5 = $15)
- Selling price of 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 * $20 = $100 (since the price increased by 50%, the new price is $16 * 1.5 = $24, but we are selling at the increased price, so $20)
- Total selling price: $150 + $100 = $250

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Adrian's initial salary 4 years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrian's salary increased by 30% in 4 years to $40,000 + 30% of $40,000 = $40,000 + $12,000 = $52,000.
3. If Adrian's salary increased by 40% in 4 years, we calculate the new salary as $52,000 + 40% of $52,000 = $52,000 + $20,800 = $72,800.
4. Since Adrian andリア's salaries increased simultaneously, we assumeリア's salary also increased by 30% and then by 40%.
5. Letリア's initial salary 4 years ago be $X.
6.リア's salary 4 years ago increased by 30% to $X + 30% of $X = $X + 0.3X = 1.3X.
7. 4 years later,リア's salary increased by 40% to 1.3X + 40% of 1.3X = 1.3X + 0.52X = 1.82X.
8. Since Adrian's salary 4 years later is $72,800, we set 1.82X = $72,800 and solve for X:
   \[
   X = \frac{72800}{1.82} = 40,000
   \]
   This meansリア's initial salary 4 years ago was also $40,000.

mgsm-ja-122,"Question: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she had to finish her homework and slept 2 hours less each day than she slept on Monday. If she slept 1 hour more than those two days for the remaining three days of the week, how many hours did she sleep in total for that week?

Let's break it down step by step:
1. On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
3. On Wednesday, she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
4. For the remaining three days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), she slept 1 hour more than the 2-hour less days, which means she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total sleep for the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 5 hours
- Friday: 5 hours
- Saturday: 5 hours

Total sleep for the week = 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 33 hours

She stamps 3/1 of the letters that need stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the bundle that already have stamps, how many letters were in that bundle when Jen started her work?

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of letters in the bundle with already stamped letters.
2. According to the problem, 3/1 of the 60 letters that need stamps have already been stamped. So, \( \frac{3}{1} \times 60 = 180 \) letters would be stamped if all 60 needed stamps were stamped.
3. Since there are 30 letters already stamped, the remaining letters that need stamps are \( 60 - 30 = 30 \).
4. Therefore, the total number of letters that need stamps is \( 30 \) (already stamped) + \( 30 \) (to be stamped) = \( 60 \) letters.
5. Given that 3/1 of the 60 letters that need stamps are already stamped, and we know there are 30 letters already stamped, this confirms our total of 60 letters that need stamps.
6. Since the bundle with 30 letters already stamped is part of the 60 letters that need stamps, this bundle must have had 60 letters when Jen started her work.

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. Mark edits 1,000 words each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per word. How much money does Mark earn each week in cents?

Let's calculate the amount Mark earns from each publisher:
- Publisher A pays 5 cents per word, so for 1,000 words, Mark earns 5 * 1,000 = 5,000 cents from Publisher A.
- Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays 5 * 2 = 10 cents per word. For 1,000 words, Mark earns 10 * 1,000 = 10,000 cents from Publisher B.

Now, let's find the total amount Mark earns each week:
- Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
- Total earnings = 5,000 cents + 10,000 cents = 15,000 cents

Therefore, Mark earns $\\boxed{15000}$ cents each week.",15000,7500

To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total water he gets in the morning and the afternoon, and then sum these amounts.

- In the morning, he gets 5 buckets of water.
- Each bucket contains 5 liters of water.
- Therefore, the total water he gets in the morning is \( 5 \text{ buckets} \times 5 \text{ liters/bucket} = 25 \text{ liters} \).

- In the afternoon, he gets 6 buckets of water.
- Each bucket contains 5 liters of water.

To find the total distance Michael rode, we can break it down into two parts:

1. For the first 4 weeks, he rides 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week.
2. For the next 3 weeks, he rides 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Let's calculate the distance for each part:

There are 25 chocolate bars and 80 pieces of apple candy in Joe's Halloween candy bag. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a piece of apple candy. If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, what is the total weight of Joe's candy bag in grams?

Answer in English:
To find the total weight of Joe's candy bag, we first need to determine the weight of each piece of apple candy. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and is twice as heavy as a piece of apple candy, we can calculate the weight of one piece of apple candy as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of one piece of apple candy} = \frac{\text{Weight of one chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the apple candies:

\[ \text{Total weight of apple candies} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the apple candies to find the total weight of the candy bag:

\[ \text{Total weight of the candy bag} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's candy bag is $\boxed{2600}$.",2600,2600

Let's calculate the number of cakes bought each day:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 3 times the number of cakes bought on Monday = 3 * 4 = 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 5 times the number of cakes bought on Tuesday = 5 * 12 = 60 cakes

Let's denote the price of one cup as C and the price of one plate as P. According to the problem, a set of 20 cups costs $6000, so the price of one cup is C = $6000 / 20 = $300. 

A half set of plates would be 10 plates, so the total price for the plates would be 10P. Since the price of 20 cups is $1200 cheaper than the total price of the plates, we have:

\[ 10P = 6000 + 1200 \]
\[ 10P = 7200 \]
\[ P = 720 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost per cup:

\[ \text{Total cost per cup} = C + P = 300 + 720 = 1020 \]

She earns $5 each time she takes care of a child's needs, and her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. How many times does Sarah need to mow the lawn to be able to buy the jacket and shoes?

Let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
- Jacket: $30
- Shoes: $20 x 2 = $40
Total cost = $30 + $40 = $70

Now, let's calculate how much more money Sarah needs:
- Sarah already has $10 saved.
- The total cost is $70.
- Therefore, Sarah still needs $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah earns from mowing the lawn:
- Sarah earns $5 each time she takes care of a child's needs.
- Sarah earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
- Sarah needs to earn $60 more.

Let's assume Sarah earns $x from mowing the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $60.

Since we don't have the exact number of times she takes care of a child's needs, we'll focus on the lawn mowing part:
- Let \( y \) be the number of times Sarah mows the lawn.
- Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4.
- Therefore, \( 4y = 60 \).

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

So, Sarah needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn the remaining $60.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( w = r + 2 \) (Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens)
2. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \) (Jerry collects 42 eggs every day)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Let's solve it step by step:
1. Let the number of customers on the first day be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the number of customers on the second day is \( x + 50 \).
3. The total number of customers over three days is given as 500.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (x + 50) + \text{third day's customers} = 500 \]

Let the number of customers on the third day be \( y \). Then:
\[ x + x + 50 + y = 500 \]
\[ 2x + 50 + y = 500 \]
\[ 2x + y = 450 \]

We know from the problem that the number of customers on the first day is 100 (\( x = 100 \)):
\[ 2(100) + y = 450 \]
\[ 200 + y = 450 \]
\[ y = 450 - 200 \]

Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Currently, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water is currently in the small pool?

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as \( S \) gallons. Therefore, the amount of water in the large pool four minutes ago would be \( 2S \) gallons.

Since water leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in four minutes, the small pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons, and the large pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Thus, four minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 16 \) gallons, and the large pool had \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.

Currently, the small pool has \( S - 16 - 4 = S - 20 \) gallons, and the large pool has \( 2S - 16 + 4 \times 4 = 2S - 16 + 16 = 2S \) gallons.

According to the problem, the large pool currently has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ 2S = 4(S - 20) \]
\[ 2S = 4S - 80 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, four minutes ago, the small pool had 40 gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is:

- Fire-type cards remain unchanged: 30

Total number of cards now: 32 (Water) + 34 (Grass) + 30 (Fire) = 96

The probability of picking a Water-type card is the number of Water-type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Convert the fraction to a decimal:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \]

Rounding to four decimal places:
\[ 0.3333 \]

Therefore, the probability is:

He upgraded for an additional $3.00 and added potato chips and a drink. He has a $5.00 gift card to use. What is his total bill now?

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tamale with the additions:
- Basic tamale: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Two sauces: $0.25 + $0.25 = $0.50

Total cost of additions: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

Now, add the cost of the tamale and the additions:
- Total cost of tamale and additions: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00

Next, add the upgrade cost:
- Total cost with upgrade: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Then, add the cost of the potato chips and drink. Since the problem doesn't specify the cost of these items, we'll assume they are included in the $14.00 total:
- Total bill before using the gift card: $14.00

Finally, use the $5.00 gift card:
- Total bill after using the gift card: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad's total bill is $\\boxed{9.00}",0,9

mgsm-ja-229,"Translation: A watermelon farm cultivated 120 small watermelons. When Ashlyn visited the farm two months later, 30% of the watermelons were ripe and she took them home. Two weeks later, when she visited again, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe and she harvested them. How many watermelons were still not ripe when she harvested the last batch?

Let's calculate the number of ripe and unripe watermelons step by step:

1. Initially, the farm had 120 watermelons.
2. After the first visit, 30% of the watermelons were ripe. So, the number of ripe watermelons is \( 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \).
3. The number of unripe watermelons at this point is \( 120 - 36 = 84 \).
4. After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe. The remaining watermelons were 84. So, the number of ripe watermelons is \( 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \).
5. The number of unripe watermelons at this point is \( 84 - 63 = 21 \).

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were still not ripe when she harvested the last batch is 21.

To calculate the total amount Mark paid, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the taxes, and the registration fees.

1. Cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000
2. Taxes: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1,000/car = $12,000

Total amount paid = Cost of the cars + Taxes + Registration fees
Total amount paid = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling all his Lego sets:
   \[
   13 \text{ Lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Determine the total cost of the video games he buys:

polymath-low-ja-38,"Translation: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as long. What is his running speed?

To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total time he spends running in a week and the total distance he covers.

John runs 30 miles each of the other two days (since 60 miles / 2 days = 30 miles/day). So, the total distance covered in these two days is 30 miles/day * 2 days = 60 miles.

The first day, he runs 3 hours. So, the total time spent running in a week is 3 hours (first day) + 3 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 7.5 hours.

Now, we can calculate his running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Question: Dana can run at four times the speed she walks, but she can skip at half the speed she runs. If she skips at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many kilometers will she cover in 6 hours if she runs for one-third of the time and walks for the other two-thirds?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Given that Dana skips at 3 miles per hour and this is half her running speed, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance covered running:**
   - Dana runs for one-third of the 6-hour period, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Distance covered running in 2 hours: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Calculate the distance covered walking:**
   - Dana walks for two-thirds of the 6-hour period, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.
   - Distance covered walking in 4 hours: \( 3 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Calculate the total distance covered:**
   - Total distance covered: \( 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Convert the distance to kilometers:**
   - 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers.
   - Total distance in kilometers: \( 24 \text{ miles} \times 1.60934 \text{ km/mile} = 38.62416 \text{ kilometers} \).

Percy sat on the peak of Peakbo Mountain, and he blew fire into everything within a 1000-foot radius. Polly, the only weapon known for cutting the dragon, could throw a golden spear 400 feet. This distance is within the range of the dragon's flames. However, if Polly had a sapphire gem, she could throw the spear three times as far as she could without the gem. How much farther from the dragon's flames could Polly throw the golden spear if she had the sapphire gem?

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Without the sapphire gem, Polly can throw the spear 400 feet.
2. With the sapphire gem, Polly can throw the spear three times as far, which is \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, the maximum distance Polly can throw the spear without being hit by the flames is 1000 feet.

polymath-low-ja-53,"Question: A mechanic charges different rates for repairing tires on trucks and cars. The mechanic charges $60 for each tire repair on a truck and $40 for each tire repair on a car. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 tires in total but did not repair any truck tires. How much more profit did the mechanic make on the day with the higher profit?

Let's calculate the profit for each day:

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total profit: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60/tire = $0
- Total profit: $480

Now, we compare the profits:
- Thursday profit: $520
- Friday profit: $480

The difference in profit between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

polymath-low-ja-54,"Question: When the two sisters were driving home after bringing 7 kittens from their local shelter, their mother had told them that two of their cats at home had given birth to kittens. The first cat, Patch, gave birth to three times the number of kittens that were brought home, and the second cat, Trixie, gave birth to 12 kittens. How many kittens are there in the Dowfall family now?

Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, we know that 7 kittens were brought home from the shelter.
2. The first cat, Patch, gave birth to three times the number of kittens that were brought home. So, Patch gave birth to \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.
3. The second cat, Trixie, gave birth to 12 kittens.
4. The total number of kittens in the Dowfall family now is the sum of the kittens brought home and the kittens born at home: \(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\).

Therefore, the total number of kittens in the Dowfall family now is $\boxed{40}$.",40,40

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. How many boxes at most can be loaded onto the trucks without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Calculate the maximum weight the bridge can bear:
   \[
   \text{Bridge's weight limit} = 5000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Calculate the weight of one box:
   \[
   \text{Weight of one box} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Calculate the weight of 33 boxes:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 33 boxes} = 33 \times 15 = 495 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Add the weight of the driver and the empty truck:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight of driver and empty truck} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. Determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the bridge's weight limit:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of boxes.
   - The total weight of \( x \) boxes is \( 15x \) pounds.
   - The total weight including the driver and the truck is \( 15x + 3755 \) pounds.
   - Set up the inequality:

Since it was delivered through a delivery company, they added a 25% service charge to the final total, which included a delivery fee of $3.00. Steven also added a $4.00 tip. What was the final cost of Steven's grocery order after adding the extra charges?

Answer:
First, we calculate the service charge on the $40.00 bill:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, we add the delivery fee and the tip to the original bill:

polymath-low-ja-60,"Translation: There are 1 rotten orange, 20% that are still green, 2 that are sour, and the rest are in good condition in the basket. How many oranges are in good condition?

Let's denote the total number of oranges as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are still green.
- 2 oranges are sour.
- The rest are in good condition.

The number of good condition oranges can be expressed as \( x - 1 - 2 \) (since 1 orange is bad and 2 are sour).

Since 20% of the oranges are still green, this means that 80% of the oranges are in good condition. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.8x = x - 1 - 2 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 0.8x = x - 3 \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 0.8x - x = -3 \]
\[ -0.2x = -3 \]

Divide both sides by -0.2:
\[ x = \frac{-3}{-0.2} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the total number of oranges is 15. The number of good condition oranges is:
\[ 15 - 1 - 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of good condition oranges is \(\boxed{12}\).",12,17

polymath-low-ja-62,"Question: If Masha works for the same company for 40 years, she will receive a pension of $50,000 per year. Starting from 20 years later, she will be able to receive a pension with a 5% annual increase. What will her pension be worth per year when she retires after 30 years?

To solve this, we need to calculate the future value of the pension when Masha retires after 30 years, taking into account the 5% annual increase.

1. Masha will work for 30 years, which is 10 years less than the 40 years required to receive the initial $50,000 pension.
2. The pension will increase by 5% each year starting from the 20th year of her employment.

First, we need to calculate the pension amount at the 20th year:
- Initial pension at 40th year: $50,000
- Number of years to reach 20th year: 40 - 20 = 20 years
- The pension will be compounded annually at 5% for the remaining 10 years (from 20th year to 30th year).

The formula for the future value of a compound interest is:
\[ FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( FV \) is the future value,
- \( PV \) is the present value ($50,000),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (10).

Plugging in the values:
\[ FV = 50000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{10} \]
\[ FV = 50000 \times (1.05)^{10} \]
\[ FV = 50000 \times 1.62889 \]
\[ FV \approx 81444.50 \]

Therefore, when Masha retires after 30 years, her pension will be approximately $81,444.50.

She has driven 100 miles since her last full tank, and it took her 4 gallons to refill the tank. The owner's manual states that the tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sofia drive on one tank of gas?

Let's calculate the distance Sofia can drive on one tank of gas:
1. The tank can hold 12 gallons of gas.
2. She used 4 gallons to refill the tank.
3. Therefore, the remaining capacity of the tank is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.
4. She has driven 100 miles with 4 gallons.
5. To find the distance she can drive with 8 gallons, we set up a proportion:

First, we calculate the total cost including the interest:
- Each smartphone costs $150.
- There are 5 smartphones.
- The interest rate is 2% per unit.

Total cost without interest = 5 smartphones * $150 = $750

Interest on each smartphone = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3

Total interest for 5 smartphones = 5 * $3 = $15

Total cost including interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Now, we need to find out how much Sheila has to pay each month for 3 months:
- Total cost including interest = $765

Let's denote the size of the top level as \( S_1 \), the second level as \( S_2 \), the third level as \( S_3 \), and the bottom level as \( S_4 \).

Given:
- \( S_1 = 16 \) square feet
- Each level is half the size of the level below it, so \( S_2 = \frac{1}{2} S_1 \), \( S_3 = \frac{1}{2} S_2 \), and \( S_4 = \frac{1}{2} S_3 \).

For the remaining lifespan of the dog, she needs to give 2 cups of dog food every day. If a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cesira need for the first year?

To solve this, we break it down into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the first year.

For the first 180 days:
- Number of cups needed = 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining days of the first year (assuming a year is 365 days):
- Remaining days = 365 days - 180 days = 185 days
- Number of cups needed = 185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Total number of cups needed for the first year:
- Total cups = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

To find the better price, let's calculate the cost per flower for each package:
- For the $2.50 package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333.
- For the $1 package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50.

The cheaper option is the $1 package of 2 flowers, costing $0.50 per flower. To buy 18 flowers at this price, the total cost would be 18 * $0.50 = $9.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers using the $2.50 package of 3 flowers:
- He would need 6 packages of 3 flowers each to get 18 flowers.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Initially, Lamb bought 25 pens.
2. Each time he refills a pen, he uses ink from 5 empty pens to fill 1 pen.
3. Therefore, for every 6 pens (5 empty + 1 filled), he only uses 1 pen.

To find out the total number of pens he can use:

- First, we need to determine how many sets of 6 pens he can make from 25 pens.
- We divide 25 by 6: \( 25 \div 6 = 4 \) remainder \( 1 \).

This means he can make 4 full sets of 6 pens, using 4 pens, and have 1 pen left over.

- In each set of 6 pens, he uses 1 pen, so from 4 sets, he uses 4 pens.
- The 1 leftover pen is not enough to make another set of 6, so he uses it as is.

Therefore, the total number of pens he can use is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \).

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, there are 1,000 students in the auditorium.

2. 30% of the students exited through exit A:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \text{ students}
   \]
   So, the remaining students after exit A are:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700 \text{ students}
   \]

3. Then, 5/3 of the remaining students exited through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{5}{3} \times 700 = \frac{3500}{3} \approx 1166.67 \text{ students}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   1166 \text{ students}
   \]
   So, the remaining students after exit B are:
   \[
   700 - 1166 = 134 \text{ students}
   \]

4. The remaining students (134) exited through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is $\boxed{134}$.",134,280

James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. How many more candies does John have compared to James if John has 54 candies?

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Let Robert's candies be \( R \).
2. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has \( 2R \) candies.
3. We are given that John has 54 candies, so \( 2R = 54 \).
4. Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = 27 \). So Robert has 27 candies.
5. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has \( 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.
6. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has compared to James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies.
7. The difference is \( 54 - 33 = 21 \).

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

Each of his remaining pen pal partners sends him 2 letters every week, and he sends them back in the same way. Mike can write a letter in 6 minutes. How many hours per week does Mike spend writing letters?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pen pal partners Mike is still corresponding with:**
   - Total pen pal partners: 5
   - Partners Mike stopped corresponding with: 2
   - Remaining pen pal partners: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \)

2. **Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives and sends per week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week.
   - Number of pen pal partners: 3
   - Total letters received and sent per week: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) letters

3. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing letters per week:**
   - Time to write one letter: 6 minutes
   - Total time to write 6 letters: \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) minutes

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Kai took 5 fries.
2. Billy took twice as many as Kai, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
3. Jim took 3 fewer fries than Kai, so Jim took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
4. The total number of fries taken by Kai, Billy, and Jim is \(5 + 10 + 2 = 17\).

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:

The movie lasts for 5 weeks. After the movie is completed, the makeup artist gives a 10% discount to Jean because of the large payment. How much did Jean pay?

First, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:
- Each makeup session costs $250 * 6 hours = $1500.
- There are 4 makeup sessions per week, so the cost per week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.
- The movie lasts for 5 weeks, so the total cost before discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000.

Next, let's calculate the discount amount:
- The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is $30000 * 10% = $3000.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:
- The total cost after the discount is $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. If one cookie contains 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue get compared to her sister?

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday:
- On Monday, Sue ate the same number of cookies as her sister, which is 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Next, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate:
- Total cookies Sue ate = 5 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 31 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories Sue consumed:
- Calories Sue consumed = 31 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 6200 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate:
- Total cookies her sister ate = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories her sister consumed:
- Calories her sister consumed = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Finally, let's find out how many more calories Sue got compared to her sister:

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the final selling price of the house. The increase in value is 150% of the initial purchase price of $80,000.

150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

Therefore, the final selling price is the initial purchase price plus the increase in value:

Final selling price = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price + renovation cost) from the final selling price:

Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Profit = Final selling price - Total cost = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

polymath-low-ja-4,"Question: If Wendy has 20 chickens and feeds them 3 times a day, with 15 cups of feed given in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, how many cups of feed does Wendy need to give in the evening?

To find out how many cups of feed Wendy needs to give in the evening, we first calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since Wendy feeds her chickens 3 times a day and the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, we can determine the amount of feed given in the evening by subtracting the morning and afternoon feed from the total feed:

Total feed given in the evening = Total feed given in a day - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon
Total feed given in a day = 3 * 3 cups (since she feeds 3 times a day)
Total feed given in a day = 9 cups

Therefore, the amount of feed given in the evening is:
9 cups - 40 cups = -31 cups

However, this calculation seems incorrect as we cannot have a negative amount of feed. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total feed given in a day is 9 cups, and the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups. This discrepancy suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Given the problem constraints and the provided data, the correct interpretation should be that the total feed given in a day is 9 cups, and the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, which is not possible under normal circumstances. 

Revisiting the problem, if we assume the total feed given in a day is indeed 9 cups (as it's the only logical amount given the problem constraints), then the amount of feed given in the evening would be:

9 cups - 40 cups = -31 cups

Since this is not possible, the correct answer based on the given data and constraints is:

To find the total amount, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Cost per 12 donuts = $68
   - Number of 12 donuts = 36
   - Total cost for donuts = \( \frac{36}{12} \times 68 = 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars

Out of the vacuum cleaners she is selling, she sold one-third of the green house ones, two in the red house, and half of the remaining orange house ones. How many vacuum cleaners did she start with if she has five left after the sales?

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold one-third of the green house ones, so the number of green house vacuum cleaners sold is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
2. She sold two vacuum cleaners in the red house.
3. The remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house are \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \). She sold half of these, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).

After these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, the equation representing the remaining vacuum cleaners is:
\[ x - \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \left( \frac{2x}{3} + 1 \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

A merchant is trying to choose between two buying plans: one for 5,000 dollars worth of gems and another for 8,000 dollars worth of electrical products. According to the merchant's financial advisor's estimate, the price of gems will increase by 2.5% and the price of electrical products by 1.2% in the same month. To maximize profit for the end of the month, which buying plan should the merchant choose? What will be the profit?

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

1. **Gem Plan:**
   - Initial cost: $5,000
   - Expected increase: 2.5%
   - Expected price at the end of the month: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

   Profit from gems: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electrical Product Plan:**
   - Initial cost: $8,000
   - Expected increase: 1.2%
   - Expected price at the end of the month: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

polymath-low-ja-19,"Question: A hike of 12 miles is to be done. It takes 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles. At an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire journey, what speed (in miles per hour) must she walk the remaining distance?

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total distance of the hike**: 12 miles.
2. **Distance already covered**: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
3. **Remaining distance**: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we need to calculate the time taken for the entire hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:

4. **Time taken for the entire hike**: 
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Time already spent**:
   - First 4 miles: 1 hour
   - Next 2 miles: 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

6. **Time left for the remaining 6 miles**:
   \[
   \text{Time left} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

7. **Speed required for the remaining 6 miles**:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Time left}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

Question: Orange juice that is 2/3 water makes up 10 liters. When trying to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is 5/3 water, 1 liter of orange juice is accidentally spilled. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the amount of water and juice in the 10 liters of orange juice:
   - Water in orange juice: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters
   - Juice in orange juice: \( 10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \) liters

2. Calculate the amount of water and juice in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
   - Water in pineapple drink: \( \frac{5}{3} \times 15 = 25 \) liters
   - Juice in pineapple drink: \( 15 - 25 = -10 \) liters (This indicates there is more water than juice, which is not possible in a drink. Let's correct this: the correct calculation should be 15 - (5/3 * 15) = 15 - 25 = -10, which means there's no juice left, just water. So, the pineapple drink is 25 liters of water.)

3. After spilling 1 liter of orange juice:
   - Remaining orange juice: \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters
   - Remaining water from orange juice: \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{19}{3} \) liters

4. Total water in the mixture:
   - Water from orange juice: \( \frac{19}{3} \) liters
   - Water from pineapple drink: 25 liters
   - Total water: \( \frac{19}{3} + 25 = \frac{19}{3} + \frac{75}{3} = \frac{94}{3} \) liters

5. Total volume of the mixture:
   - Total volume: 9 liters (orange juice) + 25 liters (pineapple drink) = 34 liters

6. Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:
   - Since the total mixture is 34 liters and 10 liters of orange juice were initially, the remaining 24 liters are from the pineapple drink.
   - Water in the remaining 24 liters: \( \frac{94}{3} \times \frac{24}{34} = \frac{94}{3} \times \frac{12}{17} = \frac{1128}{51} = \frac{376}{17} \approx 22.12 \) liters

polymath-low-ja-21,"Translation: Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31 years old, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond had a son at 23, we can calculate his current age by adding 23 to Samantha's current age.

Samantha's current age = 31 years
Raymond's age when he had a son = 23 years
Therefore, Raymond's current age = 31 + 23 = 54 years

Now, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond was 23 to have a son. This is calculated by subtracting Raymond's age when he had a son from his current age.

Years ago Raymond had a son = Raymond's current age - Raymond's age when he had a son
Years ago Raymond had a son = 54 - 23 = 31 years

So, Raymond's son was born 31 years ago.

How long, in minutes, will the winner have to wait for the loser to finish the race?

First, convert all distances to feet for easier calculation:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet

Next, convert the time each person takes to travel their distance:
- Time for Steve: 1 minute and 440 feet = 1 + 440/5280 minutes = 1 + 1/12 minutes = 12/12 + 1/12 = 13/12 minutes
- Time for Tim: 1 minute and 264 feet = 1 + 264/5280 minutes = 1 + 1/20 minutes = 20/20 + 1/20 = 21/20 minutes

Now, calculate the time each person takes to travel their distance:

mgsm-ja-153,"Question in English: Dave bought a large bag of fried potatoes and before the hungry seagull could snatch it from his hand, he ate 14 of them. Before the seagull could get to the ground and eat half of the remaining potatoes, 3 pigeons each stole 3 potatoes from Dave. Then, a raccoon stole a third of the remaining potatoes. Afterward, an ant carried away the last 5 potatoes. How many potatoes were originally in the bag when Dave bought them?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of potatoes originally in the bag.

2. Dave ate 14 potatoes, so the remaining potatoes are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of the remaining potatoes, so the seagull ate \( \frac{x - 14}{2} \) potatoes, and the remaining potatoes are \( \frac{x - 14}{2} \).

4. The 3 pigeons each stole 3 potatoes, so the pigeons stole a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) potatoes. The remaining potatoes are \( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \).

5. The raccoon stole a third of the remaining potatoes, so the raccoon stole \( \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) \) potatoes, and the remaining potatoes are \( \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) \).

6. The ant carried away the last 5 potatoes, so the remaining potatoes are 5. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) = 5
   \]

7. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 = \frac{15}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x - 14}{2} = \frac{15}{2} + 9
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x - 14}{2} = \frac{15 + 18}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x - 14}{2} = \frac{33}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x - 14 = 33
   \]
   \[
   x = 47
   \]

Thus, the number of potatoes originally in the bag when Dave bought them is $\\boxed{47}$.",47,48

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, student Kimo attends 1 hour of 3 lectures each day. On Tuesday and Thursday, he attends 2 hours of lectures twice each day. For an entire semester, school lasts for 16 weeks. How many hours does Kimo spend attending lectures in one semester?

Answer:
To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending lectures in one semester, we need to break down the hours for each day and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kimo attends 1 hour of lectures each day. So, for 3 days, he attends 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Kimo attends 2 hours of lectures twice each day. So, for 2 days, he attends 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- Therefore, in one day, Kimo attends 3 + 4 = 7 hours of lectures.

Since school lasts for 16 weeks, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending lectures in one semester is 7 hours/day * 16 days/week = 112 hours.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending lectures in one semester is \\boxed{112}.",112,272
mgsm-ja-155,"Translation: Bill makes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. How many feet will the total length be if all of Bill's baked goods are laid out end to end?

First, let's convert all lengths to the same unit. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the length of each baguette in inches is 2 * 12 = 24 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:
- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Next, we sum these lengths to get the total length in inches:
1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods laid out end to end is $\boxed{280}$.",280,280
mgsm-ja-156,"Question in English: The zoo keeper feeds all the monkeys at the zoo. He orders all the bananas from his local farm every two months. If each monkey needs 200 bananas and each gorilla needs 400 bananas, and each pig needs 100 bananas per month, how many bananas does he need to order for two months?

Let's calculate the number of bananas needed for two months:

- Number of monkeys: 200
- Number of gorillas: 400
- Number of pigs: 100

Each monkey needs 200 bananas per month, so in two months, each monkey needs \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.
Each gorilla needs 400 bananas per month, so in two months, each gorilla needs \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.
Each pig needs 100 bananas per month, so in two months, each pig needs \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now we calculate the total for each type of animal:
- Total bananas for monkeys: \(200 \text{ monkeys} \times 400 \text{ bananas/monkey} = 80,000 \text{ bananas}\)
- Total bananas for gorillas: \(400 \text{ gorillas} \times 800 \text{ bananas/gorilla} = 320,000 \text{ bananas}\)
- Total bananas for pigs: \(100 \text{ pigs} \times 200 \text{ bananas/pig} = 20,000 \text{ bananas}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of bananas needed:
\[ 80,000 + 320,000 + 20,000 = 420,000 \]

Therefore, the zoo keeper needs to order $\boxed{420000}$ bananas for two months.",420000,1400
mgsm-ja-157,"Question: Break and Kerry are competing to see who can run farther in 15 minutes. They have decided to run on a 100-yard football field. Break runs back and forth 15 times, while Kerry runs from the 40-yard line to the 100-yard line and back, a total of 34 times. How much farther did the winner run compared to the loser?

To solve this, we first calculate the distance each person ran.

For Break:
- Each round is 100 yards (to the end and back).
- Running 15 rounds means: \(15 \times 100 = 1500\) yards.

For Kerry:
- Each round is from 40 yards to 100 yards and back.
- The distance for one round is \(100 - 40 + 40 = 100\) yards.
- Running 34 rounds means: \(34 \times 100 = 3400\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Break ran 1500 yards.
- Kerry ran 3400 yards.

The difference in distance is:
- \(3400 - 1500 = 1900\) yards.

Therefore, the winner ran 1900 yards farther than the loser.

The final answer is $\boxed{1900}$.",1900,80

- Cost of pens: 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6
- Cost of notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8
- Cost of bond paper: $20

Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper

To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday:
   - Depth on Monday = 17 feet
   - Increase on Tuesday = 7 feet
   - Depth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday:

To solve this, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by each person:
- Anakin caught 10 crabs, 6 sea urchins, and 3 snappers.
- Rokkin caught 5 fewer crabs than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) crabs.
- Rokkin caught 3 fewer sea urchins than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea urchins.
- Rokkin caught 2 more snappers than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) snappers.

Now, let's sum up the total number of each type of fish caught:
- Total crabs: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea urchins: \(6 + 3 = 9\)

mgsm-ja-162,"Translation: The price of one bee ball is $20, and it increases by 20% every two months. How much will one bee ball cost after 36 months?

To calculate the price after 36 months, we can use the formula for compound interest, where the initial amount is $20, the rate of increase is 20% (or 0.20), and the time is 36 months (which is 18 intervals of 2 months each).

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ A = P \times (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n intervals, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the rate of increase per interval.
- \( n \) is the number of intervals the money is invested or borrowed for.

Plugging in the values:
\[ P = 20 \]
\[ r = 0.20 \]
\[ n = 18 \]

\[ A = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ A = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 12.30 \]

Therefore:
\[ A = 20 \times 12.30 \]
\[ A = 246 \]

If Sandra has a job of making 15 Spanish Omelets for the school's fundraising activity, how many times does Sandra need to take care of the children?

To solve this, we need to determine how many baskets of eggs Sandra needs to collect for 15 Spanish Omelets. Since each basket contains 9 eggs and each omelet requires 3 eggs, we can calculate the number of baskets needed as follows:

1. Calculate the number of baskets needed for 15 omelets:
\[ \text{Number of baskets} = \frac{15 \text{ omelets}}{3 \text{ eggs/omelet}} = 5 \text{ baskets} \]

2. Since each basket contains 9 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ \text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ baskets} \times 9 \text{ eggs/basket} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

3. Given that each time Sandra takes care of the children, she receives a basket of 9 eggs, we can find out how many times she needs to take care of the children:
\[ \text{Number of times} = \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/time}} = 5 \text{ times} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to take care of the children 5 times.

Sandra, the florist at the Flower Corner, was very annoyed by the undelivered orders from Fred. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, and she had ordered 200 pink Dutch lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. If Sandra threatened to switch suppliers if Fred couldn't deliver the red roses by 5 PM, how many red roses must Fred prepare by 5 PM to keep Sandra as a supplier?

Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

Given:
- Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses \( R = 4W \).
- Sandra ordered 200 pink Dutch lilies, and this is 5 times the number of white carnations, so \( 5W = 200 \).

First, we find the number of white carnations \( W \):
\[ 5W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of red roses \( R \):
\[ R = 4W \]
\[ R = 4 \times 40 \]
\[ R = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must prepare 160 red roses by 5 PM to keep Sandra as a supplier.

mgsm-ja-182,"Question translated to English: Jane is 2 years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years younger than half of Jane's age. If Jane is 30 years old, how old is Jane?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. If Jane is 30 years old, then two years ago she was 28 years old.
2. Let's denote Jane's current age as J and Mark's current age as M. According to the problem, J = M + 2.
3. Two years ago, Jane was 28 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years younger than half of Jane's age. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 28 / 2 - 5 = 14 - 5 = 9 years old.
4. Since two years ago Mark was 9 years old, his current age M is 9 + 2 = 11.
5. Given that Jane is 2 years older than Mark, Jane's current age J is 11 + 2 = 13.

Therefore, Jane is 13 years old.

mgsm-ja-183,"Question: Given that two track and field teams are competing in a 1600-meter relay race. Each team has four members who each run 400 meters, which is equivalent to one lap on a standard track. One team has equal abilities, with each member completing 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team has varying abilities, with the first runner completing the 400 meters in 60 seconds and each subsequent runner completing 400 meters 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. How much of a time difference, in seconds, will the winning team have over the losing team?

To find the winning team's time difference, let's calculate the total time for each team.

For the first team (equal abilities):
- Each runner completes 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Total time for the team = 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

For the second team (varying abilities):
- The first runner completes 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner completes 400 meters in 57 seconds (60 - 3).
- The third runner completes 400 meters in 54 seconds (57 - 3).
- The fourth runner completes 400 meters in 51 seconds (54 - 3).
- Total time for the team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The winning team is the first team with a total time of 220 seconds, and the losing team is the second team with a total time of 222 seconds.

The time difference between the winning team and the losing team is:
222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

Therefore, the winning team will win by 2 seconds.

mgsm-ja-184,"Translation: Jerry is rolling a 6-sided die. By how much is the probability that he rolls a number greater than 3 higher than the probability that he rolls two consecutive even numbers?

To solve this, we need to calculate the probabilities for each event.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - Possible outcomes: 4, 5, 6
   - Total number of outcomes: 6
   - Probability = $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$

2. **Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers:**
   - Possible outcomes for even numbers: 2, 4, 6
   - Probability of rolling an even number on the first roll: $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$
   - Probability of rolling an even number on the second roll: $\frac{1}{2}$ (since only 2, 4, 6 remain)
   - Combined probability = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$

Now, we find the difference in probabilities:
- Difference = Probability of greater than 3 - Probability of two consecutive even numbers
- Difference = $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$
- Convert the difference to a percentage: $\frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%$

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% higher than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers.

The final answer is $\boxed{25}$.",25,25

To calculate the total amount Mandi should pay back after 3 months, we need to consider the interest accrued over that period.

The formula to calculate the future value (FV) of a principal amount (P) with compound interest (r) over a period of time (t) is:
\[ FV = P \times (1 + r)^t \]

Here, P = $100, r = 2% = 0.02, and t = 3 months.

When the second alarm rang, it rang for 3 times as long as the first one. When the third alarm rang, it rang for half as long as the second one. How many times did the alarm ring in total?

Let's break down the information:
1. The first alarm rang 4 times.
2. The second alarm rang for 3 times the duration of the first alarm.
3. The third alarm rang for half the duration of the second alarm.

Let's denote the duration of the first alarm as D. Then:
- The second alarm duration = 3D
- The third alarm duration = 1.5D

The total number of rings is the sum of the rings from each alarm:
- First alarm: 4 rings
- Second alarm: 3D rings
- Third alarm: 1.5D rings

Since D is the duration of the first alarm, we can calculate the total number of rings as:
\[ 4 + 3D + 1.5D = 4 + 4.5D \]

We need to find the value of D. Since the problem doesn't provide a specific duration, we can assume D is a unit of time that fits the conditions given. Given the conditions, we can infer that D = 1 unit of time.

Therefore:
\[ 4 + 4.5 \times 1 = 4 + 4.5 = 8.5 \]

Since the number of rings must be a whole number, and considering the conditions, the total number of rings is:
\[ \boxed{8.5} \]

To find out how long Gerald will take to run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his diet, we first need to determine Gerald's original speed and then calculate his new speed after the diet change.

1. Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is 50 seconds.
2. Lee's time to run the 400-meter hurdles is 38 seconds.
3. Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald's original speed is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{50 \text{ seconds}} = 8 \text{ meters/second}
   \]
4. After improving his diet, Gerald's speed improves by 10%, so his new speed is:
   \[
   \text{New speed} = 8 \text{ meters/second} \times 1.10 = 8.8 \text{ meters/second}

polymath-low-ja-97,"Question: When Frida makes sauce with canned tomatoes, the volume is halved. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. The last batch of tomato sauce contained 32 ounces. How many tomatoes did Frida use?

To solve this, we need to determine the number of tomatoes used in the last batch of sauce. 

First, we know that the volume of the sauce is halved each time the recipe is scaled. The last batch of sauce is 32 ounces, which means the original recipe (before halving) was 64 ounces (since 32 ounces is half of 64 ounces).

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we can calculate the number of tomatoes used in the original recipe of 64 ounces. 

The number of 16-ounce cans in 64 ounces is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Frida used 12 tomatoes.

The first friend rings the bell 20 times before Jerome opens the door, and the second friend rings the bell 1/4 as many times as the first friend. The third friend rings the bell 10 more times than the second friend. If the fourth friend rings the bell 60 times, how many times was the bell rung in total?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. The first friend rings the bell 20 times.
2. The second friend rings the bell 1/4 of the first friend's times:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ times}
   \]
3. The third friend rings the bell 10 more times than the second friend:
   \[
   5 + 10 = 15 \text{ times}
   \]
4. The fourth friend rings the bell 60 times.

Now, we add up all the times the bell was rung:
\[
20 + 5 + 15 + 60 = 100

polymath-low-ja-102,"Question: John likes to drink one cup of water at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Ultimately, he drinks one cup more before going to bed. John does this every day during weekdays but on weekends, he wants to relax and drinks soda instead of water at dinner. How many times more water does he drink per week compared to soda?

Let's calculate:
- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 5 days * 1 cup/day = 5 cups of water
- Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): 2 days * 1 cup/day = 2 cups of water
- Total water consumption per week: 5 + 2 = 7 cups of water
- Soda consumption per week: 1 cup/day * 2 days = 2 cups of soda

Now, we calculate the ratio:
\[ \text{Ratio of water to soda} = \frac{7 \text{ cups of water}}{2 \text{ cups of soda}} = 3.5 \]

Therefore, John drinks $\\boxed{3.5}$ times more water than soda per week.",5,26

The fog barrier that flows from the sea covers the town. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the town. If the town is 42 miles from the seaside to the opposite land's edge, how many minutes will it take for fog to cover the entire town?

Answer:
To solve this, we first calculate the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles:
$$ \frac{42}{3} = 14 \text{ segments} $$

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time to cover 42 miles will be:
$$ 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes} $$

Therefore, the time it takes for the entire town to be covered in fog is $\boxed{140}$.",140,140

polymath-low-ja-107,"Question in English: 
Frankly watches TV after finishing his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched one hour episodes of his favorite shows. On Wednesday, he watched several 30-minute episodes. On Thursday, he watched an hour episode and 30-minute episode after finishing his homework early. On Friday during the weekend, he stayed up late and watched two one-hour episodes. If he watched TV for a total of 7 hours, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Let's calculate the total time Frankly spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:

- Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours each (2 * 1 hour)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours (2 * 1 hour)
- Wednesday: x hours (unknown)

Total time spent watching TV: 7 hours

So, the equation to solve is:
\[ 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 + x = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 7.5 + x = 7 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 7 - 7.5 \]
\[ x = -0.5 \]

Since the negative value indicates an error in the setup or interpretation, let's re-evaluate the given information and constraints. The only possible scenario is that the total time Frankly watched TV is indeed 7 hours, and the breakdown should be checked again.

Given the breakdown:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours each (2 * 1 hour)
- Thursday: 1.5 hours (1 hour + 30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours (2 * 1 hour)
- Wednesday: \( x \) hours (unknown)

Revising the equation:
\[ 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 + x = 7 \]
\[ 7.5 + x = 7 \]
\[ x = 7 - 7.5 \]
\[ x = -0.5 \]

This negative value indicates an inconsistency. Rechecking the problem constraints, the only feasible solution is that Frankly watched 0 hours on Wednesday, meaning he did not watch any 30-minute episodes.

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankly watched on Wednesday is:

polymath-low-ja-108,"Question in English: Henry is making cookies for a local contest. He wants to bake twice as many as last year. After baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more than he thought. While taking them out to cool, he removes 5 cookies, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry thought he would bake as \( x \).
2. According to the problem, he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
3. After removing 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so before removing the 5 cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.
4. Therefore, \( 2x + 15 = 115 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[
2x + 15 = 115
\]
\[
2x = 115 - 15

Unfortunately, someone made a mistake, and Berthe's piece was 24 rolls long and 2 rolls wide, while Marcel's piece was 14 rolls long and 3 rolls wide. On average, how much did they eat in total?

To solve this, we need to calculate the area of each piece of fruit roll and then find the average.

Berthe's piece area = 24 rolls * 2 rolls = 48 square rolls
Marcel's piece area = 14 rolls * 3 rolls = 42 square rolls

Total area of fruit rolls = 48 + 42 = 90 square rolls

Total number of fruit rolls eaten = 24 + 14 = 38 rolls

Let's break down the problem:

1. Julia needs to paddle 64 feet to reach the shore.
2. The boat takes 10 feet to accumulate 2 liters of water.

To find out the total amount of water that entered the boat, we can divide the total distance by the distance per 2 liters of water:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 64 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance per 2 liters} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 6.4 \]

Since each 10 feet segment accumulates 2 liters of water, we multiply the number of segments by 2 liters:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6.4 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that entered the boat is 12.8 liters.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let Rea's current salary be \( R \).
2. Adrian's current salary is 30% higher than Rea's, so Adrian's current salary is \( 1.3R \).
3. Four years ago, Adrian's salary was \( 1.3R \) and it increased by 40% to \( 1.3R \times 1.4 = 1.82R \).
4. Given that Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.3R = 40000
   \]
   Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
