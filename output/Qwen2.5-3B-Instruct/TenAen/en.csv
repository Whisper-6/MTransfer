mgsm-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of blue ties John bought:**
   John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of each red tie:**
   Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**
   John bought 10 red ties, each costing $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on ties:**
   Add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties.
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
   \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[

mgsm-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back from his destination, we need to know the distance he traveled to his destination first. However, the problem does not specify the distance. Let's assume the distance from his starting point to the destination is \(d\) miles.

1. **Calculate the time taken to travel to the destination:**
   - Tom's speed to the destination is 10 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to travel \(d\) miles at 10 mph is given by:
     \[
     \text{Time to destination} = \frac{d}{10} \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to travel back:**
   - Tom's speed on the return trip is 6 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to travel back \(d\) miles at 6 mph is given by:
     \[
     \text{Time to return} = \frac{d}{6} \text{ hours}
     \]

Since the problem does not provide the specific distance \(d\), we cannot determine the exact numerical value for the time taken to return. However, if we assume the distance \(d\) is known, the formula for the time taken to return is \(\frac{d}{6}\) hours.

If we need to provide a general answer based on the given speeds and without the specific distance, we can express the time taken to return as:
\[
\boxed{\frac{d}{6}}
\]

If we assume a specific distance, for example, \(d = 10\) miles, then:
\[
\text{Time to return} = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours}

mgsm-en-75,"To determine the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to find the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. Level 4 (top level):
   \[
   \text{Level 4} = 16
   \]

2. Level 3 (below level 4):
   \[
   \text{Level 3} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

3. Level 2 (below level 3):
   \[
   \text{Level 2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

4. Level 1 (below level 2):
   \[
   \text{Level 1} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we have the square footages for all levels:
- Level 1: 2
- Level 2: 4
- Level 3: 8
- Level 4: 16

Next, we calculate the average square footage of a level by summing these values and dividing by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Sum of square footages} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30
\]

\[
\text{Number of levels} = 4
\]

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60
mgsm-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first 180 days, we start by calculating the amount of dog food needed for that period. The puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. Therefore, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is:

\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups of dog food are left for the rest of the puppy's life. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we subtract the amount used in the first 180 days from the total amount in one bag:

\[ 110 \text{ cups} - 180 \text{ cups} = -70 \text{ cups} \]

Since the puppy needs more than 110 cups of dog food in the first 180 days, it is clear that the puppy will need more than one bag of dog food for the rest of its life. However, we are only asked for the amount used in the first 180 days. Thus, the number of bags used in the first 180 days is:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since we are asked to provide the number of bags used in the first 180 days, and typically we would round up to the next whole number if we are dealing with whole bags, but here we are only asked for the number of bags used, we can express it as a fraction or a decimal. However, the problem asks for a whole number, so we consider the integer part of the division:

1. First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}

3. Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Finally, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is:

2. Calculate the combined weight of Grace and Alex.

First, we know that Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex's weight is described as 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express Alex's weight mathematically as:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \]

Now, we need to find the combined weight of Grace and Alex:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]

First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. The increase in value is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:

3. Subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed required for the entire flock for the day.

First, let's find out how much feed the entire flock receives in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
- Therefore, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

mgsm-en-6,"To determine the total number of sheep owned by Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships.

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep Seattle has.
   Given that \( S = 20 \).

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Therefore, the number of sheep Charleston has, \( C \), is:
   \[
   C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Therefore, the number of sheep Toulouse has, \( T \), is:
   \[
   T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Next, we sum the number of sheep from all three cities to find the total number of sheep:
\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
20 + 80 = 100
\]
\[
100 + 160 = 260
\]

Thus, the total number of sheep is:

1. **Calculate the time to download the first 80 GB:**
   Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute. Therefore, the time to download the first 80 GB is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Account for the restart and the time to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   After downloading 80 GB, a restart takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining file size is 120 GB. The time to download the remaining 120 GB is:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Adding the 20 minutes of restart time, the total time for the restart and the download of the remaining 120 GB is:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total download time:**
   The total time to download the file is the sum of the time to download the first 80 GB, the restart time, and the time to download the remaining 120 GB:
   \[
   40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\).",120,160
mgsm-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered in this segment: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered in this segment: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered in this segment: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\) at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Distance covered in this segment: \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we sum the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles}\]

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:

Next, we calculate her earnings from the regular hours:
- Regular hourly rate: $10
- Earnings from regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Then, we calculate her earnings from the overtime hours:
- Overtime hourly rate: 1.2 times the regular hourly rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12/hour
- Earnings from overtime hours: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Finally, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
- Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

mgsm-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from his lemon tree, we need to compare the total costs and total earnings over time.

First, let's calculate the annual cost and revenue:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

The net annual profit (or loss) is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
\[ \text{Net annual profit} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost of $90. We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the total net profit after \( n \) years is at least $90. The total net profit after \( n \) years is given by:
\[ \text{Total net profit after } n \text{ years} = 7.5n \]

We need to solve the inequality:
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]

Dividing both sides by 7.5, we get:
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take \( n = 12 \) years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is:

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

mgsm-en-15,"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates and then compare the profit from each plan.

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Current value of jewelry: $5,000
- Market growth rate for jewelry: 2.5% or 0.025
- Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
\[ \text{Future value of jewelry} = 5000 + (5000 \times 0.025) = 5000 + 125 = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- Current value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Market growth rate for electronic gadgets: 1.2% or 0.012
- Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
\[ \text{Future value of electronic gadgets} = 8000 + (8000 \times 0.012) = 8000 + 96 = 8096 \]

Now, we need to determine the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
\[ \text{Profit from jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
\[ \text{Profit from electronic gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits, we see that the profit from purchasing the jewelry is $125, which is greater than the profit from purchasing the electronic gadgets, which is $96.

Therefore, the merchant should choose to purchase the jewelry to maximize profit. The profit from this choice is $125.

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking.
2. Determine the total distance she still needs to hike.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to hike the remaining distance.
4. Determine the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent so far is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]
We need to find the total distance and total time. The total distance is 12 miles. Let \(t\) be the time she has left to hike the remaining distance. The total time will be \(2 + t\) hours. We want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so:
\[
4 = \frac{12}{2 + t}

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.**

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink after spilling one liter.**

Since we spill one liter of the orange drink, the remaining amount of orange drink is:

Next, we calculate the cost of the 5 packs of milk:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 packs of milk} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 4 apples} = 4 \times \$1.50 = \$6 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Each box of pizza costs \( \$8.50 \), so the total cost of the pizza boxes is:

mgsm-en-28,"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip.
2. Determine the distance of the first stop.
3. Determine the distance of the second stop.
4. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops.

The total distance of Henry's trip is 60 miles. His first stop was after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance traveled before his first stop is 20 miles. This means the distance remaining after the first stop is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ miles} \]

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, the distance to the second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]
However, we need to note that he has already traveled 20 miles before his first stop, so the distance from the end of the first stop to the second stop is:
\[ 60 - 20 - 15 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance traveled between his first and second stops is the distance from the end of the first stop to the second stop, which is 25 miles.

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25

mgsm-en-30,"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a common variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is:

\[7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\]

Allen's age is:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Next, we need to determine Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109

1. Identify the guesses made by Gunter's friends.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's denote the first guess as \( G_1 \). According to the problem, \( G_1 = 80 \).

Next, the second guess \( G_2 \) is 20 more than half of the first guess. Therefore,
\[ G_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60. \]

The third guess \( G_3 \) is 25% more than the first guess. Therefore,
\[ G_3 = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100. \]

Now, we need to find the average of these three guesses. The average \( A \) is given by the formula:
\[ A = \frac{G_1 + G_2 + G_3}{3} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80. \]

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \( \boxed{70} \).",70,70

2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet or exceed this total.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

First, we calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are required to get at least 60 yogurts. Since each set contains 4 yogurts, we divide 60 by 4:
\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \]
This means Terry needs 15 sets of 4 yogurts to get at least 60 yogurts. Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost is:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his Lego sets.
2. Calculate the total amount of money John spends on video games.
3. Determine the total amount of money John has after selling his Lego sets and buying the video games.
4. Use the information about the leftover money to find out how much money John had initially.
5. Subtract the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he originally had.

Let's start with the first step:

1. John sells 13 Lego sets at $15 each.
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   \[
   \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. John has $5 left after these transactions.
   \[
   \text{Total money John has left} = 195 - 160 + 5 = 39 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The total money John had initially is the money he had left plus the money he spent on video games:
   \[
   \text{Initial money} = 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since he has $5 left after the transactions, the initial money is:
   \[
   \text{Initial money} = 195 - 160 + 5 = 39 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   This confirms our initial calculation.

5. John originally had 13 Lego sets and he sold all of them. Therefore, he still has:

The number of Lego sets John still has is \(\boxed{0}\).",0,2
mgsm-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total running time for the week.
2. Determine the total distance run in those hours.
3. Calculate the average speed based on the total distance and total time.

First, we know John runs 3 days a week and the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

The total running time for the week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance run in those 6 hours is 60 miles. To find the average speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10
mgsm-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her time spent running and walking, and then calculate the distance she covers during each activity.

First, let's find out how fast Dana can walk. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} \]
Since the problem does not specify her walking speed, we assume it is the same as her skipping speed (3 miles per hour) for the purpose of this calculation:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances from running and walking, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Dana can travel in six hours is:

3. Determine how far outside the dragon's reach this distance is.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so the distance outside the dragon's reach that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:

1. Calculate the total number of calories you have left to consume.
2. Determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the servings into grams.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories left to consume.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories left} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.**

Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can eat with 200 calories left, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving.
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 3: Convert the servings into grams.**

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, each serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]
Therefore, 0.8 servings is:

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's find out how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

The cost of the beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Additionally, the cost of the wicks is $10.00, so the total cost of making the candles is:

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

mgsm-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, the total number of cars initially on the motorway was 30. After 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam, and 5 cars took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars remaining on the motorway after these events can be expressed as:

\[ 30 - x - 20 + 5 \]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

\[ 15 - x \]

Since the number of cars remaining on the motorway must be a non-negative integer, we have:

\[ 15 - x \geq 0 \]

This implies:

\[ x \leq 15 \]

Additionally, since \( x \) represents the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, it must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, \( x \) can take any integer value from 0 to 15. To find the specific value of \( x \), we need to ensure that the remaining cars on the motorway after the jam is over is a non-negative integer. The simplest and most straightforward solution is to check if \( x = 10 \) satisfies the conditions:

If \( x = 10 \):

- Initially, there were 30 cars.

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Determine the number of potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number she currently has.

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we calculate the number of potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number she currently has:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{Rings by the first friend} = 20
   \]

2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. First, we calculate 1/4 of the first friend's rings:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   Adding this to the first friend's rings gives:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25

mgsm-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate John's water consumption during the weekdays:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).
- He also drinks 1 glass of water before bed.
- Therefore, he drinks 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 glasses of water per day on a weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate John's water consumption during the weekends:
- On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- He does not drink water before bed on weekends.
- Therefore, he drinks 1 glass of water per day on a weekend.
- There are 2 days in the weekend.

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the water consumption from the weekdays and the weekends to find the total weekly consumption:

\]

This means the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. So, the number of pieces placed by her mom is:

\[
\text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
\]

After her mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

mgsm-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we will first calculate the total number of hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then find out how many hours he watched on Wednesday.

Here is the breakdown of the TV watching hours for each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: Let the number of 30-minute episodes be \( x \). Therefore, the total time watched on Wednesday is \( x \times 0.5 \) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour (1-hour episode) + 0.5 hours (30-minute episode) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours (two 1-hour episodes)

The total time watched from Monday to Friday is the sum of the hours watched each day. According to the problem, the total time watched is 7 hours. So we can write the equation as:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7 \]
\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 5.5 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 0.5x = 7 - 5.5 \]
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is \(\boxed{3}\).",3,3

2. Determine the total distance Julia rows.
3. Calculate the total amount of water the boat takes on during the rowing.

**Step 1: Calculate the speed at which Julia rows.**

Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}

\[ 40000 = L \times 1.30 \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. We know that four years later, Adrien's salary was 40 percent more than what he was making four years ago. Therefore, his salary four years later is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \]

Now, we find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

3. Calculate the total cost for the watermelons.
4. Calculate the total cost for the peppers.
5. Calculate the total cost for the oranges.
6. Sum up all the costs to get the final amount.

Let's start with the cost of each pepper. According to the problem, each pepper costs $15.

Next, we calculate the cost of each watermelon. The problem states that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Therefore, the cost of each watermelon is:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of each orange. The problem states that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. Therefore, the cost of each orange is:
\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the watermelons. Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, so the total cost for the watermelons is:
\[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for the peppers. Dillon is buying 20 peppers, so the total cost for the peppers is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for the oranges. Dillon is buying 10 oranges, so the total cost for the oranges is:
\[ 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up all the costs to get the final amount:
\[ 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:

1. **Calculate the number of patient visits per day:**
   \[
   \text{Number of visits per day} = 500
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from the patients:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of hours each patient is seen is:
     \[
     \text{Number of hours per patient} = \frac{24 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
   - Thus, the revenue per patient is:
     \[
     \text{Revenue per patient} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total revenue from all patients is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 80 \text{ dollars/patient} = 40000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost to the hospital:**
   - Each doctor charges $150 per hour to the hospital.
   - The number of hours each doctor works per day is 0.4 hours.
   - Therefore, the cost per patient is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per patient} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

mgsm-en-199,"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
2. Calculate the payment from each publisher.
3. Sum the payments to find the total amount Mark makes in a week.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits:
\[
\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A}
\]
\[
\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B}
\]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[
500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
\]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
\[
2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
\]
Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[
500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
\]

Adding the payments from both publishers gives the total amount Mark makes in a week:
\[
2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
\]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is \(\boxed{7500}\).",7500,7500

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the required total sum of all six test scores to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score needed on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the required total sum.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]
So, for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores is the sum of the first five test scores plus the sixth test score:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The final answer is:

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, let's find the weight of each candied apple:
\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = \text{Number of chocolate bars} \times \text{Weight of each chocolate bar} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams}
\]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = \text{Number of candied apples} \times \text{Weight of each candied apple} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams}

1. Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Determine the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
3. Use the given information to find the total cost of twenty dozen cups.
4. Calculate the cost of each cup.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen is 6 plates and each plate costs $6000, the total cost for 6 plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of each cup is:

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of each pair of shoes is $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost of the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
Therefore, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara currently has and how much more she needs to earn. Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has after babysitting is:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]
The amount of money Sara still needs to earn is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4:

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.",10,10
mgsm-en-211,"To determine the number of red chickens Jerry has, we start by defining variables for the number of each type of chicken. Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens and \( w \) represent the number of white chickens. According to the problem, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can write:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

Next, we know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

We substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, we simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we calculate the number of white chickens and the total number of eggs:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4

2. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. Then we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the leaks empty the pools at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago can be expressed as follows:
- The big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.
- The small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two expressions for \( B \):
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Subtracting \( 2S \) from both sides, we get:
\[ 16 = 2S \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

4. Calculate their ages in three years.
5. Find the average of their ages in three years.

First, we know Harriet's current age is 21 years. Since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can calculate Adrian's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Next, since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we calculate their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66
\]
\[
\text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45

3. Add the amounts spent in the first and second years to find the total.

Let's start with the first year:
The company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year.

Next, we calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year. According to the problem, the company spends a third of the first year's amount on advertising in the second year. Therefore, the amount spent in the second year is:
\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Now, we add the amounts spent in the first and second years to find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years:
\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Thus, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\).",20000,20000

1. Calculate the new number of water type cards after losing 8 cards.
2. Calculate the total number of cards after the changes.
3. Determine the percentage of water type cards out of the total number of cards.

**Step 1: Calculate the new number of water type cards.**
James originally has 40 water type cards. After losing 8 cards, the number of water type cards is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cards.**
James originally has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. After buying 14 more grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes:

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]

First, we know that Dana skips at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since she skips at half the speed she runs, her running speed is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:

  2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of articles written over the three days.**

The total number of articles written is:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing the articles.**

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, the total number of hours spent writing the articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104

1. **Calculate the number of blue ties John bought:**
   John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of one red tie:**

polymath-low-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells the eggs at $2 per dozen. Therefore, the weekly revenue is:

polymath-low-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back from his destination, we need to know the distance he traveled initially. However, the problem does not specify the distance. Let's denote the distance from his starting point to the destination as \( D \) miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM at 10 miles per hour. The time taken for this part of the journey is given by:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours}
\]

After reaching the destination, Tom then travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel back is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both directions, we can express the total time for the round trip as:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30. Therefore, we rewrite the fractions:
\[
\frac{D}{10} = \frac{3D}{30} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{D}{6} = \frac{5D}{30}
\]

Adding these fractions gives:
\[
\frac{3D}{30} + \frac{5D}{30} = \frac{8D}{30} = \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time it takes Tom to get back is \(\boxed{\frac{4D}{15}}\) hours.",15,5
polymath-low-en-52,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag to reduce the total weight by 15 pounds, given that he has already removed 30 comic books.

First, let's calculate the weight of the 30 comic books:
\[ \text{Weight of 30 comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much weight is left to be removed from the book bag. Since the total weight to be removed is 15 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's denote the number of toys that need to be removed as \( t \). Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, so the total weight of the toys to be removed is:
\[ \text{Weight of } t \text{ toys} = t \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ pounds} \]

We set this equal to the remaining weight to be removed:
\[ t \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \]

To find \( t \), we solve the equation:
\[ t = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys.",15,15

Let's start with the given information:
- Total number of oranges = 25
- Percentage of unripe oranges = 20%
- Number of sour oranges = 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can find the number of unripe oranges as follows:
\[
\text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
\]

Next, we know the number of sour oranges is 2. Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of unripe and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[
\text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (\text{Number of unripe oranges} + \text{Number of sour oranges}) = 25 - (5 + 2) = 25 - 7 = 18

polymath-low-en-73,"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the cell phones, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the interest on the total cost.
3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total installment amount.
4. Divide the total installment amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of one cell phone is $150, and Shiela bought five cell phones.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since there are five cell phones, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times \frac{2}{100} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The total installment amount is the sum of the total cost before interest and the total interest:
   \[
   \text{Total installment amount} = 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount Shiela will pay each month is \(\boxed{255}\).",255,255
polymath-low-en-74,"To determine how much Artie will make, we first round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total revenue from each type of flower.

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Original price: $2.74
   - Rounded price: $3.00
   - Number of pots sold: 12
   - Revenue from marigolds: \( 12 \times 3.00 = 36.00 \)

2. **Petunias:**
   - Original price: $1.87
   - Rounded price: $2.00
   - Number of pots sold: 9
   - Revenue from petunias: \( 9 \times 2.00 = 18.00 \)

3. **Begonias:**

Thus, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88}\).",88,88
polymath-low-en-75,"To determine the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to find the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels as follows:
- Level 4 (top level): \( S_4 = 16 \)
- Level 3: \( S_3 = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
- Level 2: \( S_2 = 2 \times S_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)
- Level 1: \( S_1 = 2 \times S_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \)

Now, we sum the square footages of all levels:
\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 \]

Calculating the total:
\[ 128 + 64 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 32 = 224 \]
\[ 224 + 16 = 240 \]

The total square footage for all levels is 240.

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels (which is 4):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60
polymath-low-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the remaining days are:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For the rest of the puppy's life in the first year, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day. Therefore, the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required for 550 cups:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs to determine the better price:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.

The better price is $9, so Vincent saves:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked.**

The makeup artist works 6 hours each day and needs the makeup done 4 times a week. The movie lasts 5 weeks.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost of the house after the repairs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the final value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. The increase in value is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:

\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house after the repairs. The total cost is the original value of the house plus the cost of the repairs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, the profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

polymath-low-en-5,"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs only 60% of the price of a regular glass, which is $3.

First, let's break down the cost for every second glass. The cost of every second glass is $3. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, the number of second glasses is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \). Therefore, the total cost for the second glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 8 glasses, which are the first glasses. Since the first glass costs $5, the total cost for 8 first glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

polymath-low-en-6,"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[
\text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Number of sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:

polymath-low-en-7,"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break the problem into several steps.

1. Calculate the time taken to download the first 80 GB (40% of 200 GB).
   \[
   \text{Time for first 80 GB} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. During this time, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. So, the download is interrupted for 20 minutes.

3. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. Therefore, she needs to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   \[
   \text{Time for remaining 120 GB} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}

   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, at the end of 3 hours, John is 180 miles away from home.

2. **Standstill Traffic:**
   John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. During this time, he does not cover any distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0 \, \text{miles}

3. **Driving at 30 mph:**
   John drives for the next 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, after this segment, John is:
   \[
   180 \, \text{miles} - 15 \, \text{miles} = 165 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   away from home.

4. **Driving at 80 mph:**

Marissa has already walked:
- 4 miles in 1 hour
- 2 miles in another 1 hour

So, the total distance covered so far is:
\[4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles}\]

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is:
\[12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles}\]

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail to be 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:
\[\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}\]

Let \( t \) be the total time Marissa will take to complete the trail. The total distance is 12 miles, and the average speed is 4 miles per hour, so:
\[4 = \frac{12}{t}\]

Solving for \( t \):
\[t = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}\]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles), so the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:

3. Determine the total amount of water after spilling one liter of the orange drink.
4. Calculate the total volume of the mixed drink.
5. Determine the concentration of water in the mixed drink.
6. Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.**
The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.**
The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount of water after spilling one liter of the orange drink.**
After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of water from the orange drink left is:
\[ \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \text{ liters} \]
The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink is:
\[ \frac{17}{3} + 9 = \frac{17}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the mixed drink.**
The total volume of the mixed drink is:
\[ 24 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 5: Determine the concentration of water in the mixed drink.**
The concentration of water in the mixed drink is:
\[ \frac{\frac{44}{3}}{24} = \frac{44}{3} \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{44}{72} = \frac{11}{18} \]

**Step 6: Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink.**
The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{11}{18} = \frac{264}{18} = \frac{44}{3} \text{ liters} \]

polymath-low-en-21,"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Samantha's age when Raymond had his son.
2. Calculate the age difference between Raymond and Samantha.
3. Use the age difference to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond had his son at the age of 23, we can calculate Samantha's age when Raymond had his son:
\[ 31 - 23 = 8 \]
So, Samantha was 8 years old when Raymond had his son.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond was 23 years old when he had his son, and he is currently 23 + (31 - 8) = 46 years old, we can determine the age difference between Raymond and Samantha:
\[ 46 - 31 = 15 \]
This means Raymond is 15 years older than Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 8 years ago.

The final answer is:

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. Let's denote Darrell's current age by \(7x\) and Allen's current age by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's current age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\).
Allen's current age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to determine Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

2. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
3. \( W + B + Q = 700 \) (the total number of bees is 700)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ B = 2Q \]
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in the total number of bees equation:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested in that period.

First, we know that John harvests his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

4. **Calculate the number of bees that are in the hive at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there are no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave, so the number of bees in the hive is 0. After the next 6 hours, 15 bees return, so the number of bees in the hive is 15. After the next 6 hours, 60 bees leave, so the number of bees in the hive is \(15 - 60 = -45\). Since the number of bees cannot be negative, we assume the hive is empty at this point.
   \[
   \text{Bees in the hive at the end of the first 12 hours} = 0
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before the hive returns. The number of bees that left before the hive is the sum of the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that left in the next 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Total bees that left} = 30 + 60 = 90

mgsm-en-154,"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then extend it to the entire semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on each type of day:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times (2 \text{ hours/day} \times 2) = 2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours spent on both types of days to find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes each week:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes over the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in the semester, so:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\).",272,272
mgsm-en-155,"To determine the total length of all the baked goods Bill bakes in one day, we need to calculate the total length of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes separately, and then sum these lengths.

First, we calculate the total length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls each day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 croissants each day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, we calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes each day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the total lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes to find the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
- The total length is \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12:
- The total length in feet is \(\frac{3360}{12} = 280\) feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\).",280,280

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 50-yard line and back, which is a total of 100 yards per round trip. She then runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards per round trip. She does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 1 \times 100 + 34 \times 80 = 100 + 2720 = 2820 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2820 yards. The difference in the distance run is:
\[ 3000 - 2820 = 180 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner runs $\boxed{180}$ yards farther than the loser.",180,80

- Mortgage: $500/month

**Step 2: Calculate 50% more than the minimum payments.**

- Student loans: $300 \times 1.5 = $450/month
- Credit card: $200 \times 1.5 = $300/month
- Mortgage: $500 \times 1.5 = $750/month

**Step 3: Find the total annual payment by summing the annual payments for each debt.**

- Student loans: $450/month \times 12 months = $5400/year
- Credit card: $300/month \times 12 months = $3600/year
- Mortgage: $750/month \times 12 months = $9000/year

Total annual payment:

mgsm-en-174,"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's find the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for consistency:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, convert the total time back to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is \(\boxed{95}\).",95,95
mgsm-en-175,"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the cost of lemons.

First, let's find the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and make 20 glasses per gallon. If they made $25 in profit, we can denote the total revenue as \( R \) and the total cost as \( C \). The profit is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
\[ 25 = R - C \]

Next, we need to express the revenue \( R \) in terms of the number of gallons sold. Since they sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass is sold for $0.50, the revenue from one gallon is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]
So, if they made \( n \) gallons, the total revenue \( R \) is:
\[ R = 10n \]

The total cost \( C \) is the sum of the cost of lemons and the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost per gallon is:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the total cost \( C \) for \( n \) gallons is:
\[ C = 5n \]

Now we substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation:
\[ 25 = 10n - 5n \]
\[ 25 = 5n \]
\[ n = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount they spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the given information:
- Zaid's monthly salary is 6000$.
- He spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
- He spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
- He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
- He gives his daughter 200$ and 700$ to his wife.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on rent.**
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.**
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.**
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the donation to charity.**
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

**Step 5: Determine the remaining amount after the donation.**
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

**Step 6: Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.**
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \]

Thus, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is \(\boxed{350}\).",350,350

1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.
2. Use Bo's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Monic has.
3. Use Monic's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Bo's crabs} = 40 \]

Next, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are:
  \[
  10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}

mgsm-en-181,"To determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to establish the relationships between the quantities of the flowers Sandra ordered.

Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( c \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4c \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5c = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( c \) using the second piece of information:
\[
5c = 200
\]
\[
c = \frac{200}{5}
\]
\[
c = 40
\]

Now that we know \( c = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4c = 4 \times 40

mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of these two events and then find the difference in their likelihoods expressed as a percentage.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the probabilities and express this difference as a percentage. The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%

mgsm-en-186,"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as $x$.

Given that there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is $3x$. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is $3x \times 6 = 18x$.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of hamsters as $y$. Then, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is $5y$.

There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits, which is $18x + 5y + 20$.

According to the problem, the total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[18x + 5y + 20 = 160\]

Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation, we get:
\[18x + 5y = 140\]

We need to find integer values for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation. Let's solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
\[5y = 140 - 18x\]
\[y = \frac{140 - 18x}{5}\]

For $y$ to be an integer, $140 - 18x$ must be divisible by 5. Let's check the values of $x$ that satisfy this condition:

If $x = 5$, then:
\[140 - 18 \times 5 = 140 - 90 = 50\]
\[y = \frac{50}{5} = 10\]

So, $x = 5$ and $y = 10$ satisfy the equation. Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is $5$.

\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic.",225,225
polymath-low-en-91,"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we start by defining the number of pets each person has based on the information given.

1. We know that Cindy has 4 pets.
   \[
   \text{Cindy's pets} = 4
   \]

2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pets Marcia has as follows:
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pets Jan has as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. To find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we sum the number of pets each person has:
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets} = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28

Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age: \( A \)
- Jackson's age: \( J \)
- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James's age: \( H \)

From the problem, we know:
1. James is 10 years old: \( H = 10 \)
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( H = C - 1 \)
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)

First, substitute the value of \( H \) into the second equation:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now we know Corey's age is 11. Next, substitute \( C = 11 \) into the fourth equation to find Amy's age:
\[ A = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. Substitute \( A = 9 \) into the third equation to find Jackson's age:
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

So, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old.",4,4

1. Determine Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Use Lee's original time to find Gerald's original time.
3. Calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improvement.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find Gerald's new time after his speed improvement. The problem states that Gerald's speed improved by 10%. This means his new time is 90% of his original time. So, we calculate Gerald's new time as follows:

1. Identify the number of dogs.
2. Use the given ratio to find the number of cats.
3. Calculate the number of rabbits.
4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets.

Step 1: Identify the number of dogs.
The problem states that the number of dogs is 60.
\[ \text{Number of dogs} = 60 \]

Step 2: Use the given ratio to find the number of cats.
The problem states that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of rabbits.
The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. First, we find the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]
Then, the number of rabbits is:
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Step 4: Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets.
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boys in Grade 5.**

The total number of students is 200, and \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them are boys.
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of girls in Grade 5.**

The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys.
\[

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16 ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide 64 by 16:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

The total number of cars that left the motorway can be represented as:
\[ x + 20 - 5 \]

Since the original number of cars was 30, the number of cars remaining after some left and others entered is:
\[ 30 - (x + 20 - 5) = 30 - (x + 15) = 15 - x \]

Since no cars were left on the motorway at the end of the 30 minutes, we have:
\[ 15 - x = 0 \]

- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\). So, he watched \(0.5x\) hours on Wednesday.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which totals \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which totals \(2\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours of TV he watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours}\]

Combining the known values, we get:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]
\[0.5x = 7 - 5.5\]
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Sasha has 5 boards.
- Each board costs $16.
\[
\text{Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80
\]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the lumber:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180
\]

Since the problem does not specify the selling price per board, we assume she sells them at the same price as she bought them, which is the given cost per board.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
- Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
\[
\text{Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100
\]
- Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[
\text{Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 100 + 80 = 180
\]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 180 - 180 = 0
\]

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{0}\).",0,90
polymath-low-en-116,"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Since the total number of parts is 20, each part corresponds to \(\frac{120}{20} = 6\) teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is \(7 \times 6 = 42\).

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42
polymath-low-en-117,"To determine how much John paid for the shoes, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pairs of shoes John buys:**
   - John has 3 children.
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is:
     \[
     3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs/child} = 6 \text{ pairs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the shoes:**
   - Each pair of shoes costs $60.
   - John buys 6 pairs of shoes.
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount John paid is \(\boxed{360}\).",360,360
polymath-low-en-118,"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles initially at the port.
2. Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Find out how many containers were imported on the second day.

First, we know that initially, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles initially at the port is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. So, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
polymath-low-en-119,"To determine the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Determine Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Determine Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L \times 1.30 \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Determine Adrien's salary four years later.**

Four years later, Adrien's salary is 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So his new salary is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Determine Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, her new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (if necessary, but here it's already precise to two decimal places), the total salary is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]",92,95200
polymath-low-en-120,"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
2. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly usage.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Therefore, the number of sheets of paper he uses per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets of paper he uses in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of sheets of paper he uses per month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:
$\\boxed{240}$",240,240
polymath-low-en-121,"To determine the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael, we need to calculate the number of each type of fruit brought by each person and then sum them up.

First, let's identify the number of fruits Morisette brought:
- Apples: 5
- Oranges: 8

Next, let's calculate the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Apples: Since Kael brought twice the amount of apples that Morisette brought, Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Oranges: Since Kael brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought, Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, we sum up all the fruits:
- Total apples: \(5\) (from Morisette) + \(10\) (from Kael) = \(15\)
- Total oranges: \(8\) (from Morisette) + \(4\) (from Kael) = \(12\)

The total number of fruits is:
\[15 + 12 = 27\]

Thus, the total number of fruits they have is \(\boxed{27}\).",27,27
polymath-low-en-122,"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep schedule day by day and then sum the totals.

1. On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than on Monday, which is \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. On Wednesday, she also slept 2 hours less than on Monday, which is \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day.

Now, we can calculate the total sleep for each day and then sum them up:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

Adding these together:
\[8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 34\]

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is \(\boxed{34}\).",34,48
polymath-low-en-123,"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break the problem into two parts: the first part where she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first part:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we determine the remaining time after the first part:
\[
\text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie runs in the second part:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Remaining time} = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, we find the total distance Rosie runs by adding the distances from both parts:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50
polymath-low-en-124,"To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of letters needing stamps:**
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.

2. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamps:**
   Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Determine the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters:**
   After putting stamps on 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

4. **Calculate the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie began:**
   Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters and Jennie has already stamped 20 of them, the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie began is:
   \[
   30 - 20 = 10
   \]

Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10
