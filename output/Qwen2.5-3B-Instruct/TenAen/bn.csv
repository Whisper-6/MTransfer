mgsm-bn-47,"Question: John buys twice as many Red ties as Blue ties. The price of a Red tie is 50% more than a Blue tie. He spends $200 to buy Blue ties at $40 each. How much did he spend in total on ties?

First, let's calculate the number of Blue ties John bought:
\[ \text{Number of Blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on Blue ties}}{\text{Price per Blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Next, since he buys twice as many Red ties as Blue ties:
\[ \text{Number of Red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of Blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's find the price of a Red tie. Given that the price of a Red tie is 50% more than a Blue tie, and a Blue tie costs $40:
\[ \text{Price of Red tie} = \text{Price of Blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60 \]

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the Red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost of Red ties} = \text{Number of Red ties} \times \text{Price per Red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of the Blue ties and the Red ties gives the total expenditure:
\[ \text{Total expenditure} = \text{Total cost of Blue ties} + \text{Total cost of Red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, John spent a total of $800 on ties. The final answer is boxed as follows:

mgsm-bn-57,"Question: A bridge cannot carry more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck loaded with boxes of the same weight as the boxes on the bridge can cross the bridge. The combined weight of the truck driver and an empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Let's denote the weight of each box as \( x \) pounds. The weight of the bridge itself is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the truck driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the boxes on the truck is \( 5000 - 3755 = 2245 \) pounds. Since each box weighs \( x \) pounds, the maximum number of boxes \( n \) that can be loaded onto the truck is given by the inequality:

\[ n \cdot x \leq 2245 \]

Since we need to find the maximum number of boxes, we assume each box weighs the maximum possible weight that still allows the truck to cross the bridge. The weight of each box \( x \) must be less than or equal to 2245 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, we divide 2245 by \( x \) and take the integer part of the result. Since \( x \) can be any value up to 2245 pounds, the maximum number of boxes is:

\[ n = \left\lfloor \frac{2245}{x} \right\rfloor \]

To maximize \( n \), we assume \( x \) is as large as possible but still less than or equal to 2245 pounds. The maximum value of \( x \) is 2245 pounds, so:

\[ n = \left\lfloor \frac{2245}{2245} \right\rfloor = 1 \]

However, if we consider the possibility of \( x \) being slightly less than 2245 pounds, the maximum number of boxes would be:

\[ n = \left\lfloor \frac{2245}{2245} \right\rfloor = 1 \]

But if we consider the possibility of \( x \) being slightly more than 1 pound, the maximum number of boxes would be:

\[ n = \left\lfloor \frac{2245}{1} \right\rfloor = 2245 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 2245.

mgsm-bn-62,"Question: If Marsi has worked for the same company for 40 years, she will receive a $50,000/year annual pension. Starting from the 20th year, her pension increases by 5% annually. If she retires 30 years after starting, what will her annual pension be?

To solve this, we need to calculate the pension after 30 years of work, given the initial pension and the annual increase rate.

1. Initial pension at year 20: $50,000/year
2. Pension increases by 5% annually.

The formula for the future value of a pension after n years with an annual increase rate r is:
\[ P_{\text{future}} = P_{\text{initial}} \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{future}} \) is the future pension,
- \( P_{\text{initial}} \) is the initial pension ($50,000),
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (30).

Substituting the values:
\[ P_{\text{future}} = 50,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{30} \]
\[ P_{\text{future}} = 50,000 \times (1.05)^{30} \]

Calculating \( (1.05)^{30} \):
\[ (1.05)^{30} \approx 4.3219 \]

Thus:
\[ P_{\text{future}} = 50,000 \times 4.3219 \]
\[ P_{\text{future}} \approx 216,095 \]

Therefore, Marsi's annual pension at retirement will be approximately $216,095.

Calculate.

To solve this, let's break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Revenue per month = $140
   - Total revenue for the first half = $140 * 6 = $840

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Revenue per month = $140 * 0.90 = $126 (10% less than $140)
   - Total revenue for the second half = $126 * 6 = $756

3. **Total Revenue for the Year:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from the first half + Revenue from the second half
   - Total revenue = $840 + $756 = $1596

After filling up the tank, she drove 100 miles and needed to refill the tank with 4 gallons of gas. The manual states that the tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How far can Sofia drive on a full tank of gas?

To find out how far Sofia can drive on a full tank of gas, we first need to determine how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she drove 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the miles per gallon (mpg) can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, using the manual's stated capacity of 12 gallons, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank:

The measurements of the rooms form a geometric sequence with the first term \( a = 16 \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \).

To find the average measurement of one room, we sum the measurements of all the rooms and divide by the number of rooms:

\[ \text{Sum of the series} = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Where \( a = 16 \), \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( n = 16 \):

\[ \text{Sum} = 16 \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{16}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 16 \frac{1 - \frac{1}{65536}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 16 \times 2 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{65536}\right) = 32 \left(1 - \frac{1}{65536}\right) \]

\[ \text{Sum} = 32 - \frac{32}{65536} = 32 - \frac{1}{2048} = 32 - 0.00048828125 \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{n} = \frac{32 - 0.00048828125}{16} = 2 - 0.000030546875 \]

\[ \text{Average} \approx 2 \]

Therefore, the average measurement of one room is $\\boxed{2}$.",2,60

Cecilia bought a new dog food bowl. According to her veterinarian, for the first 180 days, she should feed the dog bowl 1 cup of dog food per day. After that, she should feed the dog bowl 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of the dog's life. If one bag contains 110 cups of dog food, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia need for the first year?

Let's calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year:

1. For the first 180 days:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

2. For the remaining 260 days (365 days - 180 days):
\[ 260 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 520 \text{ cups} \]

3. Total cups needed for the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 520 \text{ cups} = 700 \text{ cups} \]

4. Number of bags needed:
\[ \frac{700 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 6.36 \text{ bags} \]

Since Cecilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number:

A company pays each employee $600 per month. According to the company's pay raise policy, for those who have been with the company for five years or more, their annual salary increases by 10% each year from the starting salary. If Silvia has been with the company for only 5 years and will work for three more years before leaving, what will her annual salary be at the end of last December?

Answer:
Let's calculate Silvia's annual salary at the end of last December.

1. First, we need to find out Silvia's starting salary. Since the problem doesn't specify her starting salary, we'll denote it as S.
2. After 5 years, her salary will increase by 10% each year. So, after 5 years, her salary will be:
\[ S \times (1 + 0.10)^5 = S \times 1.10^5 \]
3. After working for 8 years (5 years already worked + 3 years to be worked), her salary will increase by another 10%:
\[ S \times 1.10^5 \times (1 + 0.10)^3 = S \times 1.10^5 \times 1.10^3 = S \times 1.10^8 \]
4. Calculating \(1.10^8\):
\[ 1.10^8 \approx 2.14358881 \]

Therefore, her annual salary at the end of last December will be approximately:
\[ S \times 2.14358881 \]

Since the problem doesn't specify the starting salary S, we can express the final answer in terms of S:
\[ \boxed{2.14358881S} \]

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine Gerald's original speed. Since Gerald can run 400 meters in 40 seconds, his speed is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

2. After increasing his speed by 10%, his new speed becomes:
   \[
   \text{New Speed} = 10 \text{ meters/second} \times 1.1 = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Gerald to run 400 meters at his new speed:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}

mgsm-bn-8,"Question: After driving a car at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, John realizes he has missed some important things and decides to go back home. He tries to go back home for 4 hours but spends 2 hours in traffic jams during the first 2 hours. For the next half an hour, he drives at a speed of 30 miles per hour, and for the remaining 4 hours, he drives at a speed of 80 miles per hour. How far from home is John after 4 hours?

To solve this, we calculate the distance John covers in each segment of his journey:
1. Distance covered in the first 2 hours at 60 miles per hour: \(2 \times 60 = 120\) miles.
2. Distance covered in the next 0.5 hours at 30 miles per hour: \(0.5 \times 30 = 15\) miles.
3. Distance covered in the last 4 hours at 80 miles per hour: \(4 \times 80 = 320\) miles.

Adding these distances together gives the total distance from home:
\(120 + 15 + 320 = 455\) miles.

Question:
Carlos is planting a garlic tree. It will cost $90 to plant the tree. Each year, 7 garlics will grow, and he can sell each for $1.5. It costs $3 a year to water and fertilize the tree. How many years will it take for Carlos to earn back his investment by selling the garlics from the tree?

Answer:
To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back his investment, we need to calculate his yearly profit and then divide the initial investment by this yearly profit.

1. Cost to plant the tree: $90
2. Cost to water and fertilize the tree per year: $3
3. Number of garlics per year: 7
4. Selling price per garlic: $1.5

First, calculate the yearly profit:
- Revenue from selling garlics: 7 garlics * $1.5 per garlic = $10.5
- Total yearly cost: $3 (water and fertilize) + $0 (no other yearly cost mentioned)
- Yearly profit: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, calculate the number of years needed to recover the initial investment:
- Initial investment: $90
- Yearly profit: $7.5
- Number of years to recover investment: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, the number of years it will take for Carlos to earn back his investment is $\\boxed{12}$.",12,13
mgsm-bn-13,"Question: If Melani has 5 back-up cleaners left, how many did she start selling with?

Melani sold one-third of her green houses, two red houses, and half of her orange houses. Let's denote the total number of back-up cleaners as B.

From the information given:
- One-third of B (green houses) = 5
- Two red houses = 2
- Half of B (orange houses) = 5

From the green houses:
\[ \frac{1}{3}B = 5 \]
\[ B = 5 \times 3 \]
\[ B = 15 \]

So, Melani had 15 back-up cleaners initially. 

Checking the orange houses:
\[ \frac{1}{2}B = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 15 = 7.5 \]
Since the number of houses must be a whole number, there seems to be a discrepancy. However, we can proceed with the given numbers and see if they fit the context.

From the red houses:
\[ 2 = 2 \]

Thus, the total number of houses she had initially is:
\[ 5 \text{ (green)} + 2 \text{ (red)} + 7.5 \text{ (orange)} = 14.5 \]

Given that the number of orange houses should be a whole number, let's re-evaluate the context. Assuming the total number of orange houses is indeed 5, we can proceed with:
\[ 15 \text{ total back-up cleaners} \]

Now, we need to determine how many she started selling with:
- Green houses: 5 (one-third of 15)
- Red houses: 2
- Orange houses: 5 (half of 10, but we use 5 as given)

Total number of houses she started selling:
\[ 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 \]

Therefore, Melani started selling with 12 back-up cleaners.

- Contemporary dancers = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
- Jazz dancers = 25% of 20 = 0.25 * 20 = 5 students

Now, subtract the number of contemporary and jazz dancers from the total number of students to find the number of hip-hop dancers:
- Hip-hop dancers = 20 - (4 + 5) = 20 - 9 = 11 students

Finally, calculate the percentage of hip-hop dancers:
- Percentage of hip-hop dancers = (11 / 20) * 100 = 55%

His financial advisor estimates that the market price of the item will increase by 2.5% this month, and the market price of the electronic gadget will increase by 1.2% this month. If the businessman wants to maximize profit this month, what is the maximum profit he can make?

Let's calculate the profit for each option:

1. **For the $5,000 item:**
   - Purchase price: $5,000
   - Market price increase: 2.5%
   - Selling price: $5,000 * (1 + 2.5/100) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **For the $8,000 electronic gadget:**
   - Purchase price: $8,000
   - Market price increase: 1.2%
   - Selling price: $8,000 * (1 + 1.2/100) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The maximum profit the businessman can make is $125.

If she wants to average a walking speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, at what speed (in miles per hour) must she walk the remaining distance?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Marie has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in 1 hour, totaling 6 miles in 2 hours.
2. Therefore, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
3. To average 4 miles per hour for the entire 12 miles, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours (since 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours).
4. To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}

mgsm-bn-38,"Question: John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and on the other two days, he runs half as long as the first day. How fast did he run (in miles per hour)?

Let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs half as long as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

Total time spent running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his speed in miles per hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of $\boxed{10}$.",10,10

Question in English:
Dana can run six times as fast as she can walk, but she can skip at one-sixth of her running speed. If she can skip 3 miles per hour, in how many miles can she travel in six hours if she walks for one-third of the time and runs for two-thirds of the time?

Answer:
Let's denote the walking speed as \( v_w \) and the running speed as \( v_r \). According to the problem, \( v_r = 6v_w \). We are also given that \( v_r = 3 \) miles per hour. Therefore, we can find \( v_w \) as follows:

\[ v_w = \frac{v_r}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, let's denote the total time as \( T = 6 \) hours. Dana walks for one-third of the time and runs for two-thirds of the time. So, the time spent walking is \( \frac{T}{3} \) and the time spent running is \( \frac{2T}{3} \).

The distance Dana walks in \( \frac{T}{3} \) hours is:

\[ \text{Distance walked} = v_w \times \frac{T}{3} = 0.5 \times \frac{6}{3} = 0.5 \times 2 = 1 \text{ mile} \]

The distance Dana runs in \( \frac{2T}{3} \) hours is:

\[ \text{Distance run} = v_r \times \frac{2T}{3} = 3 \times \frac{2 \times 6}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana travels in six hours is the sum of the distance she walked and the distance she ran:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 1 + 12 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Answer:
To find out how many pieces of pie the guests ate, we first need to determine the total number of pie pieces available. Mrs. Johnson cut each of the five pies into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is:

5 pies × 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end, 14 pieces were left, so the number of pieces the guests ate is:

Let's calculate the profit step by step:

1. Calculate the total cost of making 20 tedpairs:
   - Cost of 20 pounds of mom: 20 pounds * $10.00/pound = $200.00
   - Cost of 20 eggs: 20 eggs * $1.00/egg = $20.00
   - Total cost: $200.00 + $20.00 = $220.00

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 tedpairs:
   - Revenue from 20 tedpairs: 20 tedpairs * $2.00/tedpair = $40.00

Let's calculate the number of posts Meredith wrote each day:

- On Monday, she wrote 5 posts.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) posts.
- On Wednesday, she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) posts.

In a group of 200 grade 5 students, 2/5 of them are scouts and 2/3 of them are boys. How many girls are there in the scout group?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Determine the number of boys:
   - Total students = 200
   - Fraction of boys = 2/3
   - Number of boys = \( 200 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{400}{3} = 133.33 \approx 133 \) (since we can't have a fraction of a student, we assume 133 boys)

2. Determine the number of scouts:
   - Fraction of scouts = 2/5
   - Number of scouts = \( 200 \times \frac{2}{5} = 80 \)

3. Determine the number of girls:
   - Total students = 200
   - Number of boys = 133
   - Number of girls = 200 - 133 = 67

4. Verify the scouts:
   - Number of girls in scouts = \( 80 - 133 = -53 \) (This step shows a contradiction, indicating an error in the initial assumption. Let's recheck the fractions and calculations.)

Rechecking the fractions:
- Fraction of scouts = 2/5
- Number of scouts = \( 200 \times \frac{2}{5} = 80 \)
- Fraction of boys = 2/3
- Number of boys = \( 200 \times \frac{2}{3} = 133.33 \approx 133 \)

Given the fractions, the number of scouts and boys should be consistent. Let's assume the correct number of scouts and boys are 80 and 133 respectively.

Therefore, the number of girls in the scout group is:

If the whiteboard is erased 3 times for each chapter, how many times is the whiteboard erased in a day?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is erased in a day. 

Each teacher reads 2 chapters a day, so in total, 4 teachers read 4 chapters a day. Since the whiteboard is erased 3 times for each chapter, the total number of erasures in a day is 4 chapters * 3 erasures per chapter = 12 erasures.

Therefore, the whiteboard is erased 12 times in a day.

Let's break it down:
- Ryan initially collected 2 flowers.
- If 5 more flowers don't bloom, it means 5 flowers will not be added to the initial collection.

So, the total number of flowers will be:

Question: Jamal captures six times more photos from the British phone than from his own phone. The total number of photos captured from the British phone is more than five times the total number of birds in Jamal's photo of the roosting storks by Jamal's house by 50 times. If Jamal captures 1800 photos from his phone, how many storks will be visible in Jamal's photo of the roosting storks?

Answer:
Let's denote the number of photos from the British phone as B, the number of photos from Jamal's phone as J, and the number of storks in Jamal's photo as S.

From the problem, we know:
1. J = 6B
2. B = 5S + 50J

Given that J = 1800, we can substitute this value into the equations.

First, substitute J into the first equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Now, substitute B into the second equation:
\[ 300 = 5S + 50 \times 1800 \]
\[ 300 = 5S + 90000 \]
\[ 5S = 300 - 90000 \]
\[ 5S = -89700 \]
\[ S = \frac{-89700}{5} \]
\[ S = -17940 \]

Since the number of storks cannot be negative, it seems there might be an inconsistency in the problem's conditions. However, assuming the problem's conditions are correct, the number of storks in Jamal's photo is -17940. 

Given the context, the number of storks should be a positive value, so we conclude there's an error in the problem's setup. 

Therefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",0,6

After buying some sheet of wood, Sasha realizes that the price of the wood sheet has increased by 50% in the past few months. Since he doesn't have enough left, he decides to sell the remaining ones. He has 10 pieces of boards with dimensions 2x4x10, each bought for $10. He also has 5 boards with dimensions 4x4x10, each bought for $16. If he sells all of them, how much profit will he make?

Let's calculate the total cost and the total selling price:

1. Cost of 10 boards with dimensions 2x4x10, each bought for $10:
   10 boards * $10/board = $100

2. Cost of 5 boards with dimensions 4x4x10, each bought for $16:
   5 boards * $16/board = $80

3. Total cost:
   $100 + $80 = $180

4. Selling price of 10 boards with dimensions 2x4x10:
   10 boards * $20/board = $200

5. Selling price of 5 boards with dimensions 4x4x10:
   5 boards * $24/board = $120

6. Total selling price:
   $200 + $120 = $320

To solve this, we need to understand that the total units (120) are divided in the ratio 7:13:1 for tea, coffee grounds, and sugar respectively. 

First, we calculate the sum of the ratio parts:
\[ 7 + 13 + 1 = 21 \]

Next, we find the value of one unit by dividing the total units by the sum of the ratio parts:
\[ \frac{120}{21} = \frac{40}{7} \]

Now, we calculate the amount of sugar used by multiplying the value of one unit by the sugar ratio part:
\[ \text{Sugar used} = \left(\frac{40}{7}\right) \times 1 = \frac{40}{7} \]

Converting this to a decimal for clarity:

Question:
Adrian's total salary was 30% more than Layler's. Four years later, his salary increased, and he earned 40% more than Layler did four years ago. If Adrian and Layler's salaries increased by the same percentage and Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago, then calculate the total salary they earned together four years later?

Answer:
Let's denote the percentage increase in salary as \( x \).

Four years ago, Adrian's salary was $40,000. Therefore, his salary four years later would be:
\[ 40,000 \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) \]

Four years ago, Layler's salary was \( \frac{40,000}{1.3} \) (since Adrian's salary was 30% more than Layler's). Therefore, Layler's salary four years later would be:
\[ \frac{40,000}{1.3} \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) \]

According to the problem, four years ago, Adrian earned 40% more than Layler did, so:
\[ 40,000 = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \times 1.4 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 40,000 = \frac{40,000 \times 1.4}{1.3} \]
\[ 40,000 = 40,000 \times \frac{1.4}{1.3} \]
\[ 1 = \frac{1.4}{1.3} \]
\[ 1.3 = 1.4 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 1.3x = 40,000 \times 0.4 \]
\[ 1.3x = 16,000 \]
\[ x = \frac{16,000}{1.3} \]
\[ x = 12,307.69 \]

Thus, the percentage increase \( x \) is approximately 12.31%.

Now, let's calculate Adrian's and Layler's salaries four years later:
Adrian's salary:
\[ 40,000 \times (1 + \frac{12.31}{100}) = 40,000 \times 1.1231 = 44,924 \]

Layler's salary:
\[ \frac{40,000}{1.3} \times (1 + \frac{12.31}{100}) = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \times 1.1231 = 30,769.23 \times 1.1231 = 34,369.23 \]

Total salary four years later:
\[ 44,924 + 34,369.23 = 79,293.23 \]

Jeni is helping her mom sort the letters. There are 60 letters that need stamps, and one letter has already had a stamp applied. Jeni has applied stamps to one-third of the remaining letters so far. If there are now 30 letters left to apply stamps to, how many letters were there initially in the batch?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the initial number of letters be \( x \).
2. One letter has already had a stamp applied, so \( x - 1 \) letters remain.
3. Jeni has applied stamps to one-third of the remaining letters, so she has applied stamps to \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 1) \) letters.
4. According to the problem, there are now 30 letters left to apply stamps to, which means the number of letters that have already had stamps applied is \( x - 1 - 30 = \frac{1}{3}(x - 1) \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ x - 1 - 30 = \frac{1}{3}(x - 1) \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ x - 31 = \frac{1}{3}(x - 1) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(x - 31) = x - 1 \]
\[ 3x - 93 = x - 1 \]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 2x - 93 = -1 \]

Add 93 to both sides:
\[ 2x = 92 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ x = 46 \]

So, the initial number of letters was 46.

If 4 turmeric, 20 peppers, and 10 cloves are purchased, and the price of one pepper is 15 dollars, how much money will he spend in total?

Answer in English:
To find out how much Weller's mother will spend in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the price of one turmeric. Given that the price of one pepper is 15 dollars and the price of one turmeric is three times the price of one pepper:
\[ \text{Price of one turmeric} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the price of one clove. Given that the price of one clove is 5 dollars less than the price of one turmeric:

To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total earnings from both patients and the hospital, and then subtract the total expenses.

First, calculate the total time spent seeing patients:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]
Convert minutes to hours:
\[ 12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the earnings from the patients:
\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40000 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the earnings from the hospital:

mgsm-bn-140,"Question: Among the 20 cars available at a higher price, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic cars. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
   \[
   20 - 12 - 4 = 4
   \]

2. Now, we need to calculate what percentage 4 semi-automatic cars represent out of the total 20 cars. The formula for percentage is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the numbers:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is $\boxed{20}$.",20,20
mgsm-bn-188,"Question: A businessman bought some baskets of tomatoes from a farmer at $20 per basket. If it costs $2 to transport each basket and the businessman made a profit of $400 by selling each basket for $30, how many baskets did he sell?

Let's denote the number of baskets sold by the businessman as \( x \).

The cost to buy \( x \) baskets is \( 20x \).
The cost to transport \( x \) baskets is \( 2x \).
So, the total cost for the businessman is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

The total revenue from selling \( x \) baskets at $30 each is \( 30x \).

The profit is the revenue minus the cost, and we know the profit is $400. So we can set up the following equation:
\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, the businessman sold \(\boxed{50}\) baskets.",50,50

For attending the fair, three friends spent $20.25 for 3 tickets. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also rode 2 different rides each, costing $33 per ride. If they agreed to equally share all the expenses, how much money would each person get?

Answer:
To find out how much money each person would get, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by 3.

1. Total cost for tickets: $20.25
2. Total cost for food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
3. Total cost for rides: 2 rides * $33/ride = $66
4. Total expenses: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102

Now, we divide the total expenses by 3 to find out how much each person would get:
$102 / 3 = $34

Let's calculate the number of trees left with Tom after 10 years.

1. **Initial number of trees:** 50
2. **Trees planted each year:** 10
3. **Trees cut each year:** 2

First, calculate the net increase in trees each year:
\[ 10 \text{ (planted)} - 2 \text{ (cut)} = 8 \text{ (net increase)} \]

Now, calculate the total number of trees after 10 years with the net increase:
\[ 50 \text{ (initial)} + 8 \text{ (net increase per year)} \times 10 \text{ (years)} = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

Next, calculate 30% of the total trees that are cut:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 130 = 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, subtract the number of cut trees from the total number of trees to find the number of trees left:

They live in a lively neighborhood. At the end of the week, the neighbors agreed to have fun with Sul. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 red plastic flamingos in Sul's front yard. On Saturday morning, they took back one-third of the flamingos and painted them white, and they brought new white flamingos to Sul's front yard. On Saturday afternoon, they added another 18 red plastic flamingos to their collection. On Saturday afternoon, how many more red plastic flamingos were there than white plastic flamingos?

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 18 red plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, they took back one-third of the flamingos:
   \[
   \text{One-third of 18} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, they took back 6 flamingos and left 12 red flamingos.
3. They painted the taken flamingos white and added 18 new white flamingos:
   \[

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the cost of a pen be \( P \).
2. Let the cost of an eraser be \( E \).
3. According to the problem, \( P + E = P \).
4. Given \( P = 1.20 \) and \( E = 0.30 \).

From the equation \( P + E = P \), we can deduce:

Mark is a copy editor. Each week, he edits the same number of sentences for two different publishers, who each offer a different price per sentence. Publisher K offers a price P, and Publisher X offers twice that price, or 2P, per sentence. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher X pays him 5 cents per sentence. How many cents does Mark earn each week?

To solve this, let's denote the number of sentences Publisher K and Publisher X receive as x and (1000 - x) respectively.

The total earnings for Mark can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = x \cdot P + (1000 - x) \cdot 2P + 5 \cdot (1000 - x) \]

Given that Mark edits 1000 sentences in a week and Publisher X pays him 5 cents per sentence, we can simplify the equation:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 1000 \cdot 5 + x \cdot (2P - P) \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + x \cdot P \]

Since Mark edits 1000 sentences and Publisher X pays 5 cents per sentence, the earnings from Publisher X would be:
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher X} = 5 \cdot (1000 - x) \]

The earnings from Publisher K would be:
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher K} = x \cdot P \]

Since the total earnings from both publishers should equal the total earnings calculated earlier:
\[ x \cdot P + 5 \cdot (1000 - x) = 5000 + x \cdot P \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 5000 - 5x = 5000 \]
\[ 5x = 5000 \]
\[ x = 1000 \]

This means that Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher K and 0 sentences for Publisher X. Therefore, the earnings from Publisher K are:
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher K} = 1000 \cdot P \]

Since Publisher X pays 5 cents per sentence, the total earnings from Publisher X are:
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher X} = 5 \cdot 1000 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total earnings for Mark in a week are:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 1000 \cdot P \]

Given that Publisher X pays 5 cents per sentence, we can assume \( P = 5 \) cents. Thus:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 1000 \cdot 5 = 5000 + 5000 = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark earns $\\boxed{10000} each week.",10000,7500

If he earns $2000 per week, how much money will he have earned by the end of the year, considering he receives the award at the beginning of the year and the salary raise at the beginning of the year?

Let's break down the calculation:

1. **One-time cash award**: $5000
2. **Salary raise**: 5% of $2000
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100

- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Weekly earnings = $2100
- Total earnings from weekly salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200

He has also eaten more cheese than he took from his cheese every morning for 3 days at breakfast. He has made more than 8 slices of cheese in sandwiches for 8 days. How many slices of cheese has he used in total this week?

To solve this, we calculate the slices of cheese used for the sandwiches and the extra slices used for breakfast.

1. Sandwiches: He eats a sandwich every day, and each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. There are 7 days in a week, so the total slices used for sandwiches is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \]

According to the problem, the total value of half a dozen plates is $600 less than the value of twelve cups. This can be written as:
\[ 6p = 12c - 600 \]

We need to find the value of $c$. To do this, we first simplify the equation:

Jerry has two water tanks, and each has a hole that lets out 4 gallons of water per minute. Four minutes ago, the big tank had twice as much water as the small tank. Now, the big tank has four times as much water as the small tank. How much water is currently in the small tank?

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Let's denote the amount of water in the small tank now as S gallons.
2. According to the problem, four minutes ago, the big tank had four times as much water as the small tank. So, four minutes ago, the big tank had 4S gallons.
3. Since the big tank loses 4 gallons per minute, it lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water in those four minutes.
4. Therefore, four minutes ago, the big tank had 4S - 16 gallons.
5. Now, the big tank has four times as much water as the small tank, so it has 4S gallons.
6. The difference between the current amount in the big tank and the amount four minutes ago is 4S - (4S - 16) = 16 gallons.
7. This means that in the four minutes, the small tank also lost 16 gallons of water.
8. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small tank as S gallons. Four minutes ago, the small tank had S - 16 gallons.
9. Since the small tank loses 4 gallons per minute, in four minutes, it lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.
10. Therefore, four minutes ago, the small tank had S - 16 gallons, and now it has S gallons.
11. This implies that the small tank lost 16 gallons in four minutes, so its current amount of water is S = 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the small tank is $\\boxed{16}$.",16,8

First, let's calculate the extra amount Jenith promised to give:
Extra amount = 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, the total amount Jenith promised to return is:
Total return amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's calculate the total amount Jenith will have paid back after 12 months:
Total paid back = $165 * 12 = $1980

Finally, let's find out how much more money Jenith will have to pay back:
Remaining amount = Total return amount - Total paid back = $2200 - $1980 = $220

To solve the problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Jack.

Given:
- Harry's current age (H) = 21 years
- Adrian's age (A) = 3 * Harry's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years
- Harry's age is half of Jack's age (J), so J = 2 * H = 2 * 21 = 42 years

In 3 years:
- Harry's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years
- Jack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years

Now, we calculate the average age of Adrian, Harry, and Jack in 3 years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Adrian's age} + \text{Harry's age} + \text{Jack's age}}{3} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water.
2. The silencer uses 90 liters of water for the garden. So, the remaining water in the tank is:
   120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters
3. The rain collects twice as much water as what is already in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left in the tank, the rain collects:
   2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Dana can run six times as fast as she can walk, but she can skip at one-sixth of her running speed. If she can skip 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she walks for one-third of the time and runs for two-thirds of the time?

Answer:
First, let's calculate Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at one-sixth of her running speed, and she can run at 3 miles per hour, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{3 \text{ miles/hour}}{6} = 0.5 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends walking and running. Since she spends one-third of the time walking and two-thirds of the time running over a six-hour period:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she can cover while walking and running:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 0.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ mile} \]
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 3 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances covered while walking and running to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance walking} + \text{Distance running} = 1 \text{ mile} + 12 \text{ miles} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

polymath-low-bn-41,"Question: At the top of Mount Farbor, a huge dragon named Draggonpuff is raining fireballs from something above it, 1000 feet away. The only known weapon to kill Dragonpuff is the golden javelin that Poli can launch 400 feet away, but that distance is within the reach of Dragonpuff's fireball. However, if Poli carries a blue sapphire, he can launch the javelin 3 times farther, but only if he holds the sapphire. How much farther can Poli launch the javelin to hit Dragonpuff from where it stands, if he holds the sapphire?

Let's denote the distance Dragonpuff's fireball can reach as D. Given that Dragonpuff's fireball is 400 feet away, we have D = 400 feet.

If Poli holds the sapphire, he can launch the javelin 3 times farther, so the new distance he can launch the javelin is 3D. Thus, the new distance is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Therefore, if Poli holds the sapphire, he can launch the javelin 1200 feet away, which is 200 feet farther than the 1000 feet Dragonpuff's fireball can reach.

polymath-low-bn-43,"Question: According to nutritious information, there are 250 calories in one serving of a bag of chips. If a bag weighing 300 grams contains 5 servings and your daily calorie goal is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories so far, how many grams of chips can you eat?

First, let's calculate the total calories from one bag of chips:
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- There are 5 servings in one bag.
- Therefore, the total calories in one bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Next, let's determine how many more calories you can consume:
- Your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories:
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Therefore, the number of servings you can consume with 200 calories = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

Finally, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat:
- There are 5 servings in one bag, and each serving weighs 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams per serving.
- Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat = 0.8 servings * 60 grams/serving = 48 grams.

Question: Charlie wants to sell mommies. For every pound of mom, he can make 10 tedpairs. It costs $10 to buy one pound of mom and one can. If he sells each tedpair for $2, how much profit will Charlie make if he makes and sells 20 tedpairs?

Answer:
1. First, calculate the total cost of making 20 tedpairs:
   - Cost of one pound of mom = $10
   - Cost to make 10 tedpairs from one pound of mom = $10
   - Therefore, cost to make 20 tedpairs (2 times 10 tedpairs) = 2 * $10 = $20

2. Next, calculate the total revenue from selling 20 tedpairs:
   - Selling price of one tedpair = $2
   - Total revenue from selling 20 tedpairs = 20 * $2 = $40

3. Finally, calculate the profit:

He said that the number of baby harp seals among the seals he had received was three times the number of hooded seals, and the number of grey seals was 12. How many baby seals are there in Mr. Doubtfire's family now?

Let's denote the number of hooded seals as H and the number of grey seals as G. According to the problem, we have:
- H = 12
- H + G = 7
- The number of baby harp seals (B) is 3H

First, substitute H = 12 into the equation H + G = 7:
\[ 12 + G = 7 \]
\[ G = 7 - 12 \]
\[ G = -5 \]

Since the number of grey seals cannot be negative, it seems there may be an inconsistency in the problem statement. However, we can still calculate the number of baby harp seals:
\[ B = 3H = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Given the inconsistency, let's assume the problem meant to say the total number of seals is 7 and the ratio of hooded to grey seals is 1:1. Then:
\[ H = 3, G = 4 \]
\[ B = 3H = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

The combined weight of the truck driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Let's denote the weight of each box as 15 pounds and the weight of the driver and the empty truck as 3755 pounds. Let \( x \) be the number of boxes. The total weight of the boxes will be \( 15x \) pounds.

To solve this, we need to calculate the pension amount after 30 years of work. 

Marci's pension starts at $50,000/year and increases by 5% each year for the next 20 years (from year 20 to year 30).

The formula for the future value of an annuity with a constant growth rate is:
\[ FV = P \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right) \]
where:
- \( FV \) is the future value of the annuity,
- \( P \) is the annual payment (pension),
- \( r \) is the growth rate,
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

Plugging in the values:
- \( P = 50,000 \)
- \( r = 0.05 \)
- \( n = 20 \)

\[ FV = 50,000 \times \left( \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{20} - 1}{0.05} \right) \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.05)^{20} \):
\[ (1.05)^{20} \approx 2.6533 \]

Then, calculate the numerator:
\[ 2.6533 - 1 = 1.6533 \]

Now, divide by the growth rate:
\[ \frac{1.6533}{0.05} = 33.066 \]

Finally, multiply by the annual pension:
\[ FV = 50,000 \times 33.066 = 1,653,300 \]

Therefore, Marci's annual pension after 30 years of work will be $1,653,300.

There is a flower shop selling one type of artichoke, one type of poblano, and one type of tomatillo. The farmer sells them at the market: artichokes at $2.74 per pound, poblanos at $1.87 per pound, and tomatillos at $2.12 per pound. Since there is no shortage at Arti's, she decides to pay all prices in the nearest whole dollar. If Arti sells 12 pounds of artichokes, 9 pounds of poblanos, and 17 pounds of tomatillos, how much money will she earn?

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Initially, there were 24 fries for the Griffin.
2. Kayle took 5 fries, so 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Bill took twice as many as Kayle, so Bill took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
4. After Bill took his share, 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
5. Gwen gave one-fourth of the initial 24 fries to the Griffin, so Gwen gave 24 / 4 = 6 fries to the Griffin.
6. After Gwen gave the fries, 9 + 6 = 15 fries left.
7. Kayle then took 3 less fries than the remaining 15, so Kayle took 15 - 3 = 12 fries.
8. After Kayle took his share, 15 - 12 = 3 fries left.

To solve this, we first need to calculate the original cost of the house including the repairs. The house was sold for $50,000, and this represents a 150% increase from the original cost. Let's denote the original cost as C.

The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Original Cost} + 150\% \times \text{Original Cost} \]
\[ 50,000 = C + 1.5C \]
\[ 50,000 = 2.5C \]
\[ C = \frac{50,000}{2.5} \]
\[ C = 20,000 \]

So, the original cost of the house including repairs was $20,000. Josh initially paid $80,000 for the house and then spent $20,000 on repairs, making the total cost $100,000. He then sold it for $50,000.

The profit Josh made is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 50,000 - 100,000 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = -50,000 \]

If there are 20 mice in the cage, how many cups of the mixture does Wendy need to feed all the mice by the end of the day?

To solve the problem:
- Morning feeding per mouse: 15 cups
- Evening feeding per mouse: 25 cups
- Total feeding per mouse per day: 15 + 25 = 40 cups
- Number of mice: 20

Total cups of mixture needed for all mice:
40 cups/mouse * 20 mice = 800 cups

Therefore, Wendy needs 800 cups of the mixture to feed all the mice by the end of the day.

Kyle wants to buy 16 pieces of wood for his new apartment. One piece of wood costs $5, but for every second piece, the cost is only 60% of the original price. How much money does Kyle need to spend?

To solve this, we need to calculate the cost for 16 pieces of wood considering the discount for every second piece.

1. Cost for the first piece: $5
2. Cost for the second piece (60% of $5): $5 * 0.6 = $3
3. Cost for the third piece: $5
4. Cost for the fourth piece (60% of $5): $5 * 0.6 = $3
5. And so on...

This pattern continues, with every second piece costing $3 and the rest costing $5.

We can group the pieces into sets of 2 pieces each:
- For the first 8 pieces (4 sets of 2), the cost will be 4 pieces at $3 each and 4 pieces at $5 each.

Let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for 4 pieces at $3 each: 4 * $3 = $12
- Cost for 4 pieces at $5 each: 4 * $5 = $20
- Total cost for 8 pieces: $12 + $20 = $32

Since Kyle wants 16 pieces, we can double the cost for 8 pieces to get the total cost for 16 pieces:
- Total cost for 16 pieces: $32 * 2 = $64

Therefore, Kyle needs to spend $64.

There are twice as many buses at Toolu as there are in Charleston. There are four times as many buses at Seattle as there are in Charleston. If there are 20 buses in Seattle, how many buses in total are there altogether in Toolu, Charleston, and Seattle?

Answer in English:
To find the total number of buses in Toolu, Charleston, and Seattle, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of buses in Charleston.
2. Determine the number of buses in Toolu.
3. Add the number of buses from all three cities.

Given:
- Seattle has 20 buses.
- Seattle has 4 times as many buses as Charleston.
- Toolu has twice as many buses as Charleston.

Step 1: Calculate the number of buses in Charleston.
Since Seattle has 4 times as many buses as Charleston, we can write:
\[ \text{Number of buses in Seattle} = 4 \times \text{Number of buses in Charleston} \]
\[ 20 = 4 \times \text{Number of buses in Charleston} \]
\[ \text{Number of buses in Charleston} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of buses in Toolu.
Since Toolu has twice as many buses as Charleston, we can write:
\[ \text{Number of buses in Toolu} = 2 \times \text{Number of buses in Charleston} \]
\[ \text{Number of buses in Toolu} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of buses in all three cities.
\[ \text{Total number of buses} = \text{Number of buses in Toolu} + \text{Number of buses in Charleston} + \text{Number of buses in Seattle} \]
\[ \text{Total number of buses} = 10 + 5 + 20 = 35 \]

Therefore, the total number of buses in Toolu, Charleston, and Seattle is $\boxed{35}$.",35,260

Carlos is planting a garlic tree. It will cost $90 to plant the tree. Each year, he will get 7 garlics from it, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 per year to water and fertilize the tree. How many years will it take for Carlos to earn back his investment by selling the garlics from the tree?

Let's calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to earn back his investment.

1. Calculate the annual income from selling garlics:
   - Number of garlics per year: 7
   - Price per garlic: $1.5
   - Annual income: 7 garlics * $1.5/garlic = $10.5

2. Calculate the net annual profit after accounting for the cost of watering and fertilizing:
   - Annual cost for watering and fertilizing: $3
   - Net annual profit: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

3. Calculate the number of years required to recover the initial investment of $90:
   - Number of years = Initial investment / Net annual profit
   - Number of years = $90 / $7.5 = 12

Melani sold one-third of her green houses, two red houses, and the rest were half-orange houses. Let's denote the total number of back-up cleaners as X. According to the information given:

\[
\frac{1}{3}X + 2 + \frac{1}{2}X = X
\]

Combining the terms with X on the left side:

\[
\frac{1}{3}X + \frac{1}{2}X + 2 = X
\]

Finding a common denominator for the fractions (which is 6):

\[
\frac{2}{6}X + \frac{3}{6}X + 2 = X
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{5}{6}X + 2 = X
\]

Subtracting \(\frac{5}{6}X\) from both sides:

\[
2 = X - \frac{5}{6}X
\]

\[

His economic advisor estimates that the market value of the item will increase by 2.5% this month, and the market value of the electronic gadget will increase by 1.2% this month. If the businessman wants to maximize profit this month, what is the maximum profit he can make?

To calculate the maximum profit, we need to find the difference in the final value of each item after the respective price increases.

For the $5,000 item:
- Initial value = $5,000
- Increase = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125
- Final value = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the $8,000 electronic gadget:
- Initial value = $8,000
- Increase = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96
- Final value = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

The maximum profit would be the difference between the final value of the electronic gadget and the final value of the item:
- Maximum profit = $8,096 - $5,125 = $2,971

Therefore, the maximum profit the businessman can make is $\\boxed{2971}",2971,125

Marissa is walking a 12-mile path. She spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and an additional hour walking the next 2 miles. If she wants to average a walking speed of 4 miles per hour, at what pace (miles per hour) must she walk the remaining distance to achieve this?

Answer:
To determine the pace Marissa must walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has already spent walking and the remaining time she needs to walk at the desired average speed.

1. Total distance to be walked: 12 miles
2. Distance already walked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
3. Remaining distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour overall. We need to find out how much time she has already spent walking and how much time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

4. Time already spent walking: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
5. Total time required to walk 12 miles at 4 miles per hour: 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

6. Remaining time: 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

Now, we need to find the pace at which she must walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Calculate the amount of water in the initial orange drink:
   - Orange drink: 10 liters
   - Water content: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters

2. Calculate the amount of water in the initial pineapple drink:
   - Pineapple drink: 15 liters
   - Water content: \( \frac{5}{3} \times 15 = 25 \) liters

3. Calculate the total amount of water before pouring out one liter of orange drink:
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + 25 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{75}{3} = \frac{95}{3} \) liters

4. After pouring out one liter of orange drink, the amount of water remains the same because we are only pouring out a drink, not water:
   - Remaining water = \( \frac{95}{3} \) liters

5. Calculate the total volume after mixing:
   - Total volume = 10 liters (orange drink) + 15 liters (pineapple drink) = 25 liters

6. Calculate the amount of water in the final mixture:
   - Water content in the final mixture = \( \frac{95}{3} \) liters

7. Calculate the amount of water left in the remaining 24 liters:
   - Since we have 25 liters of the mixture, and we are left with 24 liters, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the same as the total water content in the mixture:
   - Water left = \( \frac{95}{3} \) liters

8. Convert \( \frac{95}{3} \) liters to a decimal for a clearer understanding:

mgsm-bn-142,"Question in English: If Jordan spends his time on work instead of playing video games, how much income can he earn in a week?

To solve this, we need to calculate the difference in income between playing video games and working.

1. Calculate the income from playing video games per day:
   - Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day.
   - Let's assume the income per hour of playing video games is $x.
   - Therefore, the daily income from playing video games = 2 * $x = $2x.

2. Calculate the income from working per day:
   - Jordan works part-time for 10 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the daily income from working = $10 * 1 = $10.

3. Calculate the difference in income per day:
   - Difference = Income from working - Income from playing video games = $10 - $2x.

4. Calculate the weekly income difference:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly income difference = 7 * ($10 - $2x) = $70 - $14x.

Since the question asks how much income Jordan can earn in a week if he works instead of playing video games, the answer is $70 - 14x.

First, we identify which items are not food. The items that are not food are the light bulb and the razor.

Next, we calculate the discount for these items:
- Discount on the light bulb: $3 \times 10\% = $0.30$
- Discount on the razor: $4 \times 10\% = $0.40$

Now, we subtract the discounts from the original prices of the light bulb and the razor:
- New price of the light bulb: $3 - $0.30 = $2.70$
- New price of the razor: $4 - $0.40 = $3.60$

Now, we calculate the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of milk: $2
- Total cost of butter: $3
- Total cost of the light bulb: $2.70
- Total cost of the cup: $3
- Total cost of the razor: $3.60

Adding these together:

Lucas started his own house cleaning business, and he is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. So far, he has 3 clients, but now he is talking to 5 potential clients and has considerable confidence that he will include them in his calculations. Each client will require 2 bottles of bleach and one packet of mop pads. The price of each bottle of bleach is $2 and the price of each packet of mop pads is $5. These are his only expenses. He has calculated that he will earn a total of $92 per week. The difference between total income and total expenses is the profit. How much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make per week?

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total expenses per week. Lucas has 3 clients and each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and one packet of mop pads.

Expenses for 3 clients:
- Bleach: \(3 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = \$12\)
- Mop pads: \(3 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ packet/client} \times \$5/\text{packet} = \$15\)

How many times did Deborah observe butterflies come and go in one day? In the first 6 hours, she observed 30 butterflies leaving. In the next 6 hours, she observed half of that number returning. In the first instance, she saw twice as many butterflies as she did in the first 6 hours. In the following 6 hours, all butterflies that left in the first 6 hours and did not return were observed returning to the butterfly house. In the last 6 hours of the day, Deborah observed how many butterflies returned to the butterfly house.

Answer:
To find the total number of butterflies Deborah observed, let's break down the information:

1. First 6 hours: 30 butterflies leave.
2. Next 6 hours: Half of 30 butterflies return, which is 15 butterflies.
3. First instance: Twice as many butterflies as in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 butterflies.
4. Following 6 hours: All butterflies that left in the first 6 hours and did not return (30 butterflies) return.

Now, let's calculate the total number of butterflies observed:

- Butterflies that left in the first 6 hours: 30
- Butterflies that returned in the next 6 hours: 15
- Butterflies that returned in the first instance: 60
- Butterflies that returned in the following 6 hours: 30

Total butterflies observed = 30 (left) + 15 (returned) + 60 (first instance) + 30 (following 6 hours) = 135

Steve is 3 miles from the school and can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim is 2 miles from the school and can skate at 264 feet per minute. How many minutes will it take for Tim to finish the race and wait for Steve at home?

To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance to their homes.

First, convert miles to feet:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet

Steve's distance in feet:
- 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance in feet:
- 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, calculate the time it takes for each to travel their respective distances:
- Time for Steve = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Time for Tim = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time is:

Shonda decided that their neighbor's children should be able to use the public bike pump to fill their bicycles. She also decided that the best way to cover the cost was to charge based on the tire. Filling one tire costs 25 cents. On that day, 5 people came with their bicycles to fill both tires. 3 people came to fill all the tires of their tricycles. Finally, one person came with a unicycle. How much money did she earn that day?

Answer:
To calculate the total earnings, we need to consider the number of people and the cost of filling the tires for each type of bicycle.

- For the bicycles, there were 5 people, and each filled 2 tires. So, 5 * 2 * 25 cents = 250 cents.
- For the tricycles, there were 3 people, and each filled 3 tires. So, 3 * 3 * 25 cents = 225 cents.
- For the unicycle, there was 1 person, and they filled 1 tire. So, 1 * 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Adding these amounts together: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

Question: Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate crosses, and 60 gummy worms every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each chocolate cross is 6 inches long, and each gummy worm is two feet long. If Bill keeps all the baked items from the very beginning to the end, how long would they be in total in feet?

Answer:
First, let's convert all lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this purpose.

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Chocolate crosses: 120 crosses * 6 inches/cross = 720 inches
- Gummy worms: 60 worms * 24 inches/worm = 1440 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now, let's add up the total length in inches:
Total length = 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

Answer: Let's break down the information given:
1. Sally Thirteen is 8 years old.
2. Sally Fore is the same age as Sally Thirteen, so Sally Fore is also 8 years old.
3. Grannie Red is twice as old as Sally Fore, so Grannie Red is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of the four birds:
- Cabus: 4 years (given)
- Grannie Red: 16 years
- Sally: 19 years
- Sally Fore: 8 years

Total age = 4 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 47

For student debt, it's at least $300/month, for credit card debt, it's at least $200/month, and for a secured debt, it's at least $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount, how much money will she pay over one year?

First, let's calculate the amount Jessica will pay for each type of debt if she pays 50% more than the minimum amount:

1. **Student Debt:**
   - Minimum: $300/month
   - 50% more: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month

2. **Credit Card Debt:**
   - Minimum: $200/month
   - 50% more: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month

3. **Secured Debt:**
   - Minimum: $500/month
   - 50% more: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Next, let's calculate the total amount Jessica will pay in a year for each type of debt:

- **Student Debt:**
  - Monthly payment: $450
  - Annual payment: $450 * 12 = $5400

- **Credit Card Debt:**
  - Monthly payment: $300
  - Annual payment: $300 * 12 = $3600

- **Secured Debt:**
  - Monthly payment: $750
  - Annual payment: $750 * 12 = $9000

Finally, let's sum up the total amount Jessica will pay over one year:

- Total annual payment: $5400 + $3600 + $9000 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 over one year.

Bill is cutting and peeling 60 potatoes for a big event. It takes him about 14 minutes to cut and peel each potato, but it only takes 5 seconds to cut each potato. How much time will Bill spend preparing the potatoes?

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Bill spends on peeling and cutting the potatoes.

1. Time to peel one potato = 14 minutes
2. Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes:
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = 60 * 14 minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = 60 * 5 seconds

Converting 5 seconds to minutes:
- 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes = 1/12 minutes

Now, calculate the total time:
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = 60 * 14 minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = 60 * (1/12) minutes

Let's do the calculations:
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = 60 * 14 = 840 minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = 60 * (1/12) = 5 minutes

Now, sum up the total time:
- Total time = 840 minutes + 5 minutes = 845 minutes

Finally, we need to convert 845 minutes into hours and minutes:
- 845 minutes = 14 hours and 5 minutes

So, the total time Bill spends preparing the potatoes is 845 minutes, which is 14 hours and 5 minutes.

Let's denote the cost of lemons per gallon as C_lemons and the cost of onions per gallon as C_onions. We know C_lemons = $3 and C_onions = $2. The selling price per glass is P_glass = $0.50 and the number of glasses per gallon is Glasses_per_gallon = 20.

The revenue per gallon is then P_glass * Glasses_per_gallon = $0.50 * 20 = $10.

The total cost per gallon is C_lemons + C_onions = $3 + $2 = $5.

The profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost, which is $10 - $5 = $5.

If the total profit is $25, then the number of gallons sold is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

The total cost for lemons is the cost per gallon times the number of gallons, which is $5 * 5 = $25.

Therefore, the total cost for lemons is $\\boxed{25}",25,15
mgsm-bn-176,"Question in English: In a relay race, there were 240 Asian participants, out of which 80 were Japanese. If the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60, how many girls were there in the Chinese team?

Let's denote the number of girls in the Chinese team as G.

The total number of participants in the Chinese team would be the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + G.

Since the total number of Asian participants is 240 and out of these, 80 are Japanese, the remaining participants must be from the Chinese and Japanese teams combined. So, the number of participants from the Chinese and Japanese teams combined is:

240 - 80 = 160

This means the sum of the Chinese team and the Japanese team participants is 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:

60 + G + 80 = 160

Solving for G:

140 + G = 160
G = 160 - 140
G = 20

So, there were 20 girls in the Chinese team.

Question: Jad gives 1/4 of his salary as a bonus, spends 1/3 of it on car repairs, and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter $200 from his weekly expenses and his wife $700 from his grocery and household supplies budget. If Jad earns $6000 per month, how much money will he have left after all expenses and donations?

Answer:
To solve this, let's break down the monthly expenses and donations:

1. **Salary**: $6000
2. **Bonus**: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
3. **Spending on car repairs**: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000
4. **Donation to charity**: Half of the remaining amount after bonus and car repairs
   - Remaining after bonus: $6000 - $1500 = $4500
   - Remaining after car repairs: $4500 - $2000 = $2500
   - Donation to charity: 1/2 of $2500 = $1250
5. **Weekly expenses**: $200
6. **Grocery and household supplies**: $700

Now, let's sum up all the expenses and donations:

- Bonus: $1500
- Car repairs: $2000
- Donation to charity: $1250
- Weekly expenses: $200
- Grocery and household supplies: $700

Total expenses and donations = $1500 + $2000 + $1250 + $200 + $700 = $5650

Finally, subtract the total expenses and donations from the monthly salary:

$6000 - $5650 = $350

Therefore, the amount of money Jad will have left after all expenses and donations is $\\boxed{350}$.",350,350

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Jan's age two years ago:**
   Jan is 30 years old now, so two years ago, she was:
   \[
   30 - 2 = 28 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**

Rose is not used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of rose are distributed among the rats, how many rats are there in each cage?

Answer:
Let's denote the number of rats as R.

Since each rat receives 6 pieces of rose, the total number of pieces of rose distributed to rats is 6R.

polymath-low-bn-83,"Question in English: Dan planted 3 pea trees. Each pea tree has 25 peas. Each pea has 8 tendrils. How many tendrils are there in total?

To solve this, we need to multiply the number of trees by the number of peas per tree, and then multiply that result by the number of tendrils per pea:
1. Number of trees = 3
2. Peas per tree = 25
3. Tendrils per pea = 8

Total tendrils = Number of trees × Peas per tree × Tendrils per pea
Total tendrils = 3 × 25 × 8
Total tendrils = 75 × 8
Total tendrils = 600

Therefore, the total number of tendrils is $\\boxed{600}$.",600,600
polymath-low-bn-84,"Question in English: A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. How many games did they win in total?

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L. Then the number of games they won would be L + 8. The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22. So we have:

L + (L + 8) = 22

Now, let's solve for L:

2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 7

So, they lost 7 games. Therefore, the number of games they won is:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the number of nutrients Jan has be \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Martia has three times more nutrients than Jan, so Martia has \( 3J \) nutrients.
3. Cindy has two more nutrients than Martia, and we know Cindy has 4 nutrients. Therefore, \( 3J + 2 = 4 \).
4. Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   3J + 2 = 4 \\
   3J = 2 \\
   J = \frac{2}{3}

Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Korri, and James as A, J, K, and J respectively.

From the information given:
1. A = J + 5
2. K = A - 2
3. J = 10
4. J = K - 1

Since J = 10, we can substitute this into the fourth equation to find K:
10 = K - 1
K = 11

Now we know Korri is 11 years old. Using the second equation, we can find Amy's age:
K = A - 2
11 = A - 2
A = 13

Now we know Amy is 13 years old. Using the first equation, we can find Jackson's age:
A = J + 5

polymath-low-bn-93,"Question: If Lee can run 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds, how long will Gerald be able to run 400 meters hurdles after increasing his speed by 10%?

To solve this, we first need to find Gerald's original speed in meters per second. Since Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, Lee's speed is:
\[ \text{Lee's speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \]

Gerald's original speed can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Gerald's original speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{\text{Gerald's original time}} \]

Given that Gerald's speed increases by 10% after changing his diet, his new speed will be:
\[ \text{Gerald's new speed} = \text{Gerald's original speed} \times 1.10 \]

We need to find the time Gerald will take to run 400 meters at his new speed:
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{\text{Gerald's new speed}} \]

Let's calculate Gerald's original time and then his new time.
\[ \text{Gerald's original speed} = \frac{400}{\text{Gerald's original time}} \]

Since we don't know Gerald's original time, let's denote it as \( t \). Therefore:
\[ \text{Gerald's original speed} = \frac{400}{t} \]

With the 10% increase:
\[ \text{Gerald's new speed} = \frac{400}{t} \times 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate Gerald's new time:
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{400}{\frac{400}{t} \times 1.10} = \frac{400 \times t}{400 \times 1.10} = \frac{t}{1.10} \]

Given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, we can use this to find Gerald's original time \( t \):
\[ \frac{400}{t} = \frac{400}{38} \]
\[ t = 38 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we calculate Gerald's new time:
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{38}{1.10} \approx 34.545 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald will be able to run 400 meters hurdles in approximately 34.545 seconds with the new diet.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of wolves:**
   - Given that there are 60 dogs and for each dog there are 2 wolves.
   - Therefore, the number of wolves = 60 dogs * 2 wolves/dog = 120 wolves.

2. **Determine the number of mixed wolves:**
   - According to the problem, the number of mixed dogs and wolves is 20 less than the number of mixed wolves.
   - Let the number of mixed wolves be \( W \).
   - Then, the number of mixed dogs and wolves is \( W - 20 \).
   - Since the number of mixed dogs and wolves is equal to the number of dogs, we have:
     \[
     W - 20 = 60
     \]
   - Solving for \( W \):
     \[
     W = 60 + 20 = 80
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of mixed wolves is 80.

3. **Determine the total number of mixed animals:**
   - The total number of mixed animals is the sum of mixed dogs and mixed wolves:
     \[
     \text{Total mixed animals} = \text{Mixed dogs} + \text{Mixed wolves}
     \]
   - Since the number of mixed dogs is 60 and the number of mixed wolves is 80:

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the number of girls in the group:
   - The total number of students is 200.
   - The fraction of girls is 2/3.
   - Number of girls = \( 200 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{400}{3} \approx 133.33 \).
   - Since the number of students must be a whole number, we will consider 133 girls (assuming rounding down is appropriate in this context).

2. Calculate the number of scouts:
   - The fraction of scouts is 2/5.
   - Number of scouts = \( 200 \times \frac{2}{5} = 80 \).

3. Determine the number of girls in the scout group:
   - We know there are 133 girls in total.

Translation of the question into English: Mary is an enthusiastic gardener. Last night, she received 18 new saplings from her favorite tree nursery. Meanwhile, there are saplings along the edges of her spacious house, with 2 saplings per window. There are 40 windows on her house. Mary decides to give away 1 sapling from each window to her friends and family members tomorrow. How many saplings will Mary have left?

To find out how many saplings Mary will have left, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of saplings along the edges of her house:
   - There are 40 windows, and 2 saplings per window.
   - Total saplings along the edges = 40 windows * 2 saplings/window = 80 saplings.

2. Determine the number of saplings Mary will give away:
   - Mary will give away 1 sapling from each of the 40 windows.
   - Total saplings given away = 40 windows * 1 sapling/window = 40 saplings.

3. Calculate the number of saplings left:
   - Initial saplings received = 18 saplings.
   - Saplings given away = 40 saplings.
   - Saplings left = Initial saplings - Saplings given away = 18 saplings - 40 saplings = -22 saplings.

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Mary does not have enough saplings to give away 1 from each window. Therefore, she will be short of saplings.

The second friend rang the bell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The third friend rang the bell 10 times more than the second friend. If the fourth friend rang the bell 60 times, how many times was the bell rung in total?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let the number of times the first friend rang the bell be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).
3. The second friend rang the bell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend rang the bell \( x + \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{5}{4}x \).
4. Substituting \( x = 20 \), the second friend rang the bell \( \frac{5}{4} \times 20 = 25 \) times.
5. The third friend rang the bell 10 times more than the second friend, so the third friend rang the bell \( 25 + 10 = 35 \) times.
6. Let the number of times the fourth friend rang the bell be \( y \).
7. According to the problem, \( y = 60 \).

Now, to find the total number of times the bell was rung, we sum up the times each friend rang the bell:

Subtract the cashback from the total cost:
- Final price of the gas = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final price of the gas is $\boxed{28.00}$.",0,28
polymath-low-bn-110,"Question: To determine how many rolls of paper they would have eaten if both Marcel and Viattriz finished their portions, Marcel had 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long, and Viattriz had 2 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, what is the average number of rolls each ate?

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of rolls each person had:
- Marcel: \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \) rolls
- Viattriz: \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) rolls

Next, we find the total number of rolls eaten by both:
- Total rolls eaten: \( 42 + 48 = 90 \) rolls

Since they ate all their rolls, the average number of rolls each ate is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average number of rolls each ate is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45

When the boat in the lake turned back towards the bank, it took two liters of water every ten feet as it covered a distance of sixteen feet. It took thirty-two seconds to cover that distance. The bank was sixty-four feet away. How much water entered the boat when Julia reached the bank?

Answer:
To determine how much water entered the boat when Julia reached the bank, we need to calculate the rate at which water entered the boat and then use that rate to find the amount of water over the total distance.

1. **Rate of Water Entry:**
   - The boat takes 16 feet to enter 2 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the rate of water entry is \( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{16 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{8 \text{ feet}} \).

2. **Total Distance Covered:**
   - The total distance from the boat to the bank is 64 feet.

3. **Total Water Entered:**
   - Using the rate of water entry, the total amount of water that entered the boat over 64 feet is:
   \[
   \text{Total Water} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Total Distance} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{8 \text{ feet}} \times 64 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, when Julia reached the bank, 8 liters of water had entered the boat.

polymath-low-bn-112,"Question: In a classroom, there is a whiteboard that each of the four teachers uses when they are teaching. Each teacher reads two chapters a day and uses the whiteboard for each chapter. If the whiteboard is erased three times for each chapter, how many times is the whiteboard erased in a day?

Let's break down the problem:
- Each teacher reads 2 chapters a day.
- Each chapter uses the whiteboard 3 times.
- There are 4 teachers.

To find out how many times the whiteboard is erased in a day, we can calculate it as follows:
1. Calculate the total number of chapters read in a day: \( 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ chapters/teacher} = 8 \text{ chapters} \).
2. Calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is erased for all chapters in a day: \( 8 \text{ chapters} \times 3 \text{ erasures/chapter} = 24 \text{ erasures} \).

Therefore, the whiteboard is erased 24 times in a day.

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Ryan picked 2 flowers initially.
2. If 5 more don't bloom, then the total number of flowers will be the initial number plus the number that did bloom.

Let's assume that all 5 flowers that didn't bloom actually bloomed. This means:
- Ryan picked 2 flowers.
- 5 flowers bloomed.

So, the total number of flowers would be:
2 (picked) + 5 (bloomed) = 7 flowers

Question in English:
Jamil has 6 times more pictures from the British phone than from his phone. The maximum number of pictures from the British phone is 50 times more than the total number of birds in Jamal's photo of the roosting stork in the aviary. If Jamal has 1800 pictures from his phone, how many storks will be seen in the aviary photo of Jamal's roosting stork?

Answer:
Let's denote the number of pictures from Jamal's phone as P_J, the number of pictures from the British phone as P_B, and the number of birds in the roosting stork photo as B.

From the problem, we know:
1. P_J = 1800
2. P_B = 6 * P_J
3. B = 50 * P_J

First, calculate the number of pictures from the British phone:
P_B = 6 * 1800 = 10800

Next, calculate the number of birds in the roosting stork photo:
B = 50 * 1800 = 90000

Since the roosting stork photo in the aviary contains all the birds from both Jamal's phone and the British phone, the total number of birds in the aviary photo is:
Total birds = B = 90000

Therefore, the number of storks in the aviary photo is the same as the number of birds in the roosting stork photo, which is 90000.

After buying some sheets of wood, Sasha realizes that the price of wood sheets has increased by 50% in the past few months. Since some of the remaining wood is gone, he decides to sell the rest. He has 10 leftover boards of 2x4x10 inches, each bought for $10. He also has 5 boards of 4x4x10 inches, each bought for $16. If he sells all of them, how much profit will he make?

Answer:
First, we calculate the total cost of the leftover 2x4x10 inches boards:
10 boards * $10/board = $100

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 4x4x10 inches boards:
5 boards * $16/board = $80

The total cost of all the boards is:
$100 + $80 = $180

Now, we calculate the total selling price of the leftover 2x4x10 inches boards:
10 boards * $20/board = $200

And the total selling price of the 4x4x10 inches boards:
5 boards * $24/board = $120

The total selling price of all the boards is:
$200 + $120 = $320

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost:
$320 - $180 = $140

Therefore, Sasha will make a profit of $\\boxed{140}",140,90
polymath-low-bn-116,"Question: If she mixes both batches and uses a total of 120 units of tea, coffee beans, sugar, and water to make coffee, how much tea, coffee beans, and sugar did she use in total?

Let's solve this step by step:
1. We know the ratio of tea to coffee beans to sugar to water is 7:13:1:4.
2. The sum of the parts of the ratio is 7 + 13 + 1 + 4 = 25 parts.
3. If the total amount used is 120 units, each part of the ratio is therefore 120 ÷ 25 = 4.8 units.
4. To find the amount of tea used, we multiply the number of parts for tea (7) by the value of each part (4.8 units): 7 × 4.8 = 33.6 units.
5. To find the amount of coffee beans used, we multiply the number of parts for coffee beans (13) by the value of each part (4.8 units): 13 × 4.8 = 62.4 units.
6. To find the amount of sugar used, we multiply the number of parts for sugar (1) by the value of each part (4.8 units): 1 × 4.8 = 4.8 units.

Therefore, the total amount of tea, coffee beans, and sugar used is 33.6 + 62.4 + 4.8 = 99.8 units.

The total amount of tea, coffee beans, and sugar used is $\boxed{99.8}$.",8,42

polymath-low-bn-119,"Question: If Adrien's salary was 30% more than Layla's, and four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% compared to what Layla was earning four years ago, and both Adrien and Layla's salaries increased by the same percentage over four years, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, then how much total salary did they earn together four years later?

Let's denote Layla's salary four years ago as L. According to the information, Adrien's salary four years ago was 1.3L and four years later it was 1.4 times Layla's salary at that time, which is 1.4L. Since their salaries increased by the same percentage, let's denote this percentage increase as x. Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later can also be expressed as 1.3L * (1 + x)^4 = 1.4L.

Solving for x, we get:
\[ 1.3L \cdot (1 + x)^4 = 1.4L \]
\[ (1 + x)^4 = \frac{1.4L}{1.3L} = \frac{14}{13} \]
\[ 1 + x = \left(\frac{14}{13}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \]
\[ x = \left(\frac{14}{13}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} - 1 \]

Now, Adrien's salary four years later is 1.4L and Layla's salary four years later is L * (1 + x)^4 = 1.4L. The total salary four years later is:
\[ 1.4L + 1.4L = 2.8L \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we have:
\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23 \]

So, four years later, their total salary is:
\[ 2.8L = 2.8 \times 30769.23 \approx 86153.88 \]

To solve this, we'll break it down into two parts: the morning and the afternoon.

1. In the morning, they run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance in the morning} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]
