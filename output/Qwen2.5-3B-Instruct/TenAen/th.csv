mgsm-th-47,"Question in English: John bought more red neckties than blue neckties, two times as many. The red necktie costs 50% more than the blue necktie, which costs $200 per necktie. He bought a total of $\\boxed{600$ dollars worth of neckties.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The price of a blue necktie is $200.
2. The red necktie costs 50% more than the blue one, so its price is $200 + 0.5 * $200 = $300.
3. John bought two times as many red neckties as blue neckties. Since he bought one blue necktie for $200, he bought two red neckties for $300 each.
4. The total cost for the blue neckties is $200.
5. The total cost for the red neckties is $300 * 2 = $600.
6. Therefore, the total amount John spent on neckties is $200 + $600 = $600.",600,800
mgsm-th-48,"Question: Tracy uses one piece of wire that is 4 feet long to support a tomato plant in the garden by cutting the wire into pieces that are 6 inches each. How many pieces will she have?

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the length of each piece is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she can get:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces is $\\boxed{8}$.",8,8

Uriaah's leather bookbag is getting too heavy for him. He wants to remove 15 pounds of items. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and each toy weighs 1/2 pound. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?

To solve this, we first calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books:
\[ 30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound per comic book} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the bookbag is 15 pounds, so the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:
\[ 15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys that need to be removed is:

mgsm-th-57,"Question: A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A truck carrying boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will cross the bridge if the total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. How many boxes at most can the truck carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Let's denote the number of boxes the truck can carry as $x$. The total weight of the boxes is $15x$ pounds. The total weight of the driver, the empty truck, and the boxes is $3755 + 15x$ pounds. This total weight must be less than or equal to the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. Therefore, we have the inequality:

\[3755 + 15x \leq 5000\]

Subtract 3755 from both sides of the inequality:

\[15x \leq 1245\]

Divide both sides by 15:

\[x \leq \frac{1245}{15} = 83\]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry is 83.

If Marcy worked for the same company for 40 years and would receive an annual pension of $50,000 starting from the year 20, she would be entitled to a 5% annual return on the above amount from that point onward. If she leaves after completing 30 years of service, how much will she receive in annual pension?

Answer:
If Marcy leaves after 30 years of service, she will be entitled to receive the annual pension based on the $50,000 amount for 10 years (from year 20 to year 30). The calculation for the annual pension amount is as follows:

1. Calculate the present value of the $50,000 pension for 10 years at a 5% discount rate.
2. The formula for the present value of an annuity is: 
\[ PV = \frac{PMT}{r} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}\right) \]
where \(PMT\) is the annual payment, \(r\) is the interest rate, and \(n\) is the number of periods.

Plugging in the values:
\[ PMT = 50,000 \]
\[ r = 0.05 \]
\[ n = 10 \]

\[ PV = \frac{50,000}{0.05} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + 0.05)^{10}}\right) \]
\[ PV = 1,000,000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{1.62889}\right) \]
\[ PV = 1,000,000 \left(1 - 0.61391\right) \]
\[ PV = 1,000,000 \times 0.38609 \]
\[ PV = 386,090 \]

mgsm-th-63,"Question: Alyona signed up for a streaming service that costs $140 per month. If the streaming company charges the mentioned amount for the first half of the year, and then charges 10% less for the second half of the year, calculate the total amount Alyona paid for the streaming service in a year.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:
- There are 6 months in a half-year.
- The cost per month is $140.
- Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is \(6 \times 140 = 840\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
- The cost per month for the second half is 10% less than the original $140.
- So, the reduced cost per month is \(140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126\) dollars.
- Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is \(6 \times 126 = 756\) dollars.

Finally, let's add the costs for both halves of the year to get the total amount Alyona paid:
- Total cost = cost for the first half + cost for the second half = \(840 + 756 = 1596\) dollars.

The total amount Alyona paid for the streaming service in a year is \\boxed{1596}.",1596,1596

If he builds a sandcastle with 4 layers, where the topmost layer has an area of 16 square feet, what is the average area of each layer in square feet?

Let's denote the area of the topmost layer as $A_1 = 16$ square feet. Since each subsequent layer has an area that is half a square foot less than the layer below it, we can denote the areas of the four layers as follows:

- $A_1 = 16$ square feet
- $A_2 = A_1 - 0.5 = 16 - 0.5 = 15.5$ square feet
- $A_3 = A_2 - 0.5 = 15.5 - 0.5 = 15$ square feet
- $A_4 = A_3 - 0.5 = 15 - 0.5 = 14.5$ square feet

To find the average area of each layer, we sum the areas of all four layers and divide by 4:

\[
\text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{16 + 15.5 + 15 + 14.5}{4} = \frac{61}{4} = 15.25

To solve this, we need to determine the cheaper price per flower and then calculate the savings.

1. Calculate the price per flower for each option:
   - For 3 flowers for $2.50, the price per flower is $2.50 / 3 ≈ $0.8333.
   - For 2 flowers for $1, the price per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50.

2. Determine which price is cheaper:
   - $0.50 is cheaper than $0.8333.

3. Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the cheaper price:
   - 18 flowers at $0.50 each = 18 * $0.50 = $9.00.

4. Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the more expensive price:
   - 18 flowers at $2.50 / 3 each = 18 * ($2.50 / 3) = 18 * $0.8333 = $15.00.

- Amy (A) = unknown
- Jackson (J) = 10 years
- Cole (C) = unknown
- James (M) = 10 years

From the information given:
1. Amy is older than Jackson by 5 years: \( A = J + 5 \)

Question: Lee can run 400 meters 2 seconds faster than Gerald, but Gerald changes his eating habits to lose weight, which increases his speed by 10%. If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, how many seconds will it take for Gerald, after adjusting his eating habits, to run 400 meters.

Answer:
To solve this, we first need to determine Gerald's original speed before he adjusted his eating habits. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we calculate Gerald's new speed after adjusting his eating habits. Since his speed increases by 10%, his new speed is 110% of his original speed. To find the new time, we use the relationship between speed, distance, and time. The distance (400 meters) remains constant, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Original speed} \times \text{Original time} = \text{New speed} \times \text{New time} \]

Let's denote Gerald's original speed as \( v \). Then his new speed is \( 1.1v \). Since the original time is 40 seconds and the distance is 400 meters, we can find the new time \( t \) as follows:

\[ v \times 40 = 1.1v \times t \]

We can cancel \( v \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 40 = 1.1t \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{40}{1.1} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald, after adjusting his eating habits, will be able to run 400 meters in approximately 36.36 seconds.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing up the house:
\[ \text{Cost of fixing up} = \$50,000 \]

Next, we calculate the increase in value due to the repairs:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times \$80,000 \]
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 1.5 \times \$80,000 \]
\[ \text{Increase in value} = \$120,000 \]

Now, we add the cost of fixing up to the increase in value to find the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total selling price} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 \]
\[ \text{Total selling price} = \$200,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the total cost (cost of the house plus the cost of fixing up) from the total selling price to find the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$200,000 - (\$80,000 + \$50,000) \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it takes for the total profit to cover the initial cost of planting the trees.

4. **Calculate the number of years to break even:**
   - Initial cost for one tree = $90.
   - Annual profit per tree = $7.5.
   - Number of years to break even = Initial cost / Annual profit
   - Number of years to break even = \$90 / \$7.5 = 12 years.

Therefore, Carlos will start making a profit from the lemon trees in \(\boxed{12}\) years.",12,13
mgsm-th-13,"Question: Melanie is a home salesperson. She sells one-third of the green house vacuum cleaners, sells 2 red house vacuum cleaners, and half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 more vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at first?

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as \( x \).

1. Melanie sells one-third of the green house vacuum cleaners, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
2. She then sells 2 red vacuum cleaners.
3. The remaining number of vacuum cleaners after selling the green and red ones is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She sells half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).
5. After selling the orange house vacuum cleaners, she has 5 more vacuum cleaners left, so the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = 5
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6

Therefore, Melanie initially had 18 vacuum cleaners. The final number is $\\boxed{18}$.",18,18
mgsm-th-14,"Question: In a dance class with 20 students, 20% take contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining students take jazz dance, and the rest take hip-hop dance. What percentage of the total students take hip-hop dance?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Total number of students = 20
2. Students taking contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
3. Remaining students after contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16 students
4. Students taking jazz dance = 25% of remaining students = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students
5. Remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students
6. These remaining students are taking hip-hop dance.

So, the number of students taking hip-hop dance is 12 out of 20 total students.

To find the percentage:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of students taking hip-hop dance is $\\boxed{60}$.",60,60

mgsm-th-19,"Question: Marsia hikes a 12-mile trail. She completes the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the remaining distance, at what speed (in miles per hour) must she hike the remaining distance?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculate the total distance and the time already spent:**
   - Total distance: 12 miles
   - Distance already covered: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Time already spent: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
   - Remaining distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining time: 2 hours (since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the remaining distance)

2. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Here, the average speed is given as 4 miles per hour, and the remaining time is 2 hours.
   - Let \( v \) be the required speed for the remaining distance.
   - The total distance covered in the remaining time should be 6 miles.
   - Therefore, \( v \times 2 = 6 \).

3. **Solve for \( v \):**
   \[
   v \times 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   v = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ miles per hour}

mgsm-th-20,"Question: I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is made up of water in two-thirds, and I want to mix it into 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is made up of water in five-thirds. While pouring the orange juice, I accidentally spill 1 liter of orange juice. How many liters of the fruit drink mixture will I have left, if the total mixture is 24 liters?

Let's calculate the amount of water in the orange juice and pineapple juice first:

- Water in 10 liters of orange juice = $\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3}$ liters
- Water in 15 liters of pineapple juice = $\frac{5}{3} \times 15 = 25$ liters

After spilling 1 liter of orange juice, the amount of orange juice left is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange juice is:

- Water in 9 liters of orange juice = $\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6$ liters

Now, add the water from the remaining orange juice and the pineapple juice:

- Total water = $6 + 25 = 31$ liters

Since we are mixing these into a total of 24 liters of fruit drink mixture, the amount of the mixture that will be left is:

- Remaining mixture = $24 - 31 = -7$ liters

But since we can't have a negative amount of mixture, it means we have more than 24 liters of mixture. The excess amount is:

- Excess mixture = $31 - 24 = 7$ liters

So, the number of liters of the fruit drink mixture that will be left is $\boxed{7}$.",7,15

Answer in English: To solve this, we first need to determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23 and Samantha is currently 31 years old, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:

\[ \text{Raymond's current age} = \text{Samantha's current age} + 6 = 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. Therefore, the number of years since Raymond had his son is:

\[ \text{Years since Raymond had his son} = \text{Raymond's current age} - 23 = 37 - 23 = 14 \text{ years} \]

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items other than the pizza:
- Cost of chicken dish = $12
- Cost of 5 packs of milk = 5 * $3 = $15
- Cost of 4 apples = 4 * $1.50 = $6

Total cost of chicken dish, milk, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, subtract this amount from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizza:
- Total amount paid = $50
- Cost of chicken dish, milk, and apples = $33
- Cost of pizza = $50 - $33 = $17

Since each pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of pizzas Marie ordered by dividing the total cost of the pizza by the cost per pizza:
- Number of pizzas = $17 / $8.50 = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two high heels:
\[ \text{Cost of first high heel pair} = \$33 \]
\[ \text{Cost of second high heel pair} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of high heels} = \$33 + \$66 = \$99 \]

Next, we know that the total cost of the two high heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots:

After the event, when guests had taken their own servings, there were still 14 pieces left. How many pieces did the guests take?

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Mrs. Johnson baked 5 apple pies, each sliced into 8 pieces.
2. Total number of apple pie pieces initially = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces.
3. After the event, there were 14 pieces left.

mgsm-th-43,"Question: Given that a serving of fried potatoes provides 250 calories per serving and a 300-gram serving contains 5 servings, how many grams of fried potatoes can you consume in a day with a daily calorie goal of 2000 calories, if you have already consumed 1800 calories?

First, let's find out how many calories are in a 300-gram serving of potatoes:
- 1 serving = 250 calories
- 5 servings = 5 * 250 = 1250 calories

So, a 300-gram serving of potatoes provides 1250 calories.

Next, let's determine how many calories are left for the day:
- Daily calorie goal = 2000 calories
- Calories already consumed = 1800 calories
- Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, we need to find out how many grams of potatoes can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
- 1250 calories in 300 grams
- To find out how many grams are in 200 calories, we use the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}}
  \]
  Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{300 \times 200}{1250} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \text{ grams}
  \]

Therefore, the number of grams of fried potatoes you can consume is \(\boxed{48}\).",48,48

To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue from selling 20 candles.

- Cost of beeswax and wick for 20 candles: $10.00
- Revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each: 20 * $2.00 = $40.00

Net profit = Revenue - Cost = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

mgsm-th-45,"Question: Meredith is an independent blogger who writes about health and sends articles to her clients daily. It takes her an average of 4 hours to research and write one blog post. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and wrote more than 2/5 of that on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles over these three days.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Articles**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. **Tuesday's Articles**: She wrote more than 2/5 of the articles she wrote on Monday. 
   - 2/5 of 5 is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \).
   - So, she wrote more than 2 articles on Tuesday, which means she wrote at least 3 articles.
3. **Wednesday's Articles**: She wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday.
   - If she wrote 3 articles on Tuesday, then on Wednesday she wrote \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) articles.
   - If she wrote 4 articles on Tuesday, then on Wednesday she wrote \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) articles.
   - Since the problem states she wrote more than 2/5 of the Monday's articles, the minimum number of articles on Tuesday is 3, and thus the minimum number of articles on Wednesday is 6.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 3 articles
- Wednesday: 6 articles

Total articles = 5 + 3 + 6 = 14 articles.

Each article takes 4 hours to write, so the total number of hours spent writing is:
\[ 14 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 56 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours she spent writing articles over these three days is \\boxed{56}.",56,104
mgsm-th-46,"Question: Candice picked 80 sheets of postcards and put them in her handbag before going to work at the coffee shop. On her way, she stopped at a store and bought a bundle of postcards. During her work, she stuck one sheet of postcards on each of 220 cups of coffee. If she has 23 sheets of postcards left, how many sheets of postcards did she buy in total?

Let's denote the total number of postcards Candice bought as \( x \).

1. She initially had 80 sheets.
2. She bought an additional bundle of postcards, which we'll call \( y \) sheets.
3. She used 220 sheets for the coffee cups.
4. She has 23 sheets left.

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + y - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ y - 220 + 80 = 23 \]
\[ y - 140 = 23 \]
\[ y = 23 + 140 \]
\[ y = 163 \]

Therefore, she bought a bundle of 163 sheets of postcards.

mgsm-th-94,"Question: In a residential area, the total number of dogs and cats combined is more than twice the number of rabbits. If there are twice as many cats as dogs, and there are 60 dogs, how many animals are there in total in this area?

Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

From the problem, we know:
1. D = 60 (number of dogs)
2. C = 2D (number of cats is twice the number of dogs)
3. D + C + R > 2D (the total number of dogs and cats combined is more than twice the number of rabbits)

Substituting the value of D into the equations:
C = 2 * 60 = 120 (number of cats)

Now, we need to find the number of rabbits:
D + C + R > 2D
60 + 120 + R > 2 * 60
180 + R > 120
R > 120 - 180
R > -60

Since the number of rabbits cannot be negative, the smallest possible number of rabbits is 0. However, the problem states that the total number of dogs and cats combined is more than twice the number of rabbits, which implies there must be at least one rabbit.

Therefore, the minimum number of rabbits is 1:
R = 1

Now we can find the total number of animals:
Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 1 = 181

The total number of animals in the area is $\\boxed{181}$.",181,348

mgsm-th-97,"Question: When Fred brings canned tomatoes to make a sauce, the tomatoes will reduce to half their original volume. Each can she uses has a volume of 16 ounces and each can contains three tomatoes. How many tomatoes did Fred use in total for her latest tomato sauce which has a volume of 32 ounces?

To solve the problem, we first determine the number of tomatoes used in the 32 ounces of sauce. Since each tomato reduces to half its original volume, we can think of the volume reduction as a factor of 2 in terms of the number of tomatoes used. 

Given that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, we can infer that the original volume of tomatoes used (before reduction) must be 64 ounces (since 32 ounces is half of 64 ounces). This means Fred used 64/16 = 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Fred used is $\\boxed{12}$.",12,12

If there were initially 30 cars on the highway, how many cars moved past the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

Let's denote the number of cars that moved past the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

From the problem, we know:
- 5 cars used the exit.
- 20 cars moved past in the last 15 minutes.
- The total number of cars initially was 30.

So, the equation representing the total number of cars that moved past the traffic jam is:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Solving for x:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that moved past the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

How many pots will Mary have left?

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of pots she has:
- Pots from the nursery: 18
- Pots already at her house: 40 windows * 2 pots/window = 80 pots

Total pots Mary has: 18 + 80 = 98 pots

Next, we calculate the number of pots she will give away:
- Pots to give to friends and family: 40 pots

The second friend rings the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The third friend rings the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend. If the fourth friend rings the doorbell 60 times, how many times has the doorbell been rung in total?

To solve this, let's denote the number of times the first friend rings the doorbell as \( F_1 \), the second friend as \( F_2 \), the third friend as \( F_3 \), and the fourth friend as \( F_4 \).

Given:
- \( F_1 = 20 \)

How much water will have entered the boat when Julia reaches the shore?

To solve this, we need to determine the total time Julia spends paddling and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on her paddling speed.

1. Julia paddles for 20 feet, which takes her 6.5 seconds.

mgsm-th-118,"Question: The customs official at the SeaSide Free Port's main port counted 2 cargo containers that each contain 5 vehicles of imported vehicles. The next day, more cargo containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 vehicles. How many cargo containers were brought in on the second day if each cargo container has 5 vehicles?

Let's break down the problem:
- On the first day, there were 2 cargo containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
- Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day was \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles.
- On the second day, the total number of vehicles increased to 30.

Let \(x\) be the number of cargo containers brought in on the second day. Each cargo container contains 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles brought in on the second day is \(5x\).

The equation representing the total number of vehicles after the second day is:
\[10 + 5x = 30\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[5x = 30 - 10\]
\[5x = 20\]
\[x = 4\]

Therefore, on the second day, 4 cargo containers were brought in.

mgsm-th-119,"Question: Adrian's total salary is 30% more than Letitia's total salary. Four years later, Adrian's salary increases, and he earns 40% more than what he earned four years ago. If Adrian and Letitia's salaries increase at the same rate and Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount both earned four years later.

Let's start by calculating Adrian's salary four years later. If Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago and his salary increased by 40%, his new salary is:
\[ 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

Now, we need to determine Letitia's salary four years ago. Let's denote Letitia's salary four years ago as \( L \). According to the problem, Adrian's salary four years ago was 30% less than Letitia's salary four years ago. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 40,000 = L - 0.30L = 0.70L \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{0.70} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{7} = \frac{400,000}{7} \approx 57,142.86 \]

Four years later, Letitia's salary will also increase by 40%. Thus, her new salary will be:
\[ 57,142.86 + 0.40 \times 57,142.86 = 57,142.86 + 22,857.14 = 80,000 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount both earned four years later:
\[ 56,000 + 80,000 = 136,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount both earned four years later is:

Let's break it down:
1. On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each night, so 8 - 2 = 6 hours per night.
3. For Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she slept 6 + 6 = 12 hours.
4. For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than those two nights combined, so 12 + 1 = 13 hours per night.

She stamps one out of every three of the letters that need stamping. If there are now 30 letters in the already stamped pile, how many letters were in that pile when Jennifer started?

Let's denote the number of letters Jennifer started with as \( x \).

Given that she stamps one out of every three letters that need stamping, it means that for every 3 letters, 1 is stamped. Therefore, the ratio of letters stamped to letters that need stamping is 1:2.

If there are 30 letters already stamped, then the number of letters that need to be stamped is \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \). This matches the number of letters that Jennifer started with, since the total number of letters (both stamped and not stamped) is 60.

Since the 60 letters include both those that need to be stamped and those that are already stamped, and we know there are 30 letters already stamped, the number of letters Jennifer started with is the sum of the letters that need to be stamped and the letters that are already stamped.

Therefore, \( x = 60 \).

If one sweet pepper costs $15, how much money will he need to pay in total?

To solve this, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit based on the given information and then sum up the total cost.

1. **Sweet Pepper Cost**: Given as $15 per pepper.
2. **Watermelon Cost**: Since one watermelon costs three times as much as one sweet pepper, the cost of one watermelon is:

Doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour for their services, and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour for treatment. How much profit does the hospital make from these patients?

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- Each patient receives 24 minutes of treatment, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours of treatment.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour, so for 0.4 hours, the hospital earns $200 * 0.4 = $80 per patient.
- With 500 patients per day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000 per day.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the treatment:
- Each patient receives 24 minutes of treatment, which is 0.4 hours of treatment.
- Doctors charge $150 per hour, so for 0.4 hours, the doctor earns $150 * 0.4 = $60 per patient.
- With 500 patients per day, the total cost for doctors is $60 * 500 = $30,000 per day.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- The total revenue is $40,000 per day.
- The total cost is $30,000 per day.
- The profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000 per day.

Su lives in an area that is lively. One weekend, Su's neighbors decided to play a trick on Su. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 plastic flamingos of pink color in front of Su's house. On Saturday morning, one-third of the pink flamingos were taken back to be painted white, and the newly painted white flamingos were returned to Su's front yard. Then on Sunday morning, they added another 18 plastic pink flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more plastic pink flamingos are outside compared to the plastic white flamingos?

Answer:
To determine how many more plastic pink flamingos are outside compared to the plastic white flamingos at noon on Sunday, let's break down the information:

1. Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
2. One-third of the pink flamingos (18 / 3 = 6) were painted white and returned to the collection.
3. Therefore, the number of pink flamingos remaining in the collection is 18 - 6 = 12.
4. On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added to the collection.
5. So, the total number of pink flamingos at noon on Sunday is 12 + 18 = 30.
6. There were no white flamingos added to the collection after being painted white.
7. Thus, there are 30 pink flamingos and 0 white flamingos at noon on Sunday.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 - 0 = 30 more plastic pink flamingos outside compared to the plastic white flamingos.

A pen costs the same as the total cost of a pencil and a piece of eraser. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. How much will 8 pens cost?

To solve the problem, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. Given that a pen costs the same as the total cost of a pencil and an eraser, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

Cost of one pen = Cost of one pencil + Cost of one eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now, to find the total cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Total cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
Total cost of 8 pens = $1.50 × 8
Total cost of 8 pens = $12.00

If he earns $2000 per week consistently throughout the year and he receives the prize on the first day of the year, how much money did he earn in total that year? 

Answer: First, we calculate the total earnings from his weekly salary. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we calculate the increase in his monthly salary due to the 5% increase. His original monthly salary is $2000, so the increase is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]
Thus, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings from his new monthly salary for the entire year:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool now as \( S \) and the amount of water in the large pool now as \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools were leaking at 4 gallons per minute, four minutes ago, the large pool had \( L + 4 \times 4 = L + 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, \( L + 16 = 2(S + 16) \).
2. Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so \( L = 4S \).

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation:
\[ L + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ L + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ L = 2S + 16 \]

From the second equation:
\[ L = 4S \]

Now we can set the two expressions for \( L \) equal to each other:
\[ 4S = 2S + 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]

2. Selin uses 90 liters of water to water her garden. 
   - Remaining water in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters.
3. After using the water, Selin can collect twice as much rainwater as the remaining water.
   - Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters.
4. The total water in the tank now is the remaining water plus the collected rainwater.
   - Total water in the tank = 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Therefore, the number of liters of water in the tank is $\\boxed{90}$.",90,90
mgsm-th-222,"Translation: Andy planted 90 tulips and planted fewer dianthuses than tulips by 40. How many flowers did he plant in total?

To solve this, we first determine the number of dianthuses planted. Since he planted 40 fewer dianthuses than tulips, and he planted 90 tulips, we can calculate the number of dianthuses as follows:

Number of dianthuses = Number of tulips - 40
Number of dianthuses = 90 - 40
Number of dianthuses = 50

Now, we add the number of tulips and dianthuses to find the total number of flowers planted:

Total number of flowers = Number of tulips + Number of dianthuses
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy planted is $\\boxed{140}$.",140,140

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

Then, we add the amounts spent in both years to get the total:
$15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together.

For Carlos:
Cost = $30/hour * 3 hours = $90

For Benji:
Cost = $18/hour * 5 hours = $90

Total cost = Carlos's cost + Benji's cost = $90 + $90 = $180

mgsm-th-226,"Question: James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards. If he loses 8 water cards and buys 14 grass cards, what is the percentage chance he will draw a water card (round to the nearest whole number)?

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:
- Initial water cards: 40
- Lost water cards: 8
- Remaining water cards: 40 - 8 = 32
- Initial grass cards: 20
- Bought grass cards: 14
- Total grass cards: 20 + 14 = 34
- Initial fire cards: 30
- Total cards: 32 (water) + 34 (grass) + 30 (fire) = 96

The probability of drawing a water card is the number of water cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \]

To convert this probability to a percentage and round to the nearest whole number:
\[ 0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that James will draw a water card is $\\boxed{33}$.",33,33

He added $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and $0.25 for each of two additional sauces. He decided to upgrade his meal by an additional $3.00, which includes fries and a drink. He has a $5.00 gift card to use at checkout. How much more does he need to pay?

First, let's calculate the total cost of the meal before using the gift card:
- Base entree: $6.50
- Meat: $2.00
- Cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Two sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Total cost before upgrade and gift card: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, add the upgrade cost:
- Upgrade: $3.00

Total cost after upgrade: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Subtract the value of the gift card:
- Gift card: $5.00

Amount to be paid after using the gift card: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad needs to pay an additional $9.00.

To solve this, first determine how many pieces they can assemble per minute together:
- Calvin assembles 4 pieces per minute.
- His mother assembles 8 pieces per minute (twice as many as Calvin).

Together, they can assemble \(4 + 8 = 12\) pieces per minute.

Next, calculate the total time required to assemble 360 pieces:
- Since they can assemble 12 pieces per minute, the total time in minutes is \(360 \div 12 = 30\) minutes.

Finally, convert the time from minutes to hours:

To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:** 
\[ 12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$240,000 \]

2. **Tax on the cars:**

mgsm-th-232,"Question: Dix went to the farm to pick apples and found more than half of the insects in the garden were other than ants. If there are 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.

Let's denote the total number of insects in the garden as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of ants (50) is more than half of the total number of insects. This can be expressed as:
\[ 50 > \frac{x}{2} \]

To find the total number of insects, we can rearrange the inequality:
\[ 100 > x \]
\[ x < 100 \]

Since the number of ants (50) is more than half of the total number of insects, the smallest integer greater than half of 50 is 26 (because 50 is more than 25 but less than 50). Therefore, the total number of insects must be more than 25 but less than 100. The smallest integer that satisfies this condition is 26.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

2. Aaron has more gems than half of Raymonde's gems, so Aaron has more than 40 / 2 = 20 gems.
3. Ban has fewer gems than Aaron by 2, so if we let the number of gems Ban has be B, then Aaron has B + 2 gems.

Since Aaron has more than 20 gems and Ban has fewer gems than Aaron by 2, the minimum number of gems Aaron can have is 21. Therefore, Ban has 21 - 2 = 19 gems.

To solve this, we first calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes. Since he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than in the first, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points from both 20-minute periods to find the total points scored:

Denae can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can jump walk at a speed that is half of her running speed. If she can jump walk at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking?

Answer:
First, let's determine the running speed of Denae. Since her walking speed is 3 miles per hour and her running speed is four times faster, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we calculate the time she spends running and walking in six hours. One-third of the time is spent running, and two-thirds of the time is spent walking:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 12 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 24 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances together to find the total distance she can travel:

First, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day:
2000 calories (daily goal) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories (remaining)

Next, we calculate how many calories come from one gram of fried potatoes:
Since 5 servings (300 grams) provide 250 * 5 = 1250 calories, one serving (250 calories) is 300 / 5 = 60 grams.

Now, we determine how many grams of fried potatoes can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue from selling 20 candles and subtract the total cost of the materials used to make those candles.

- Revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each: $2.00 * 20 = $40.00
- Cost of materials for 20 candles: Since one pound of bee wax with wick costs $10.00 and makes 10 candles, the cost for one candle is $10.00 / 10 = $1.00. Therefore, the cost for 20 candles is $1.00 * 20 = $20.00

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles over these three days.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday:
   - Number of articles on Monday = 5
   - Number of articles on Tuesday > 2/5 * 5 = 2
   - Since the number of articles must be a whole number, the minimum number of articles on Tuesday is 3.

2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday:
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = 2 * Number of articles on Tuesday = 2 * 3 = 6

To solve this, first, we need to find the cost of one red necktie. Since the red necktie costs 50% more than the blue necktie, which costs $40, the cost of one red necktie is:
\[ 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

John paid $200 for blue neckties, so the number of blue neckties he bought is:

To solve this, we first calculate the distance Tom traveled during the outbound trip. The time he spent sailing was from 13:00 to 16:00, which is 3 hours. At a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance he covered is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

For the return trip, Tom travels the same 30 miles but at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time it takes to return can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

For truck tires, the repairman charges $60 per tire, and for car tires, he charges $40 per tire. On Thursday, he repaired 6 tires of trucks and 4 tires of cars. On Friday, he repaired 12 tires of cars and no truck tires. On which day did the repairman earn more money and by how much in dollars?

To solve this, we calculate the earnings for each day:

Thursday:
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total earnings on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Friday:
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60/tire = $0
- Total earnings on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Comparing the earnings:
- Thursday earnings: $520
- Friday earnings: $480

The repairman earned $520 - $480 = $40 more on Thursday.

polymath-low-th-54,"Question: While the Dearly Fires were driving back home with seven cats they had adopted from the local animal shelter, their mother called to say that the two cats at home had just had kittens. Her mother said that the first cat named Patch had three times as many kittens as the adopted cats, and the second cat named Trixie had 12 kittens. Now, how many kittens do the Dearly Fires have in total.

To solve this, let's denote the number of adopted cats as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 7 \).

The first cat (Patch) had three times as many kittens as the adopted cats, so the number of Patch's kittens is \( 3x = 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

The second cat (Trixie) had 12 kittens.

Therefore, the total number of kittens is the sum of the adopted cats' kittens, Patch's kittens, and Trixie's kittens:

polymath-low-th-58,"Question: Stephen ordered groceries online, and the total amount was $40.00. Since he ordered through a delivery service, the service fee was 25% of the total amount, and the delivery fee was $3.00. After adding the additional fees, he also added a tip of $4.00. What is the total amount of groceries Stephen ordered in dollars?

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the service fee:**
   - The service fee is 25% of the total amount.
   - Service fee = 25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00

2. **Calculate the total amount including the service fee:**
   - Total amount including service fee = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

3. **Add the delivery fee:**
   - Delivery fee = $3.00
   - Total amount including service fee and delivery fee = $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

4. **Add the tip:**
   - Tip = $4.00
   - Total amount including service fee, delivery fee, and tip = $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

Therefore, the total amount of groceries Stephen ordered is $57.00.

If Marcy worked for the same company for 40 years and would receive an annual pension of $50,000 starting from the year 20, she would be entitled to a pension of 5% of the annual amount mentioned above starting from the year 20. If she leaves the company after completing 30 years, how much will she receive in annual pension?

Answer:
If Marcy leaves the company after 30 years, she will have received the $50,000 pension for 10 years. To calculate her pension at that time, we need to find the future value of this annuity.

The formula for the future value of an annuity is:
\[ FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \]
where:
- \( FV \) is the future value of the annuity,
- \( P \) is the annual payment ($50,000),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of periods (10 years).

Plugging in the values:
\[ FV = 50,000 \times \frac{(1 + 0.05)^{10} - 1}{0.05} \]
\[ FV = 50,000 \times \frac{(1.05)^{10} - 1}{0.05} \]
\[ FV = 50,000 \times \frac{1.628894626777442 - 1}{0.05} \]
\[ FV = 50,000 \times \frac{0.628894626777442}{0.05} \]
\[ FV = 50,000 \times 12.57789253554884 \]
\[ FV = 628,894.626777442 \]

Therefore, if Marcy leaves the company after 30 years, she will have a pension of approximately $628,894.63.

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Let the number of rubies be \( r \).
2. According to the problem, \( r < 35 \).
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so the number of emeralds is \( 2r \).
4. The total number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds is \( 175 + r + 2r = 175 + 3r \).

To find the total number of stones, we need to determine the maximum possible value for \( r \) (which is less than 35). Let's assume \( r = 34 \) (the largest integer less than 35):
\[ 175 + 3r = 175 + 3 \times 34 = 175 + 102 = 277 \]

To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to calculate her earnings for weekdays and Saturdays separately and then add them together.

For weekdays:
- She teaches 5 classes per day.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She earns $15.00 per student.

So, for one weekday:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = 5 \times 15 \times 15 = 1125 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Since she teaches weekdays 5 days a week:
\[ 1125 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 5625 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For Saturdays:
- She teaches 8 classes.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She earns $15.00 per student.

So, for one Saturday:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = 8 \times 15 \times 15 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

If he builds a sandcastle with 4 layers, with the top layer being 16 square feet, what is the average space of each layer in square feet?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the top layer is 16 square feet.

polymath-low-th-78,"Translation: Vincent can buy a bunch of 3 flowers for $2.50 or a bunch of 2 flowers for $1. If he buys 18 flowers at the cheaper price, how much money will he save?

To solve this, we need to determine the cheaper price per flower and then calculate the savings.

1. Calculate the price per flower for each option:
   - For 3 flowers at $2.50, the price per flower is $2.50 / 3 ≈ $0.83.
   - For 2 flowers at $1, the price per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50.

2. Determine the cheaper price per flower:
   - The cheaper price per flower is $0.50.

3. Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the cheaper price:
   - Total cost = 18 flowers * $0.50/flower = $9.00.

4. Calculate the total cost if he buys 3 flowers at a time:
   - Number of bunches needed = 18 flowers / 3 flowers/bunch = 6 bunches.
   - Total cost = 6 bunches * $2.50/bunch = $15.00.

5. Calculate the savings:
   - Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Vincent will save $\\boxed{6}$.",6,6

After the meeting, 30% of the students leave the building through entrance A. The remaining students, 3/5 of them use exit B, and the rest use exit C. Calculate the number of students who left the hall through exit C.

Let's break it down step by step:
1. Calculate the number of students who left through entrance A:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \text{ students}

James has more candies than Robert by 6 pieces, while John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?

Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R. According to the information given, John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has 2R candies. We know John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

2R = 54

Solving for R:

R = 54 / 2
R = 27

So Robert has 27 candies. Now, we know James has 6 fewer candies than Robert, so James has:

R - 6 = 27 - 6 = 21 candies

Each of the remaining people sends him 2 letters per week, each letter being 5 pages long. He writes back with a friendly reply, which takes 1 page per 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing per week?

First, let's calculate the total number of people Mike is still friends with:
- Initially, he was friends with 5 people.
- He stopped being friends with 2 of them.
- Therefore, the number of remaining friends is 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Next, we calculate the total number of pages he receives per week:
- Each of the 3 remaining friends sends 2 letters per week.
- Each letter is 5 pages long.
- Therefore, the total number of pages received per week is 3 friends * 2 letters/friend * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week:
- He writes back with 1 page per 6 minutes.
- Therefore, the total number of pages he writes per week is 30 pages.

Next, we calculate the total time he spends writing per week:
- He writes 30 pages, and it takes 6 minutes to write 1 page.
- Therefore, the total time spent writing per week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Let's calculate the total minutes Jason has already used:
- Minutes spent calling his boss: 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes
- Minutes spent calling other people: 300 minutes

Total minutes used = 450 + 300 = 750 minutes

Then, Kobbi takes fewer than Cly by 3 French fries from Griffin. If at the end Griffin has 27 French fries, how many French fries did Ginger give to Griffin?

Let's break down the information:
- Griffin starts with 24 fries.
- Cly takes 5 fries.
- Billie takes twice as many as Cly, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
- Kobbi takes 3 fries less than Cly, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
- Griffin ends up with 27 fries.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x.

Initial number of fries Griffin has: 24
Fries taken by Cly: 5
Fries taken by Billie: 10
Fries taken by Kobbi: 2
Fries Griffin ends up with: 27

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ 24 - 5 - 10 - 2 + x = 27 \]

Solving for x:

After the shoot, the makeup artist reduces her price by 10% due to the amount of work done. How much does the Chinese actress pay in total?

First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on the makeup for the movie:
- Hours per day: 6
- Days per week: 4
- Weeks of production: 5

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:
- Hourly rate: $250
- Total hours: 120

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:
- Discount rate: 10%

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:
- Total cost before discount: $30,000

Answer:
First, let's calculate the number of cookies Suken ate on Monday and Tuesday:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies, so Suken ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies, so Suken ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
- Suken ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.
- Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Each cookie provides 200 calories, so we calculate the total calories each of them consumed:
- Suken consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.
- Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses and then subtract that from the total number of eggs laid to find out how many eggs are left to sell.

1. Total eggs laid by the goose per day = 16
2. Eggs eaten for breakfast per day = 3
3. Eggs used to make muffins per day = 4

Eggs used per day = Eggs eaten for breakfast + Eggs used for muffins
Eggs used per day = 3 + 4 = 7

Eggs left to sell per day = Total eggs laid - Eggs used
Eggs left to sell per day = 16 - 7 = 9

Janet sells the remaining eggs at $2 each.

Daily earnings from the farmer's market = Eggs left to sell per day × Price per egg
Daily earnings from the farmer's market = 9 × $2 = $18

Therefore, Janet will earn $18 from the farmer's market each day.

First, we need to find the total value of the house after the repairs. The increase in value is 150% of $50,000, which is:
\[ 150\% \times 50,000 = 1.5 \times 50,000 = 75,000 \]

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is:
\[ 80,000 + 75,000 = 155,000 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price plus repair cost) from the total value of the house:
\[ 155,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 155,000 - 130,000 = 25,000 \]

If Wendy has a total of 20 chickens in her coop, how many cups of feed will she need to feed the chickens in the last meal of the day?

Let's calculate the total amount of feed required for the chickens in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, each of the 20 chickens gets 15 cups, so the total for the morning is \(20 \times 15 = 300\) cups.
- In the afternoon, each of the 20 chickens gets 25 cups, so the total for the afternoon is \(20 \times 25 = 500\) cups.

Adding the morning and afternoon totals gives us the total feed for the first two meals:
\[300 + 500 = 800 \text{ cups}\]

Since there are 20 chickens in total, the amount of feed needed for the last meal is:
\[20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups}\]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{3x - x - 6}{3} \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x - 6}{3} \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ \frac{3x - 2x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

polymath-low-th-15,"Question: A merchant must choose between two plans: buying jewelry worth $5,000 or electronics equipment worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% and the electronics market will increase by 1.2% within the same month. If the merchant wants to choose the plan that yields the highest profit within the month, how much profit in dollars will the merchant make?

To find the profit from each plan, we need to calculate the increase in value for each item.

For jewelry:
Increase = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

For electronics:
Increase = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

The profit from the jewelry plan is $125 and the profit from the electronics plan is $96. Therefore, the merchant will make a profit of $125 from the jewelry plan.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
   - Time for first 4 miles: 1 hour
   - Time for next 2 miles: 1 hour
   - Total time so far: 1 + 1 = 2 hours

2. Let \( x \) be the speed (in miles per hour) Marissa needs to hike the remaining 6 miles to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

3. The total distance for the hike is 12 miles, and the total time should be 3 hours (since the average speed is 4 miles per hour for 12 miles).

4. The time taken for the remaining 6 miles at speed \( x \) is \( \frac{6}{x} \) hours.

5. The total time for the entire hike is the sum of the time already spent and the time for the remaining distance:
   \[

On the first day, 5 people came to inflate both of their bike tires, and 3 people came to inflate all 3 tires of their tricycle. At the end of the day, one customer came with a unicycle. How much money did Shannon earn that day?

To solve this, we calculate the total cost for each type of vehicle:

- For the bikes (2 tires each): 5 bikes * 2 tires/bike * $0.25/tire = $2.50
- For the tricycle (3 tires): 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = $2.25
- For the unicycle (1 tire): 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = $0.25

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings:
$2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

So, Shannon earned $\\boxed{5} that day.",5,5

On Tuesday and Thursday, he attends two classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. In a semester, there are 16 weeks of classes. How many hours does Kai spend in class during the semester?

To calculate the total hours Kai spends in class during the semester, we can break it down as follows:

- From Monday to Friday, there are 3 days a week, and he attends 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, in one week, he spends \(3 \times 3 \times 1 = 9\) hours in class.
- From Tuesday to Thursday, there are 2 days a week, and he attends 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, in one week, he spends \(2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\) hours in class.
- Therefore, in one week, Kai spends \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours in class.
- Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours spent in class during the semester is \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

The number of hours Kai spends in class during the semester is \\boxed{272}",272,272

Each roll of bread is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill lays all the sweet bread products end to end, how many feet long will the total length be?

To solve this, we need to convert all lengths to the same unit and then add them up.

- Rolls of bread: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Chocolate croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet = 1440 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)

Now we add the lengths together:
1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

Therefore, the total length when all the sweet bread products are laid end to end is $\\boxed{280}$.",280,280

If each month, the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas, how many bananas must he order to have enough for two months?

To find out how many bananas he needs to order for two months, we first calculate the total number of bananas each type of animal needs in one month and then multiply by two.

- Monkeys: 200 bananas/month × 2 months = 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas/month × 2 months = 800 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas/month × 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total number of bananas needed for two months:
400 bananas (monkeys) + 800 bananas (gorillas) + 200 bananas (baboons) = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper must order $\\boxed{1400}$ bananas to have enough for two months.",1400,1400

To solve this, we start with the original number of tadpoles:
- Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles.

Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under the lotus leaves, which means they are no longer hidden:
- 11 - 6 = 5 tadpoles are still hidden.

Answer: To find out how many fish both Fugin and Locksin caught in total, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish they caught and then sum them up.

Fugin caught:
- Starfish: 10
- Crabs: 6
- Cartoon fish: 3

Locksin caught:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5

mgsm-th-162,"Translation: If a glass costs $20 per bag and the price increases by 20% every two months, what will be the price of one bag of glass after 36 months have passed?

To solve this, we need to calculate the price increase over 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, there will be 18 price increases (36 months / 2 months per increase).

The formula to calculate the price after each increase is:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Old Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate}) \]

Given:
- Initial price (Old Price) = $20
- Increase rate = 20% = 0.20
- Number of increases = 18

Let's calculate the price after 18 increases:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we calculate \((1.20)^{18}\):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 13.7858 \]

Finally, calculate the new price:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times 13.7858 \approx 275.716 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of one bag of glass after 36 months will be approximately $275.72.

1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: S = 2B
2. In 2 years, their total age will be 28: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

We can substitute the first equation into the second:
(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
3B + 4 = 28

If Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum, what does she need to pay in one year?

To find out how much Jessica needs to pay in one year, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments:

- Student loan minimum: $300/month
- Credit card minimum: $200/month
- Mortgage minimum: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum, so she needs to pay at least 51% of the total minimum monthly payment (since 50% is the minimum):

Question: Jean is 2 years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was half as old as Jean plus 5 years. If Jean is now 30 years old, how old is Jean?

Answer:
Let's denote the current ages of Jean, Mark, and Jan as \( J \), \( M \), and \( A \) respectively.

Given:
- \( J = 30 \)
- Two years ago, Mark's age was half of Jean's age at that time plus 5 years.

First, let's express the ages two years ago:
- Jean's age two years ago: \( J - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 \)
- Mark's age two years ago: \( M - 2 \)

According to the problem, two years ago Mark's age was half of Jean's age at that time plus 5 years:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (J - 2) + 5 \]

Substitute \( J = 30 \) into the equation:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (30 - 2) + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

mgsm-th-183,"Translation of the question:
A two-team track and field team is competing in a 4x400-meter relay race, where each team has four members, each running 400 meters or one lap around the standard track. One of the two teams is equally strong, with each member running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is weaker; the first runner of this team takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters. Each subsequent runner in this team runs 3 seconds faster than the previous one. How many seconds ahead will the faster team be when they finish the race?

Answer:
To determine how many seconds ahead the faster team will be, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the race.

For the faster team:
- The first runner takes 55 seconds.
- The second runner takes 55 - 3 = 52 seconds.
- The third runner takes 52 - 3 = 49 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 49 - 3 = 46 seconds.

The total time for the faster team is: 55 + 52 + 49 + 46 = 202 seconds.

For the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The total time for the slower team is: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is: 222 - 202 = 20 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win the race by $\boxed{20}$.",20,2
mgsm-th-184,"Translation: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. What is the percentage by which the probability of rolling a number higher than 3 is greater than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers?

To solve this, we first calculate the probabilities for each event:

1. **Probability of rolling a number higher than 3:**
   - The favorable outcomes are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Probability = $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 50\%$.

2. **Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$.
   - Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also $\frac{1}{2}$.
   - Combined probability = $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\%$.

Now, we find the difference in probabilities:
- Probability of rolling a number higher than 3: 50%
- Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers: 25%
- Difference = 50% - 25% = 25%

Therefore, the percentage by which the probability of rolling a number higher than 3 is greater than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is $\\boxed{25}$.",25,25

Russell works at a pet store and is distributing hay to various animals. He has 3 cages for mice, each receiving 6 pieces of hay. He also has 10 hamster cages, each receiving 5 pieces of hay, and a rabbit hutch where he gives 20 pieces of hay to all the rabbits combined. He doesn't have to distribute hay in the store anymore. If he gives 160 pieces of hay to all the small animals, how many mice are there in each cage of mice?

Let's solve the problem step by step:
1. Let's denote the number of mice in each of the 3 cages as \( x \).
2. Each mouse receives 6 pieces of hay, so the total number of pieces of hay given to the mice is \( 6x \).
3. The total number of pieces of hay given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
4. The total number of pieces of hay given to the rabbits is 20.
5. The total number of pieces of hay given to all the small animals is 160.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 6x + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 6x + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, there are 15 mice in each cage of mice.

mgsm-th-187,"Question: Mandie owes Benediction $100 and they agreed to charge a 2% monthly interest if Mandie can pay off the debt in 3 months. How much should Mandie pay Benediction each month?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount Mandie will owe after 3 months with a 2% monthly interest. 

The formula for calculating the future value with compound interest is:
\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Present Value} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Future Value} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 100 \times (1.02)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 106.12 \]

So, Mandie will owe Benediction $106.12 after 3 months. To pay off the debt in 3 months, she should pay:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{106.12}{3} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 35.37 \]

Therefore, Mandie should pay Benediction $35.37 each month.

Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games the team lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than it lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

If Sylvie has been working at the company for five years and the last month she worked was December, how much will Sylvie's total salary for the entire year be after working for another three years?

To solve this, we first calculate Sylvie's salary after five years of work:

Starting salary = $600
Increase after five years = 10% of $600 = $60
Salary after five years = $600 + $60 = $660

After working for another three years, her salary will increase again by 10%:

Salary after another three years = $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726

Answer:
Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

From the problem, we have:

""Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies do both of them eat in total?""

To solve this, we first determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times \text{Amir's cookies} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cody's cookies} + \text{Amir's cookies} = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir is:

polymath-low-th-106,"Translation: John has 3 boxes, with each box having dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches. The sides of the boxes are 1 inch thick. What is the total internal volume of all 3 boxes?

To calculate the internal volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the sides from the dimensions. So, the internal dimensions of each box would be:

- Length: 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches
- Width: 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches
- Height: 4 - 1 = 3 inches

The internal volume of one box is then 3 inches * 4 inches * 3 inches = 36 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total internal volume of all 3 boxes is 36 cubic inches * 3 = 108 cubic inches.

Therefore, the total internal volume of all 3 boxes is \\boxed{108}.",108,72

Every night, Franke watches TV after finishing his homework. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches his favorite long episodes, one episode each night. On Wednesday, he watches short episodes, a few of them, each 30 minutes long. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches one long episode and one short episode each night. On Friday, because it's the weekend, he can stay up late and watches two long episodes each night. If he watches TV for a total of 7 hours, how many short episodes of 30 minutes each does he watch on Wednesday.

Answer:
Let's break down the time spent watching TV each day:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 long episodes each night. Let's assume each long episode is 45 minutes (since the total time is 7 hours or 420 minutes over 7 days, and the total time for long episodes is 180 minutes).
- Wednesday: 1 long episode and 1 short episode (30 minutes each).
- Thursday: 1 long episode and 1 short episode (30 minutes each).
- Friday: 2 long episodes each night, totaling 90 minutes (180 minutes over 2 days).

Now, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 long episodes * 45 minutes = 90 minutes each night * 2 nights = 180 minutes.
- Wednesday: 1 long episode * 45 minutes + 1 short episode * 30 minutes = 45 + 30 = 75 minutes.
- Thursday: 1 long episode * 45 minutes + 1 short episode * 30 minutes = 45 + 30 = 75 minutes.
- Friday: 2 long episodes * 45 minutes = 90 minutes.

Total time spent watching TV: 180 (Monday and Tuesday) + 75 (Wednesday) + 75 (Thursday) + 90 (Friday) = 420 minutes.

Given that the total time spent watching TV is 7 hours (420 minutes), and we already accounted for the time spent on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, the remaining time for Wednesday is:
420 - (180 + 75 + 75 + 90) = 420 - 420 = 0 minutes.

Therefore, Franke does not watch any short episodes on Wednesday.

polymath-low-th-108,"Question: Henry is baking cookies for the local cookie contest. He needs to make twice the amount of cookies he baked last year. After baking, he realizes he made 15 extra cookies and dropped 5 while arranging them to cool. Now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

1. He needs to make twice the amount of cookies he baked last year, so he should have made \( 2x \) cookies.
2. He made 15 extra cookies, so the total number of cookies he made is \( 2x + 15 \).
3. He dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he actually has is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
4. We know that he has 110 cookies now, so we can set up the equation: \( 2x + 10 = 110 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[
2x + 10 = 110 \\
2x = 110 - 10 \\
2x = 100 \\
x = 50
\]

Therefore, Henry baked \( 50 \) cookies last year.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons without any refund:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total refund for 10 gallons:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

They therefore unroll the largest possible number of dried fruit cookie sheets they can find. However, someone made a mistake. Beatrice's cookie sheets are 24 cm wide by 24 cm long, while Marcelle's are 14 cm wide by 3 cm long. If both people eat all their cookie sheets, on average, how much did they eat.

To solve this, we calculate the area of each cookie sheet and then find the average area they ate.

Area of Beatrice's cookie sheet = 24 cm * 24 cm = 576 cm²
Area of Marcelle's cookie sheet = 14 cm * 3 cm = 42 cm²

Total area of Beatrice's cookie sheets = 576 cm²
Total area of Marcelle's cookie sheets = 42 cm²

Total area of all cookie sheets = 576 cm² + 42 cm² = 618 cm²

Total number of cookie sheets = 576 / 576 + 42 / 42 = 1 + 1 = 2

Average area eaten per person = 618 cm² / 2 = 309 cm²

Therefore, the average amount they ate is $\\boxed{309}$ cm².",309,45
polymath-low-th-111,"Question: While Julia was in the lake, her boat developed a leak. For every ten feet she rowed towards the shore, two liters of water entered the boat. It took Julia ten and a half minutes to row twenty feet and it took her sixty-four minutes to reach the shore. How much water entered the boat when Julia rowed back to the shore?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed towards the shore and then use the rate of water entering the boat to find the total amount of water that entered.

1. Julia rowed 20 feet towards the shore.
2. For every 10 feet, 2 liters of water entered the boat. Therefore, for 20 feet, the amount of water that entered is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. Julia took 10.5 minutes to row 20 feet. We need to find out how much water would have entered if she had rowed the entire 64 minutes at the same rate.

4. We know that 10.5 minutes corresponds to 4 liters. Therefore, the rate of water entering the boat is:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ liters}}{10.5 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

5. To find the total amount of water that would have entered in 64 minutes, we use the rate:
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{4 \text{ liters}}{10.5 \text{ minutes}}\right) \times 64 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \frac{4 \times 64}{10.5} \text{ liters}

Brittanee's phone can store more photos than the number of ducks in a photo of ducks that Jamal took at the zoo by 50 times. If Jamal's phone can store 1,800 photos, how many ducks can Jamal see in the zoo photo?

Let's denote the number of ducks in the photo as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jamal's phone can store 1,800 photos.
2. Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittanee's phone.
3. Brittanee's phone can store 50 times more photos than the number of ducks in the photo of ducks that Jamal took at the zoo.

First, we calculate the number of photos Brittanee's phone can store:
\[ \text{Photos on Brittanee's phone} = \frac{\text{Photos on Jamal's phone}}{6} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that Brittanee's phone can store 50 times more photos than the number of ducks in the photo:
\[ \text{Photos on Brittanee's phone} = 50 \times D \]

Setting the two expressions for the number of photos on Brittanee's phone equal to each other:
\[ 50D = 300 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jamal can see \(\boxed{6}\) ducks in the zoo photo.",6,6
polymath-low-th-115,"Question: Sasha noticed that the scraps of wood have increased in price by 50% over the past few months after she bought some of the scraps. Since she has some scraps left over, she decided to sell them. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood, each costing $10, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood, each costing $16. How much profit will she make if she sells all the scraps?

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total cost of the wood Sasha bought and the total selling price of the wood she plans to sell.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 wood is:
10 pieces * $10/piece = $100

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 wood is:
5 pieces * $16/piece = $80

The total cost of the wood is:
$100 + $80 = $180

Next, we need to determine the selling price of the scraps. The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 wood has increased by 50%, so the new price is:
$10 * 1.5 = $15/piece

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 wood remains the same at $16/piece.

The total selling price of the wood Sasha plans to sell is:
10 pieces * $15/piece + 5 pieces * $16/piece = $150 + $80 = $230

Finally, the profit Sasha will make is:
$230 - $180 = $50

Therefore, the profit Sasha will make is $\\boxed{50}",50,90

Question: When Kate makes coffee, she uses sugar in teaspoons and water in glasses in a ratio of 7:13. If the total number of teaspoons of sugar and glasses of water she uses adds up to 120, how many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Let's solve this problem:
Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar and \( y \) be the number of glasses of water.
According to the problem, we have the following equations:
\[ x + y = 120 \]
\[ \frac{x}{7} = \frac{y}{13} \]

From the second equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = \frac{13}{7}x \]

Substitute \( y \) in the first equation:
\[ x + \frac{13}{7}x = 120 \]
\[ \frac{7x + 13x}{7} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20x}{7} = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 840 \]
\[ x = 42 \]

Therefore, Kate used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

A few days later, more cargo containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. How many cargo containers were brought in on the second day if each cargo container had 5 vehicles?

Let's denote the number of cargo containers brought in on the second day as x. Each container has 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles added on the second day would be 5x.

From the information given, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the additional containers were brought in. Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, which is 10 vehicles. So, the equation representing the total number of vehicles after the second day is:

10 + 5x = 30

Now, let's solve for x:

5x = 30 - 10

If Adrian and Larisha's salaries increase at the same rate and Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of salary they both received four years later.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Calculate Adrian's salary four years ago:**
   Adrian's initial salary = $40,000

2. **Calculate Larisha's salary four years ago:**
   Let Larisha's initial salary be \( L \).
   Given that Adrian's salary is 30% more than Larisha's:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.30L = 1.30L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = 30,769.23 \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. **Calculate Adrian's salary four years later:**
   Adrian's salary increased by 40%:
   \[
   \text{New Adrian's salary} = 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Calculate Larisha's salary four years later:**
   Assuming Larisha's salary increases at the same rate as Adrian's, we calculate:

To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

1. Distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

2. Distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours):
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together gives us the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
