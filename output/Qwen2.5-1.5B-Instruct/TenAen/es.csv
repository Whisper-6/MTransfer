mgsm-es-47,"English translation: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?

Let's denote the cost of a blue tie as \( B \) and the cost of a red tie as \( R \). According to the problem, \( B = 40 \) dollars and \( R = 1.5 \times B = 1.5 \times 40 = 60 \) dollars.

John spent $200 on blue ties, so the number of blue ties he bought is \( \frac{200}{B} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \) ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) red ties.

The total cost of the blue ties is \( 5 \times B = 5 \times 40 = 200 \) dollars.

The total cost of the red ties is \( 10 \times R = 10 \times 60 = 600 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is \( 200 + 600 = 800 \) dollars.

The answer is: $800.",800,800
mgsm-es-48,"English translation: Tracy used a 4-foot-long wire to support tomato plants in the garden. She cut the wire into pieces of 6 inches each. How many pieces did she get?

To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, as the length of each piece is given in inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy got:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy got $8$ pieces of wire.",8,8
mgsm-es-49,"The English translation of the question is:

Richard lives in a 15-story apartment building. On each floor, there are 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. How many unoccupied units are there in the building?

To find the number of unoccupied units, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then subtract the number of occupied units.

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building:
\[ \text{Total units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor} \]
\[ \text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Total units} = 120 \]

2. Calculate the number of occupied units:
\[ \text{Occupied units} = \text{Total units} \times \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ \text{Occupied units} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ \text{Occupied units} = 90 \]

3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units:
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = \text{Total units} - \text{Occupied units} \]
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 \]
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 30 \]

Therefore, the final answer is $30$.",30,30
mgsm-es-50,"English translation: Lloyd has a poultry farm. The hens lay 252 eggs per day, and he sells them at $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd earn per week from the sale of eggs?

To find out how much Lloyd earns per week from the sale of eggs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per week.
3. Calculate the total earnings per week from the sale of eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
Lloyd's hens lay 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per week.
There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs laid per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings per week from the sale of eggs.
The eggs are sold at $2 per dozen, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ dollars}}{12 \text{ eggs}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ dollars/egg} \]
Therefore, the total earnings per week from the sale of eggs is:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ dollars/egg} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Lloyd earns $294 per week from the sale of eggs.",294,294

Doubtfire sisters are driving to their house with 7 cats they adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to warn them that their two domestic cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, the other cat, who has had 12. How many cats does the Doubtfire family now have?

To find the answer, we need to calculate the number of adopted kittens for each cat and then add it to the original number of cats they adopted.

1. Patchy has had 3 times the number of adopted kittens as Trixie. Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens, so Patchy has had \(3 \times 12 = 36\) adopted kittens.
2. Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens.
3. The original number of cats they adopted was 7.

Now, we add the adopted kittens to the original number of cats:

\(7 \text{ (original)} + 36 \text{ (Patchy's adopted kittens)} + 12 \text{ (Trixie's adopted kittens)} = 55\)

mgsm-es-55,"English translation: Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops. With the lollipops that remain, Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. How many bags can Jean fill?

To determine how many bags Jean can fill, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lollipops remaining after Jean eats 2.
2. Determine how many bags can be filled with the remaining lollipops, given that each bag holds 2 lollipops.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops remaining.

mgsm-es-57,"English translation: A wooden bridge cannot bear more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck fully loaded with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will cross the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of boxes.
- The weight of one box as 15 pounds.
- The total weight of the truck (driver and cargo) as 3755 pounds.
- The weight of the bridge as 5000 pounds.

The total weight of the truck is the sum of the weight of the driver and the weight of the cargo, which is \( 3755 + 15x \) pounds. The total weight of the boxes is \( 15x \) pounds. The weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3755 + 15x + 15x \leq 5000 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3755 + 30x \leq 5000 \]

Subtract 3755 from both sides:

\[ 30x \leq 1245 \]

Divide both sides by 30:

\[ x \leq \frac{1245}{30} \]

\[ x \leq 41.5 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 41.

To calculate Marcy's annual pension after renouncing after 30 years, we need to consider the following:

1. The pension she receives for the first 20 years is $50,000 per year.
2. The pension she receives for the next 10 years (from age 20 to 30) is 5% of $50,000 per year.

Let's calculate the pension for the first 20 years:
\[ \text{Pension for first 20 years} = 20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \]

Next, we calculate the pension for the next 10 years:
\[ \text{Pension for next 10 years} = 10 \times (50,000 \times 0.05) = 10 \times 2,500 = 25,000 \]

Now, we add these two amounts together to find the total pension after 30 years:
\[ \text{Total pension} = 1,000,000 + 25,000 = 1,025,000 \]

Finally, we divide the total pension by 30 to find her annual pension:
\[ \text{Annual pension} = \frac{1,025,000}{30} = 34,166.67 \]

4. A bag of dog food contains 110 tazas.
5. We need to calculate how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use for the first year.

Let's calculate the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:

- For the first 180 days, she needs 1 taza per day, so she will need 180 tazas.
- Since 110 tazas are in one bag, she will need $\frac{180}{110}$ bags for the first 180 days.

If Raymond washes half of Sarah's laundry, and Sarah washes four times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash if Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah washes four times as much laundry as David, so David washes:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}

3. Raymond washes half of Sarah's laundry, so Raymond washes:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

Let's denote the number of games lost as \( L \) and the number of games won as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Now, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

How many blocks of the quilt does he have in total?

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Gene has been going on vacations since he was 23 years old.
2. He goes on four vacations a year.
3. We need to find out how many years he has been going on vacations.

To find the total number of years he has been going on vacations, we subtract his age when he started from his current age:

\[ \text{Total years} = \text{Current age} - \text{Age when he started} \]
\[ \text{Total years} = 34 - 23 \]
\[ \text{Total years} = 11 \]

Since he goes on four vacations a year, we multiply the total number of years by the number of vacations per year:

\[ \text{Total blocks} = \text{Total years} \times \text{Vacations per year} \]
\[ \text{Total blocks} = 11 \times 4 \]

The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of its employees by 10% of their initial salary each year for those who have been in the company for five years. If Sylvie just turned 5 years old in December last year, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?

To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each of the next three years.

1. **Initial Salary**: $600 per month
2. **Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200 per year

Now, let's calculate the salary increase for each of the next three years:

- **Year 1**: Increase = $600 * 10% = $600 * 0.10 = $60
- **Year 2**: Increase = $600 * 10% = $600 * 0.10 = $60
- **Year 3**: Increase = $600 * 10% = $600 * 0.10 = $60

Total increase over three years = $60 + $60 + $60 = $180

If Lee runs the 400-meter obstacle race in 38 seconds, how many seconds faster can Gerald run it thanks to his improved diet?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter obstacle race and then calculate how much faster he can run it after improving his speed by 10%.

1. **Determine the initial time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter obstacle race:**
   - Lee can run the 400-meter obstacle race in 38 seconds.
   - Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald's initial time is \(38 - 2 = 36\) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%, so his new speed is 110% of his original speed.
   - Let \(v\) be Gerald's original speed in meters per second. His new speed is \(1.1v\).

3. **Determine the new time it takes for Gerald to run the 400-meter obstacle race:**
   - The distance is 400 meters.
   - The new time \(t\) is given by the formula \(t = \frac{d}{v_{\text{new}}}\), where \(d = 400\) meters and \(v_{\text{new}} = 1.1v\).
   - Therefore, \(t = \frac{400}{1.1v}\).

4. **Calculate the difference in time between Lee and Gerald:**
   - The difference in time is \(t_{\text{Lee}} - t_{\text{Gerald}}\).
   - \(t_{\text{Lee}} = 38\) seconds.
   - \(t_{\text{Gerald}} = \frac{400}{1.1v}\).

5. **Simplify the expression for \(t_{\text{Gerald}}\):**

mgsm-es-141,"The question in English is:

There are 700 bees in a beehive. There are twice as many worker bees as bee babies, and twice as many bee babies as queen bees. How many worker bees are there?

Let's denote:
- $W$ as the number of worker bees,
- $B$ as the number of bee babies,
- $Q$ as the number of queen bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. $W = 2B$ (twice as many worker bees as bee babies)
2. $B = 2Q$ (twice as many bee babies as queen bees)
3. $W + B + Q = 700$ (total number of bees)

First, we substitute the expressions for $B$ and $Q$ from the first two equations into the third equation:

\[
W + 2Q + Q = 700
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
W + 3Q = 700
\]

Now, using the first equation $W = 2B$ and substituting $B = 2Q$:

\[
2B + 3Q = 700
\]

Substitute $B = 2Q$:

\[
2(2Q) + 3Q = 700
\]

Simplify:

\[
4Q + 3Q = 700
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
7Q = 700
\]

Solve for $Q$:

\[
Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
\]

Now, we can find $B$ and $W$ using $B = 2Q$ and $W = 2B$:

\[
B = 2 \times 100 = 200
\]

\[
W = 2 \times 200 = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees.

To calculate this, we need to know the number of harvests John can make in a year. Since there are 4 harvests in a year (every 3 months), we can calculate the total number of pine trees John can harvest.

Total number of pine trees = Number of hectares * Number of pine trees per hectare * Number of harvests per year

Total number of pine trees = 10 hectares * 100 trees/hectare * 4 harvests/year

Johnny is picking up the toys from the floor of his room. There were scattered on the floor a Lego block box of 500 pieces, another that had 3 times as many pieces as the 500-piece box, and another that had 1/4 the number of pieces. How many Lego blocks does Johnny collect if he combines all the Lego blocks?

Now, let's calculate the total number of Lego blocks:

1. The first box has 500 pieces.
2. The second box has 3 times as many pieces as the first box, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first box, so it has \( \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \) pieces.

Then she observes that half of this amount returns in the following 6 hours. She sees twice as many bees as the first time leave the hive and fly away in the following 6 hours. Then, each bee that left the hive before and did not return returns to the hive in the following 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. First 6 hours: 30 bees leave.
2. Next 6 hours: Half of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. Next 6 hours: Twice as many bees leave as the first time, which is 60 bees.
4. Next 6 hours: Each bee that left before and didn't return returns, which is 30 bees.

- First 6 hours: 30 bees leave.
- Next 6 hours: 15 bees return.
- Next 6 hours: 60 bees leave.
- Next 6 hours: 30 bees return.

Total bees that return = 30 (first 6 hours) + 15 (next 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) + 30 (next 6 hours)

Dave bought a large bag of fried potatoes and ate fourteen before a hungry gull stole the bag from his hands. When the gull landed, it ate half the amount of fried potatoes Dave had eaten. Then, three sparrows scared him away, and each sparrow ate three potatoes. Later, a chipmunk stole two-thirds of the remaining potatoes. The ants took the last potato, leaving five. How many fried potatoes were in the bag that Dave bought?

To solve this, let's denote the total number of fried potatoes in the bag as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 potatoes.
2. The gull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) potatoes.
3. Three sparrows scared him away, and each sparrow ate 3 potatoes, so the sparrows ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) potatoes.
4. The chipmunk stole two-thirds of the remaining potatoes, so the chipmunk ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 14 - 7 - 9) = \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) \) potatoes.
5. The ants took the last potato, leaving 5 potatoes.

We can set up the equation based on the remaining potatoes:

\[ x - 14 - 7 - 9 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]

\[ x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}x + 20 - 1 = 5 \]

\[ \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \]

\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \]

\[ x = 18 \]

So, the total number of fried potatoes in the bag that Dave bought is $18$.",18,48

To solve this, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then sum them up.

1. **Total length of croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill orders 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants = 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

2. **Total length of baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill orders 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

3. **Total length of panes:**
   - Each pan is 4 inches long.
   - Bill orders 300 panes.
   - Total length of panes = 300 panes * 4 inches/pan = 1200 inches.

Now, we sum up the total lengths:

- Total length of croissants = 720 inches.
- Total length of baguettes = 120 feet.
- Total length of panes = 1200 inches.

To convert all lengths to feet, we need to convert inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches):

- Total length of croissants in feet = 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet.
- Total length of panes in feet = 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet.

Finally, summing up all the lengths in feet:

- Total length in feet = 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) + 100 feet (panes) = 280 feet.

mgsm-es-162,"English translation: If a ball pit costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much will a ball pit cost after 36 months?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the ball pit after 36 months, considering the price increase every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the ball pit is $20.
2. **Price Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% every two months.

Let's denote the initial price as \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars.

After the first two months, the price will be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \times 1.20 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

After the next two months (which is 4 months total), the price will be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.20) = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.80 \text{ dollars} \]

After the next two months (which is 6 months total), the price will be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 + 0.20) = 28.80 \times 1.20 = 34.56 \text{ dollars} \]

We can see that the price increases by a factor of 1.20 every two months. After 36 months, which is 18 two-month periods, the price will be:
\[ P_{18} = P_0 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 6.2996 \]

So, the final price after 36 months will be:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 6.2996 \approx 125.992 \text{ dollars} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

In a room, there are different toys: 5 red cars, 3 collectible dolls, and one doll. The doll costs the same as the 3 collectible dolls and one red car. One collectible doll costs $5. How much are all the toys worth if a collectible doll costs $5?

Now, let's answer the question in English:

Let's denote the cost of a collectible doll as \( D \), the cost of a red car as \( R \), and the cost of a doll as \( T \). According to the problem, we have:

- \( D = 5 \) (cost of a collectible doll)
- \( T = 3D + R \) (cost of a doll is the same as the cost of 3 collectible dolls and one red car)
- \( R = 4 \) (cost of a red car)

Now, let's calculate the cost of a doll:

\( T = 3 \times 5 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19 \)

So, the cost of a doll is $19.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:

- The cost of 5 red cars is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- The cost of 3 collectible dolls is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- The cost of one doll is \( 19 \)

If she liquidates her taxes herself, she will spend 3 hours less on independent work and will earn $35/hour less. The tax consultant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires a tax consultant?

Let's denote the number of hours Jackie would spend on independent work if she hires a tax consultant as \( h \). Since she spends 3 hours less on independent work if she hires a tax consultant, the number of hours she would spend on independent work if she liquidates her taxes herself is \( h + 3 \).

The hourly wage for Jackie if she hires a tax consultant is $90/hour. Therefore, the total cost of hiring a tax consultant is:
\[ 90 \times h = 90h \]

The hourly wage for Jackie if she liquidates her taxes herself is $35/hour. Therefore, the total cost of liquidating her taxes herself is:

The difference in the total cost between hiring a tax consultant and liquidating her taxes herself is:

Therefore, if Jackie hires a tax consultant, she will have $55h - 105 more money than if she liquidates her taxes herself. Since the problem does not provide the value of \( h \), the final answer in terms of \( h \) is:

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon they prepare, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and they get 20 glasses per gallon. If the profit was $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Let's calculate the total cost of lemons:

1. They sell each gallon for 20 glasses.
2. Each glass sells for $0.50, so the total revenue from one gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.
3. Their profit is $25, so the total cost of lemons is the total revenue minus the profit: $10 - $25 = -$15.

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons.",15,15

Sandra threatened to switch suppliers if she didn't receive the red roses before 5 p. m. How many red roses does Fred need to deliver before 5 p. m. to keep Sandra's business?

Let's denote the number of white lilies as \( w \). According to the problem, the number of carnations is \( 5w \), and the number of red roses is \( 4 \times 5w = 20w \).

The total number of flowers Sandra ordered is the sum of the white lilies, carnations, and red roses:
\[ w + 5w + 20w = 26w \]

Fred needs to deliver the red roses to Sandra, and Sandra wants to keep her business. Therefore, Fred needs to deliver all the red roses to Sandra before 5 p. m. The number of red roses Sandra needs to deliver is \( 20w \).

To find \( w \), we need to know the total number of flowers Sandra ordered. However, the problem does not provide the total number of flowers Sandra ordered. If we assume that the total number of flowers Sandra ordered is \( 26w \) and we need to find the number of red roses Sandra needs to deliver, we can express it as:

1. Let's define the variables:
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's current age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.
   - Let \( A \) be Jan's current age.

2. According to the problem, Jan's current age \( A \) is 30 years. So, \( A = 30 \).

3. The problem states that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, we can write:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

4. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Two years ago, Jan's age was \( A - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 \). So, two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \) and half of Jan's age was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \). Therefore, we can write:

5. Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 \implies M = 14 + 2 \implies M = 16

Two field and track teams compete against each other in a 4 x 400 meters relay; a race in which each competing team is formed by four members and each one runs 400 meters, or a lap, around a standard track. One of the two teams is well formed and each of its members will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less formed; the first runner will run their 400 meters in 60 seconds, then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Taking into account this information, how many seconds will the faster team win?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total time for each team to complete the relay race.

1. **First Team (well formed):**
   - Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
   - There are 4 members.
   - Total time for the first team = \( 4 \times 55 \) seconds.

2. **Second Team (less formed):**
   - The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
   - Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.
   - We need to calculate the time for each runner and sum them up.

Let's calculate the times for the second team:

- **Runner 1:** 60 seconds
- **Runner 2:** 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- **Runner 3:** 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- **Runner 4:** 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Now, sum the times for the second team:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, compare the total times:
- First team: \( 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds} \)
- Second team: 222 seconds

The first team wins by:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then find the difference between them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes.
   - The total number of outcomes is 6.
   - Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{number > 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll.
   - The total number of outcomes for two consecutive rolls is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).
   - Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = \frac{3 \times 3}{36} = \frac{9}{36} = 0.25

3. **Difference between the probabilities:**
   - The difference between the two probabilities is:

Now, to find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother, we add Jenna's apples to her mother's apples:

mgsm-es-186,"English translation: Russell works at a pet store and distributes straw among rodents. The rats are in 3 cages in groups of equal size and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are separated and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit pen where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. Straw is not used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \). Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is \( 3r \). Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is \( 6 \times 3r = 18r \). According to the problem, this number is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 18r = 160 \]

To find \( r \), we solve for \( r \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 18:

\[ r = \frac{160}{18} = \frac{80}{9} \approx 8.89 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to check if 160 pieces of straw can be evenly distributed among the rats in each cage. If we assume \( r = 8 \) (since 8 is the closest whole number to \( \frac{80}{9} \)), then the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats would be:

\[ 18 \times 8 = 144 \]

This is less than 160, so let's try \( r = 9 \):

\[ 18 \times 9 = 162 \]

This is more than 160, so \( r = 8 \) is the correct number of rats per cage. Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]",8,5

To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owed after 3 months with the interest compounded monthly.

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 12 \) (interest is compounded monthly)
- \( t = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25 \) years

Plugging these values into the formula:
\[ A = 100 \left(1 + \frac{0.02}{12}\right)^{12 \times 0.25} \]
\[ A = 100 \left(1 + 0.00166667\right)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \left(1.00166667\right)^3 \]
\[ A \approx 100 \times 1.0050166667 \]
\[ A \approx 100.50166667 \]

If originally there were 30 cars on the highway, how many cars passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes?

To find the answer, we need to calculate the number of cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes. Let's break it down:

1. **Original number of cars**: 30
2. **Cars that took a detour**: 5
3. **Cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote this number as \( x \)

The total number of cars that passed through the congestion is the sum of the cars that took a detour and the cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes. This can be expressed as:
\[ 5 + x \]

Since the total number of cars on the highway at the start was 30, and the number of cars that took a detour is 5, the number of cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes must be:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, we have:

2. Subtract the thickness of the walls from the volume of one box to get the volume of the interior.
3. Multiply the interior volume of one box by 3 to get the total volume of the 3 boxes.

Let's start with the volume of one box. The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one box, the dimensions are 5 inches (length), 6 inches (width), and 4 inches (height). So, the volume of one box is:

\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 5 \times 6 \times 4 = 120 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the volume of one box to get the volume of the interior. The thickness of the walls is 1 inch on each side, so the total thickness is 2 inches (1 inch on each side). Therefore, the volume of the interior of one box is:

\[ \text{Volume of interior of one box} = 120 - 2 \times 1 = 120 - 2 = 118 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Finally, we multiply the volume of the interior of one box by 3 to get the total volume of the 3 boxes:

\[ \text{Total volume of 3 boxes} = 118 \times 3 = 354 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{354} \]",354,72
mgsm-es-107,"The question is already in English. Let's break down the information provided:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night
- Wednesday: 30 minutes each night
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours

Total hours of TV watched: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total minutes of TV watched:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night = 60 minutes each night
- Wednesday: 30 minutes each night
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours = 120 minutes

Total minutes of TV watched: 60 + 60 + 30 + 90 + 120 = 380 minutes

Now, let's calculate the number of 30-minute episodes watched:

380 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 12.67 episodes

Since we can't watch a fraction of an episode, we round down to the nearest whole number:

12 episodes of 30 minutes

So, we can set up the equation:

\[2x + 10 = 110\]

Now, let's solve for $x$:

Unfortunately, someone made a mistake and Beatrice was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, while Marcel was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. If both ate their full amount, how many did they eat on average?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate and then find the average.

1. **Calculate the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate:**
   - Beatrice was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
   - Total roll-ups Beatrice ate = \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of roll-ups Marcel ate:**
   - Marcel was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
   - Total roll-ups Marcel ate = \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of roll-ups both ate together:**
   - Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcel's roll-ups
   - Total roll-ups = \( 48 + 42 = 90 \).

4. **Calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten by both:**
   - Average roll-ups = Total roll-ups / 2
   - Average roll-ups = \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \).

It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water was in Julia's boat when she reached the shore?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance Julia rowed and the rate at which water was entering the boat. Then, we can calculate the amount of water that entered the boat.

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia rowed:**
   Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, the speed of the boat in feet per second is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance to the shore:**
   The distance to the shore is 64 seconds. Therefore, the total distance Julia rowed is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:**
   The boat was leaking at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the total amount of water that entered the boat is:
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}

Jamal's phone can store 6 times as many photos as Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of birds in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo?

To solve this, we need to find the number of birds in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds as \( B \).

Given:
- Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos.
- Jamal's phone can store 6 times as many photos as Brittany's phone.
- Brittany's phone can store 50 times the number of birds as the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo.

Let's denote the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took as \( D \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( 1800 = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone's capacity} \)
2. \( \text{Brittany's phone's capacity} = 50 \times B \)
3. \( 1800 = 6 \times 50 \times B \)

Now, let's solve for \( B \):

\( 1800 = 300 \times B \)

\( B = \frac{1800}{300} \)

\( B = 6 \)

Now, we know that the number of birds in the photo Jamal took is 6. Since the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took is \( D \), we can find \( D \) by dividing the number of birds by the number of ducks per bird:

\( D = \frac{B}{\text{birds per duck}} \)

Since we don't have information about the number of birds per duck, we can't determine the exact number of ducks \( D \) in the photo Jamal took. However, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of sugar cubes used based on the given ratio and total amount of sugar cubes and cups of water.

Given:
- Ratio of sugar cubes to cups of water = 7:13
- Total amount of sugar cubes and cups of water = 120

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of cups of water
- \( y \) as the number of sugar cubes

According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{y}{x} = \frac{7}{13} \]

We also know:
\[ x + y = 120 \]

From the ratio, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = \frac{7}{13}x \]

Substitute \( y \) in the total amount equation:
\[ x + \frac{7}{13}x = 120 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{13}{13}x + \frac{7}{13}x = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20}{13}x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120 \times 13}{20} \]
\[ x = \frac{120 \times 13}{20} = 6 \times 13 = 78 \]

Now, substitute \( x \) back to find \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{7}{13} \times 78 \]
\[ y = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

So, Katy used 42 sugar cubes.

If both their salaries increased at the same rate, and four years ago Adrien earned $40,000, calculate the total salary they received four years later.

Let's denote:
- Adrien's salary four years ago as \( A_0 \)
- Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L_0 \)

From the problem, we know:
\[ A_0 = 40,000 \]

Four years later, Adrien's salary was:
\[ A_4 = A_0 \times (1 + 0.30) = 40,000 \times 1.30 = 52,000 \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary was:
\[ L_4 = L_0 \times (1 + 0.30) = 40,000 \times 1.30 = 52,000 \]

Let's denote the increase rate as \( r \). Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%:
\[ A_4 = A_0 \times (1 + r) \times (1 + r) = 40,000 \times (1 + r)^2 \]

Since \( A_4 = 52,000 \), we have:
\[ 52,000 = 40,000 \times (1 + r)^2 \]
\[ (1 + r)^2 = \frac{52,000}{40,000} = 1.30 \]
\[ 1 + r = \sqrt{1.30} \]
\[ r = \sqrt{1.30} - 1 \]

Now, let's calculate \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{1.30} - 1 \approx 1.1401 - 1 = 0.1401 \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary increased by 40%:
\[ L_4 = L_0 \times (1 + r) \times (1 + r) = 40,000 \times (1 + 0.1401)^2 \]
\[ L_4 = 40,000 \times (1.1401)^2 \]
\[ L_4 = 40,000 \times 1.299161 \]
\[ L_4 \approx 51,966.44 \]

mgsm-es-128,"The question is already in English, so no translation is needed. Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of each item:**
   - Let the cost of a pimiento be \( x \) dollars.
   - The cost of a sandía is three times the cost of a pimiento, so it is \( 3x \) dollars.
   - The cost of a naranja is 5 dollars less than the cost of a sandía, so it is \( 3x - 5 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost for Dillon:**
   - Dillon buys 4 sandías, so the total cost for sandías is \( 4 \times 3x = 12x \) dollars.
   - Dillon buys 20 pimientos, so the total cost for pimientos is \( 20 \times x = 20x \) dollars.
   - Dillon buys 10 naranjas, so the total cost for naranjas is \( 10 \times (3x - 5) = 30x - 50 \) dollars.

3. **Sum up the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12x + 20x + 30x - 50 = 62x - 50
   \]

4. **Substitute the value of \( x \):**
   - We know that each pimiento costs $15, so \( x = 15 \).
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 62 \times 15 - 50 = 930 - 50 = 880
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880. The final answer is:

mgsm-es-129,"The hospital sees 500 people per day. On average, each patient is examined for 24 minutes. Doctors charge $150 per hour, and the hospital charges $200 per hour for patients.

First, we need to find out how many patients are examined per hour. Since each patient takes 24 minutes, we divide the total number of minutes in a day by the number of minutes it takes to examine one patient:

$$
\text{Number of patients examined per hour} = \frac{24 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 24 \text{ patients per hour}
$$

Next, we calculate the total number of patients examined in a day:

$$
\text{Total patients examined per day} = 24 \text{ patients per hour} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 576 \text{ patients per day}
$$

Now, we calculate the total revenue from patient examinations:

$$
\text{Total revenue from patient examinations} = 576 \text{ patients per day} \times \$200 \text{ per hour} = \$115,200 \text{ per day}
$$

Next, we calculate the total revenue from doctor consultations:

$$
\text{Total revenue from doctor consultations} = 576 \text{ patients per day} \times \$150 \text{ per hour} = \$86,400 \text{ per day}
$$

Finally, we calculate the total hospital revenue:

$$
\text{Total hospital revenue} = \$115,200 \text{ per day} + \$86,400 \text{ per day} = \$201,600 \text{ per day}

- Carousel: 2 (Pam) + 2 (Fred) = 4 times

Each attraction costs 6 tickets, so we multiply the total number of times each attraction was used by the cost per attraction:

- Roller coaster: 6 times * 6 tickets = 36 tickets
- Carousel: 4 times * 6 tickets = 24 tickets

Finally, we add the total number of tickets used for both attractions:

Let's denote:
- $v_w$ as the speed at which Dana can walk,
- $v_r$ as the speed at which Dana can run,
- $v_s$ as the speed at which Dana can jump.

From the problem, we have:
1. $v_r = 4 \cdot v_w$ (Dana can run four times faster than she can walk),
2. $v_s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot v_r$ (Dana can jump at half the speed of she can run).

Given $v_s = 3$ miles per hour, we can find $v_r$ and $v_w$:
- $v_r = 2 \cdot v_s = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$ miles per hour,
- $v_w = \frac{v_r}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$ miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance Dana can cover in six hours:

Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only known weapon that could kill the dragon, to a distance of 400 feet, within the dragon's reach. However, when Polly had the precious blue stone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when she didn't have it. How far away from the dragon's flames could Polly stand to hit the dragon with the golden javelin having the precious blue stone?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum distance Polly could stand away from the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the golden javelin, given that she has the precious blue stone.

1. **Initial Distance with No Stone:**
   - Polly can throw the golden javelin to a distance of 400 feet.

2. **Distance with the Stone:**
   - With the precious blue stone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than when she doesn't have the stone. Therefore, the distance with the stone is:

3. **Maximum Distance from Flames:**
   - The dragon's flames are within a distance of 1000 feet.
   - To hit the dragon with the golden javelin, Polly must stand at least 1000 feet away from the flames.

4. **Comparing Distances:**
   - Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the flames with the stone, which is farther than the 1000 feet allowed by the dragon's flames.

Therefore, Polly can stand $1200$ feet away from the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the golden javelin having the precious blue stone.

To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of calories in the bag. Since each serving has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in the bag, the total calories in the bag is:

\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more calories you can consume to reach your daily goal of 2000 calories. Subtract the calories you have already consumed from your daily goal:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings you can consume with the remaining calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since you can't consume a fraction of a serving, you can consume 0.8 servings. Finally, we calculate the total grams of french fries you can consume by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:

polymath-low-es-45,"English translation: Meredith is an independent blogger who writes about health topics and delivers to her clients daily as her permanent job. An article on her blog takes an average of 4 hours between research and writing. Last week, Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and twice as many articles on Tuesday as she did on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent on writing articles over the three days.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - Time spent: 4 hours per article.
   - Total time for Monday: \( 5 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 20 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Meredith wrote twice as many articles as on Monday.
   - Number of articles: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ articles} \).
   - Time spent: 4 hours per article.
   - Total time for Tuesday: \( 10 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 40 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Meredith wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ articles} \).
   - Time spent: 4 hours per article.
   - Total time for Wednesday: \( 20 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 80 \text{ hours} \).

4. **Total time spent:**
   - Sum of the hours for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
   - \( 20 \text{ hours} + 40 \text{ hours} + 80 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent on writing articles over the three days is $140$.",140,104

Candice put 80 sticky notes in her bag before going to work at the café. On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a package of sticky notes. At work, she placed one sticky note in each of the 220 different coffee cups. If she has 23 sticky notes left in total, how many sticky notes were in the package she bought?

To find out how many sticky notes were in the package she bought, we need to calculate the total number of sticky notes she used and then subtract the number of sticky notes she has left.

Total sticky notes used = Sticky notes in bag + Sticky notes in coffee cups + Sticky notes left
Total sticky notes used = 80 + 220 + 23
Total sticky notes used = 323

Now, we subtract the number of sticky notes she has left from the total number of sticky notes used to find out how many sticky notes were in the package she bought.

Sticky notes in package = Total sticky notes used - Sticky notes left
Sticky notes in package = 323 - 23
Sticky notes in package = 300

Therefore, the answer is 300.",300,163
polymath-low-es-47,"English translation: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?

Let's denote the cost of a blue tie as \( x \). Given that each blue tie costs $40, we have:
\[ x = 40 \]

The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Therefore, the cost of a red tie is:
\[ 1.5x = 1.5 \times 40 = 60 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Let \( y \) be the number of blue ties. Then the number of red ties is \( 2y \). The total cost of the blue ties is:
\[ 2y \times 40 = 80y \]

The total cost of the red ties is:
\[ 2y \times 60 = 120y \]

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[ 80y + 120y = 200y \]

We know that the total amount spent on blue ties is $200. Therefore:
\[ 200 = 200y \]
\[ y = 1 \]

So, John bought 1 blue tie and \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) red ties. The total amount spent on ties is:
\[ 200 + 120 = 320 \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

To find the answer, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.",8,8

polymath-low-es-50,"English translation: Lloyd runs a poultry farm. The hens lay 252 eggs per day and he sells them at $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd earn per week from egg sales?

To calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs sold per day:**
   - The hens lay 252 eggs per day.

2. **Calculate the number of dozens of eggs sold per day:**
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the number of eggs by 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens per day} = \frac{252}{12} = 21
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Lloyd sells each dozen for $2.
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars per dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 294 \text{ dollars}

She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, the other cat, who has had 12. How many cats does the Doubtfire family now have?

To solve this, we need to calculate the number of adopted kittens for each cat and then add them to the original number of cats they adopted.

1. Patchy has had 3 times the number of adopted kittens as Trixie. Since Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens, Patchy has had \(3 \times 12 = 36\) adopted kittens.
2. Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens.
3. The original number of cats they adopted was 7.

Now, we add the adopted kittens to the original number of cats:
\[ 7 \text{ (original cats)} + 36 \text{ (Patchy's adopted kittens)} + 12 \text{ (Trixie's adopted kittens)} = 55 \]

Therefore, the family Doubtfire now has $55$ cats.",55,40

\[ \text{Remaining lollipops} = 30 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Remaining lollipops} = 28 \]

Now, Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the number of remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Remaining lollipops}}{\text{Lollipops per bag}} \]

polymath-low-es-57,"English translation: A wooden bridge cannot support more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck fully loaded with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will cross the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To solve this problem, let's denote the number of boxes as \( x \).

1. The weight of the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
2. The weight of each box is 15 pounds.
3. The weight of \( x \) boxes is \( 15x \) pounds.
4. The total weight of the truck and the boxes is \( 3755 + 15x \) pounds.
5. The bridge can only support up to 5000 pounds.

We need to find the maximum value of \( x \) such that the total weight does not exceed 5000 pounds. This can be formulated as the inequality:
\[ 3755 + 15x \leq 5000 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( 15x \) by subtracting 3755 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ 15x \leq 5000 - 3755 \]
\[ 15x \leq 1245 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 15:
\[ x \leq \frac{1245}{15} \]
\[ x \leq 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \( 83 \).

The answer is \( \boxed{83} \).",83,83

Stephen made an online food order. The final bill was $40,000. Since the order was made through a delivery service, a 25% surcharge was added on the total final amount, and $3,000 was charged for shipping costs. Stephen also added a tip of $4,000. After the extra charges, what was the final price of Stephen's food purchase?

To find the final price of Stephen's food purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount after adding the 25% surcharge.
2. Add the shipping costs.
3. Add the tip.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount after adding the 25% surcharge.
Total amount after surcharge = $40,000 + (25% of $40,000)
Total amount after surcharge = $40,000 + (0.25 * $40,000)
Total amount after surcharge = $40,000 + $10,000
Total amount after surcharge = $50,000

Step 2: Add the shipping costs.
Total amount after surcharge and shipping = $50,000 + $3,000
Total amount after surcharge and shipping = $53,000

Step 3: Add the tip.
Final price of the purchase = $53,000 + $4,000
Final price of the purchase = $57,000

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of oranges in good condition. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of oranges**: 25
2. **Oranges in poor condition**: 1
3. **Oranges that have not ripened**: 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5

Now, we need to find the number of oranges that are in good condition. We can do this by subtracting the number of oranges in poor condition, the number of oranges that have not ripened, and the number of sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Let's calculate the number of oranges in good condition:

\[
\text{Number of oranges in good condition} = \text{Total number of oranges} - \text{Oranges in poor condition} - \text{Oranges that have not ripened} - \text{Oranges that are sour}

Answer: To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the following:

1. For the first 20 years, she receives a pension of $50,000 per year.
2. For the next 10 years (from age 20 to 30), she receives 5% of the value of her pension, which is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

So, her total pension for the first 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.
For the next 10 years, her pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year, which totals $52,500 * 10 = $525,000.

Therefore, her total pension after 30 years is $1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000.

If the streaming company charged the initial fee for the first half of the year and then charged a 10% reduction in the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she will have paid at the end of the year for the streaming service.

To find the total amount paid, we need to calculate the cost for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, then sum them up.

1. **First half of the year:**
   - The initial fee is $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half of the year = $140/month * 6 months = $840.

2. **Second half of the year:**
   - The streaming company charged a 10% reduction in the second half of the year.
   - The reduced fee is 90% of the initial fee.
   - Reduced fee per month = $140 * 0.90 = $126.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year = $126/month * 6 months = $756.

To solve this, we first calculate the total time Jim spends watching TV and reading in one week:

- Watching TV: 2 hours
- Reading: 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

Total time per week: 2 hours (watching TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours

In Dr. Wertz's school, there are twice as many boys as girls. If there are 60 girls and 5 students for each teacher, how many teachers are there?

To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys in the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the number of students.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys in the school.
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.
The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Step 3: Determine the number of teachers based on the number of students.
If there are 5 students for each teacher, the number of teachers is:

polymath-low-es-78,"English translation: Vincent can buy flowers in bunches of 3 units for $2.50 or in bunches of 2 units for $1.00. How much money does he save if he buys 18 flowers at the best price?

To determine the best price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for both options and compare them.

1. **Bunch of 3 flowers for $2.50:**
   - Cost per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (repeating)

2. **Bunch of 2 flowers for $1.00:**
   - Cost per flower = $1.00 / 2 = $0.50

Since the cost per flower is lower when buying in bunches of 2, Vincent should choose the second option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the best price ($0.50 per flower):

- Total cost = 18 flowers * $0.50/flower = $9.00

Next, we calculate the total cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers at the original prices:

- Cost at original prices = (18 flowers * $2.50) + (18 flowers * $1.00) = $45.00 + $18.00 = $63.00

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost at the best price from the total cost at the original prices:

The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of its employees by 10% of their initial salary each year for those who have been in the company for five years. If Sylvie just turned 5 years old in December last year, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?

To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's current salary before the increase.
2. Calculate the salary increase for the first year.
3. Calculate the salary increase for the second year.
4. Calculate the salary increase for the third year.
5. Add the salary increases to the current salary to get the final annual salary.

Let's go through these steps:

1. **Current Salary**: Sylvie's current salary is $600 per month. To find her annual salary, we multiply this by 12:
   \[
   \text{Current Annual Salary} = 600 \times 12 = 7200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **First Year Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary. The initial salary is $600, so the increase is:
   \[
   \text{First Year Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Adding this to the current salary:
   \[
   \text{Salary after First Year} = 7200 + 60 = 7260 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Second Year Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the new salary. The new salary is $7260, so the increase is:
   \[
   \text{Second Year Increase} = 7260 \times 0.10 = 726 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Adding this to the salary after the first year:
   \[
   \text{Salary after Second Year} = 7260 + 726 = 7986 \text{ dollars}

4. **Third Year Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the new salary. The new salary is $7986, so the increase is:
   \[
   \text{Third Year Increase} = 7986 \times 0.10 = 798.60 \text{ dollars}

   Adding this to the salary after the second year:
   \[
   \text{Salary after Third Year} = 7986 + 798.60 = 8784.60 \text{ dollars}

Since James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, we can substitute \( I = 10 \) into the fourth equation:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now we know Corey's age is 11. Using the second equation, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. Using the first equation, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 = 9 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]",4,4

Lee could previously run the 400-meter obstacle race two seconds faster than Gerald. However, Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400-meter obstacle race in 38 seconds, how many seconds faster can Gerald run it thanks to his improved diet?

To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's initial speed and then calculate how much faster he can run the race after improving his diet.

1. **Determine Lee's initial speed:**
   - Lee's time to run the race: 38 seconds
   - Lee's initial speed: \( \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \)

2. **Determine Gerald's initial speed:**
   - Lee's initial speed is two seconds faster than Gerald's initial speed.
   - Let \( v \) be Gerald's initial speed.
   - Therefore, Lee's speed = \( v + 2 \) seconds faster.
   - Since Lee's speed is \( \frac{400}{38} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \), we have:
     \[
     v + 2 = 10.53
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = 10.53 - 2 = 8.53 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

3. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - Improved speed = \( 8.53 \times 1.10 \approx 9.383 \text{ meters/second} \)

4. **Determine the time it takes for Gerald to run the race with his improved speed:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = \( \frac{400}{9.383} \approx 42.5 \text{ seconds} \)

5. **Calculate the difference in time between Lee and Gerald:**
   - Difference = Lee's time - Gerald's time
   - Difference = \( 38 - 42.5 \approx 4.5 \text{ seconds} \)

Therefore, Gerald can run the race 4.5 seconds faster than Lee thanks to his improved diet.",5,36
polymath-low-es-94,"English translation: In a neighborhood, the number of domestic cats is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. If there are two cats for each dog and the number of dogs is 60, how many domestic animals are there in total in the neighborhood?

Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \) and the number of cats as \( C \). According to the problem, we have:

1. \( D = 60 \)
2. \( C = 2D \)
3. \( C = D - 12 \)

First, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the second equation to find \( C \):

\[ C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we use the third equation to verify \( C \):

\[ C = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

We see that there is a discrepancy here because \( C \) should be 120 based on the second equation, but it is 48 based on the third equation. This indicates that the third equation might have a different interpretation or there might be a mistake in the problem statement. However, if we assume the third equation is correct and \( C = 60 - 12 = 48 \), then we can proceed with the total number of animals:

The total number of animals is the sum of the number of dogs and cats:

\[ \text{Total} = D + C = 60 + 48 = 108 \]

So, the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is \( \boxed{108} \).",108,348

Some of the cars passed in the first 15 minutes of the congestion, then 20 more cars passed in the remaining 15 minutes of the congestion. 5 cars from the line took a break to avoid having to cross the congestion. Originally, there were 30 cars on the highway. How many cars passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were 30 cars on the highway initially.
2. **Cars passing in the first 15 minutes**: Some cars passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).
3. **Cars passing in the remaining 15 minutes**: After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed through the congestion. So, the total number of cars that passed through the congestion in the first 30 minutes is \( x + 20 \).
4. **Cars taking a break**: 5 cars from the line took a break to avoid the congestion. This means that 5 cars did not pass through the congestion.

The total number of cars on the highway after the congestion is 30 cars minus the 5 cars that took a break. Therefore, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ 30 - 5 = x + 20 \]
Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 25 = x + 20 \]
To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 25 - 20 = x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{5} \).",5,5

As she is generous, she decided that tomorrow she will give 1 pot of pots in each window to friends and relatives. How many pots of pots will Mary have left?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pots**: Mary has 40 windows, and each window has 2 pots of pots.
   \[
   40 \text{ windows} \times 2 \text{ pots per window} = 80 \text{ pots}

When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he wanted. When the cookies are cooling, he discards 5 cookies, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies this year as he did last year. So, he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies this year.

When he bakes, he bakes 15 more cookies than he planned, so he actually bakes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

To solve this, we first need to understand the ratio. The ratio of sugar cubes to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 sugar cubes, there are 13 cups of water.

Let's denote the number of sugar cubes as \( S \) and the number of cups of water as \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

We also know that the total number of sugar cubes and cups of water is 120:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

From the ratio, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ W = \frac{13}{7}S \]

Now, substitute \( W \) in the total equation:
\[ S + \frac{13}{7}S = 120 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{7S + 13S}{7} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20S}{7} = 120 \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ 20S = 120 \times 7 \]

- The total number of vehicles after the first day was 30.
- Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day was 30 - 10 = 20.

polymath-low-es-119,"English translation: Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased by 40% compared to what he was earning four years ago. If their salaries increased at the same rate, and four years ago Adrien earned $40,000, calculate the total salary they received four years later.

Let's denote Adrien's salary four years ago as $A$ and Lylah's salary four years ago as $L$. According to the problem, $A = 40,000$.

Four years later, Adrien's salary was $A \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000$.

Lylah's salary four years later was $L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30$.

Since their salaries increased at the same rate, we have:
\[ \frac{56,000}{40,000} = \frac{L \times 1.30}{L} \]

Solving for $L$, we get:
\[ \frac{56,000}{40,000} = \frac{1.30}{1} \]

\[ 1.40 = 1.30 \]

This indicates that the ratio of their salaries four years ago was 1.40 to 1.30, which is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was:
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.40} = 28,571.43 \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary was:
\[ L \times 1.30 = 28,571.43 \times 1.30 = 37,143.00 \]

So, the total salary they received four years later is:
\[ 56,000 + 37,143.00 = 93,143.00 \]

Therefore, the answer is $93,143.00$.",0,95200

She stamps a third of the stamps that need stamps. If now there are 30 stamps in the stack of stamps that already have stamps, how many were in that stack when Jenny started?

Let's denote the number of stamps already in the stack as $x$.

According to the problem, Jenny stamps a third of the stamps that need stamps. So, the number of stamps that need stamps is $60 - x$.

Since she stamps a third of the stamps that need stamps, the number of stamps she stamps is $\frac{1}{3}(60 - x)$.

After stamping, the number of stamps in the stack of stamps that already have stamps is $x + \frac{1}{3}(60 - x)$.

According to the problem, after stamping, there are 30 stamps in the stack of stamps that already have stamps. So, we have:

$$x + \frac{1}{3}(60 - x) = 30$$

Solving this equation, we get:

$$x + 20 - \frac{1}{3}x = 30$$
$$\frac{2}{3}x = 10$$
$$x = 15$$

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the trunks:**
   - The selling price of each trunk is $30.
   - The total number of trunks is 100.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is $30 * 100 = $3000.

3. **Determine the total cost of purchasing the trunks:**
   - The cost to purchase one trunk is $20.
   - The total number of trunks is 100.
   - Therefore, the total purchase cost is $20 * 100 = $2000.

4. **Calculate the total profit:**

Let's denote the cost of one ticket as \( T \) and the cost of one attraction as \( A \). From the problem, we know:

1. The cost of three tickets is $20.25:

   Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{20.25}{3} = 6.75

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 plastic roses to the collection. How many more plastic roses of the color pink than white roses did Sue have at noon on Sunday?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of roses at each step:

1. **Friday morning**: Sue has 18 plastic roses.
2. **Saturday morning**: The neighbors remove a third of the roses, which is 18 / 3 = 6 roses. Then they paint the remaining roses white. So, they have 18 - 6 = 12 white roses and 6 pink roses.
3. **Sunday morning**: The neighbors add another 18 plastic roses. Sue now has 12 white roses + 6 pink roses + 18 new roses = 36 roses in total.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of pink roses and white roses:

- Number of pink roses: 6
- Number of white roses: 12
- Difference: 6 - 12 = -6

Since we are looking for how many more pink roses there are than white roses, the answer is negative, indicating that there are 6 fewer pink roses than white roses. Therefore, Sue had 6 fewer pink roses than white roses at noon on Sunday.

The editorial B pays Mark double what the editorial A pays per sentence. Mark reviews a total of 1000 sentences each week, and the editorial A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How many cents does Mark earn in a week?

To solve this, let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of sentences Mark reviews for the editorial A.
- \( y \) as the number of sentences Mark reviews for the editorial B.

We know that:
1. \( x + y = 1000 \) (total sentences reviewed per week)
2. \( y = 2x \) (since editorial B pays double)

Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the first equation:
\[ x + 2x = 1000 \]
\[ 3x = 1000 \]
\[ x = \frac{1000}{3} \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for each editorial:
- Earnings for the editorial A: \( 5 \) cents/sentence \( \times \frac{1000}{3} \) sentences
- Earnings for the editorial B: \( 10 \) cents/sentence \( \times \frac{1000}{3} \) sentences

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:**
   - The cost of the jacket is $30.
   - The cost of each pair of shoes is $20.
   - Sara wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes.
   - Total cost for shoes = $20 × 2 = $40.
   - Total cost for the jacket and shoes = $30 + $40 = $70.

2. **Calculate Sara's total earnings from caring for children:**
   - Sara earns $5 for each time she cares for the children.
   - She cares for the children 4 times.
   - Total earnings from caring for children = $5 × 4 = $20.

3. **Calculate Sara's total earnings from cutting the lawn:**
   - Sara earns $4 for each time she cuts the lawn.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times she cuts the lawn.
   - Total earnings from cutting the lawn = $4 × x.

4. **Set up the equation to find \( x \):**
   - Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes.
   - She already has $10.
   - Total amount needed = $70 - $10 = $60.
   - Total earnings from caring for children + Total earnings from cutting the lawn = $60.
   - $20 + $4x = $60.

5. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   \[
   20 + 4x = 60
   \]
   \[
   4x = 60 - 20
   \]
   \[
   4x = 40
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{4}
   \]
   \[
   x = 10

Therefore, Sara needs to cut the lawn 10 times before she can buy the jacket and shoes. The final answer is \( \boxed{10} \).",10,10
mgsm-es-211,"English translation: Jerry has a chicken coop. The red hens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white hens lay 5 eggs per day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white hens than red hens, how many red hens does he have?

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red hens.
- \( w \) as the number of white hens.

From the problem, we know:
1. The white hens lay 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by the white hens is \( 5w \).
2. The red hens lay 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by the red hens is \( 3r \).
3. The total number of eggs collected every day is 42, so we have the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. We also know that the number of white hens is two more than the number of red hens, so we have the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]
Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42

\[
8r = 32

\[
r = 4

On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers over the third day was 500, how many customers did she count on the third day?

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 100 \).

On the second day, the number of customers is \( x + 50 \). Since \( x = 100 \), the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let the number of customers on the third day be \( y \). The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 50) + y = 500 \]

Substituting \( x = 100 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 100 + (100 + 50) + y = 500 \]
\[ 100 + 150 + y = 500 \]
\[ 250 + y = 500 \]
\[ y = 500 - 250 \]
\[ y = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \( \boxed{250} \).",250,250

The large pool is losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, and the small pool is also losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. After 4 minutes, the amount of water lost by both pools is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 \text{ gallons/minute} = 16 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 4 minutes, the amount of water in the large pool is:
\[ x - 16 \text{ gallons} \]

And the amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ x - 16 \text{ gallons} \]

According to the problem, the large pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -3x = -48 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, the initial amount of water in each pool was 16 gallons. After 4 minutes, the amount of water in the small pool is:

- Harriet's current age as \( H \)
- Zack's current age as \( Z \)

Given:
- \( H = 21 \) years (Harriet's current age)
- \( H = \frac{1}{2}Z \) (Harriet has half the age of Zack)
- \( A = 3H \) (Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age)

First, we find Zack's current age \( Z \):
\[
H = \frac{1}{2}Z \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2}Z \implies Z = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years}

- Naomi: \( N = 68 \)
- Yuri: \( Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10 \)
- Brianna: \( B = N + 17 \)
- Jojo: \( J \)

We know the total points scored by all four students is 251:
\[ N + Y + B + J = 251 \]

First, substitute the known values for \( N \) and \( B \):
\[ 68 + Y + (68 + 17) + J = 251 \]

mgsm-es-4,"English translation: Wendi feeds each of her chickens with a mixed chicken feed that contains seeds, larvae, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. She feeds them three separate meals a day. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 tins of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 tins of feed. How many tins of feed does she need to give her chickens in the last meal of the day if Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens?

To find out how many tins of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the last meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she has already given them.

In the morning, she gives 15 tins.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 tins.

Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 tins + 25 tins = 40 tins.

Now, we know that Wendi has 20 chickens in her flock. Since she feeds them three separate meals a day, we can calculate the amount of feed per chicken by dividing the total feed by the number of chickens:

Feed per chicken = Total feed / Number of chickens
Feed per chicken = 40 tins / 20 chickens
Feed per chicken = 2 tins

Since Wendi feeds the chickens three separate meals a day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed for the last meal by multiplying the feed per chicken by the number of chickens:

Total feed for the last meal = Feed per chicken * Number of chickens
Total feed for the last meal = 2 tins * 20 chickens
Total feed for the last meal = 40 tins

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 40 tins of feed in the last meal of the day.",40,20

Usually, she can download 2 GB per minute, but during 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file?

To solve this problem, we need to break down the download process into two parts: the initial download and the restart.

1. **Initial Download:**
   - Carla can download 2 GB per minute.
   - The total file size is 200 GB.
   - The initial download time is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Initial download time} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes}

A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but then it reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have in total during the three months?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Month:**
   - Downloads: 60

2. **Second Month:**
   - Downloads = 3 times the first month's downloads
   - Downloads = 3 * 60 = 180

3. **Third Month:**

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it will take for the total profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:**
   \[
   \text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the annual cost of planting and maintaining the lemon tree:**

2. Determine the total number of ice cream boxes she needs to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ice cream portions Cynthia consumes in 60 days.
Cynthia consumes one portion of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:

mgsm-es-31,"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of caramelos each friend thinks are in the frasco:**
   - The first friend thinks there are 80 caramelos.
   - The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half of the first friend's count. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend thinks there are 40 + 20 = 60 caramelos.
   - The third friend thinks there are 25% more than the first friend's count. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend thinks there are 80 + 20 = 100 caramelos.

2. **Calculate the total number of caramelos according to the friends' estimates:**
   - First friend: 80
   - Second friend: 60
   - Third friend: 100
   - Total: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 caramelos

3. **Calculate the average number of caramelos according to the friends' estimates:**
   - Average = Total number of caramelos / Number of friends
   - Average = 240 / 3 = 80 caramelos

mgsm-es-33,"English translation: Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (gold coins are 30 more than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \( \boxed{70} \) gold coins.",70,70

To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add that to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

First, we calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
\[ \text{Points in the second 20 minutes} = 4 \text{ points} + (4 \text{ points} \times 25\%) \]

\[ \text{Points in the second 20 minutes} = 4 \text{ points} + (4 \text{ points} \times 0.25) \]

\[ \text{Points in the second 20 minutes} = 4 \text{ points} + 1 \text{ point} \]

\[ \text{Points in the second 20 minutes} = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from the first 20 minutes to the points from the second 20 minutes to find the total points scored:

mgsm-es-37,"English translation: John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego toys that he sells for $15 each. He buys 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left over. How many Lego toys does he still have?

Let's denote the number of Lego toys John has as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling the Lego toys:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

John has $5 left over after buying the video games. Therefore, the total amount of money John has is:
\[ 195 + 5 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

We know that John spent $160 on video games, so the amount of money he has left after selling the Lego toys is:
\[ 200 - 160 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each Lego toy is sold for $15, the number of Lego toys John has left is:
\[ \frac{40}{15} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \]

Since the number of Lego toys must be a whole number, we need to check if 2 or 3 Lego toys are left. If John has 2 Lego toys left, he would have:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
This is less than $40, so he must have 3 Lego toys left.

Therefore, the number of Lego toys John has left is:

To find the speed, we need to determine the total time John runs in a week and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance John runs in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time John runs in a week:**
   - On the first day, he runs 3 hours.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. Therefore, each of these days he runs:
     \[
     \text{Time on each of the other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The total time for the other two days is:
     \[
     \text{Total time for other two days} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ hours}

To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking speed and then calculate the distance she can cover in the given time allocation.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can jump at 3 miles per hour.
   - Jumping speed = 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Running speed = 2 * Jumping speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

3. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed = 4 * Walking speed.
   - 6 miles per hour = 4 * Walking speed.
   - Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

The Great Dragon, Perg, sat at the top of Mount Farbo, spitting fire at everything within a distance of 1000 feet. Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only known weapon that could kill the dragon, to a distance of 400 feet, within the dragon's reach. However, when Polly had the precious stone of sapphire, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when she didn't have it. How far away from the dragon's flames could Polly stand to hit the dragon with the golden javelin using the precious stone of sapphire?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when she has the precious stone of sapphire. Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the precious stone as \( d \) feet. According to the problem, with the precious stone of sapphire, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther, so the distance she can throw the javelin with the precious stone is \( 3d \) feet.

The problem states that Polly can throw the javelin to a distance of 400 feet without the precious stone, and with the precious stone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 3d = 400 \]

To find \( d \), we solve for \( d \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ d = \frac{400}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the precious stone of sapphire, which is \( 3d \):
\[ 3d = 3 \times \frac{400}{3} = 400 \]

Since the problem asks for the distance Polly can stand away from the dragon's flames to hit the dragon with the javelin, we need to determine how far away from the dragon's flames Polly can stand. The problem states that the dragon's flames are within a distance of 1000 feet, and Polly needs to be farther away than this distance to hit the dragon with the javelin. Therefore, the distance Polly can stand away from the dragon's flames is:
\[ 1000 - 400 = 600 \]

Thus, the distance Polly can stand away from the dragon's flames to hit the dragon with the javelin using the precious stone of sapphire is:

To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of calories in the bag of fried potatoes:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = \text{Calories per portion} \times \text{Number of portions} \]
\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 250 \, \text{calories/portion} \times 5 \, \text{portions} \]
\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 1250 \, \text{calories} \]

Now, we calculate how many more calories are needed to reach the daily goal of 2000 calories:

\[ \text{Calories needed} = \text{Daily calorie goal} - \text{Calories already consumed} \]
\[ \text{Calories needed} = 2000 \, \text{calories} - 1800 \, \text{calories} \]
\[ \text{Calories needed} = 200 \, \text{calories} \]

Finally, we determine how many grams of fried potatoes can be eaten with the remaining calories:

\[ \text{Grams of fried potatoes} = \frac{\text{Calories needed}}{\text{Calories per portion}} \]
\[ \text{Grams of fried potatoes} = \frac{200 \, \text{calories}}{250 \, \text{calories/portion}} \]

At work, she placed one sticky note on each of the 220 different coffee cups. If she has 23 sticky notes left in total, how many sticky notes were in the package she bought?

To find out how many sticky notes were in the package, we need to calculate the total number of sticky notes Candice used and then subtract the number of sticky notes she has left.

The total number of sticky notes used is the sum of the sticky notes she put in her bag initially, the sticky notes she bought, and the sticky notes she placed on the coffee cups. The number of sticky notes left is 23. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total sticky notes used} = 80 + \text{sticky notes bought} + 220 \]

Since the total number of sticky notes used is the same as the total number of sticky notes left, we can write:

1. Let's denote the number of caramelos Robert has as \( R \).
2. James has 6 more caramelos than Robert, so James has \( R + 6 \) caramelos.
3. John has double the number of caramelos Robert has, so John has \( 2R \).
4. We know that John has 54 caramelos, so \( 2R = 54 \).
5. Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \).
6. Now we know Robert has 27 caramelos.
7. James has \( R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \) caramelos.
8. John has 54 caramelos.

Griffin has 24 fried potatoes, but Kyle took 5. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fried potatoes, and then Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle. If Griffin ended up with 27 fried potatoes, how many fried potatoes did Ginger give to Griffin?

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fried potatoes.
2. Kyle takes 5 fried potatoes, so Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fried potatoes.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fried potatoes. Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 fried potatoes.
4. Ginger gives Griffin a handful of her fried potatoes, and then Colby takes 3 fewer than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fried potatoes. Griffin ends up with 9 + X = 27 fried potatoes, where X is the number of fried potatoes Ginger gave to Griffin.

How many tins of mixed chicken feed does Wendi need to give to her chickens in the last meal of the day if her flock consists of 20 chickens?

Solution:

To find out how many tins of mixed chicken feed Wendi needs to give to her chickens in the last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of mixed chicken feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon, and then subtract this from the total amount of mixed chicken feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon.

Total mixed chicken feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 tins

Total mixed chicken feed given to the flock = 15 + 25 = 40 tins

To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at the Green House, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. This means she had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left after this sale.
2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the Red House, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the Orange House, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners. This means she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - 1 = \frac{2x}{3} - 3 \) vacuum cleaners left.

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 3 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 3 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 8 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 24 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:

3. Therefore, in 4 weeks, Claire eats $3 \times 28 = 84$ eggs.
4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozen eggs she eats: $84 \div 12 = 7$ dozen eggs.

Final answer: $7$ dozen eggs.",7,7
polymath-low-es-19,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Marissa took a hike on a trail that was 12 miles long. She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, then the next 2 miles in another hour. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the rest of the distance?

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Total distance: 12 miles
2. Time taken for the first 4 miles: 1 hour
3. Time taken for the next 2 miles: 1 hour
4. Total time taken: 1 + 1 = 2 hours
5. Desired average speed: 4 miles per hour

To find the speed needed for the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

The remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we can calculate the required speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of $3$ miles per hour for the rest of the distance.",3,6
polymath-low-es-20,"The question is already in English, so the translation is just the original question. To answer it, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial amount of water in the orange juice:**
   - The orange juice contains two-thirds water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange juice is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Amount of water in the pineapple juice:**
   - The pineapple juice contains three-fifths water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple juice is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Total amount of water initially:**
   - Adding the water from both juices:
     \[
     \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Water lost due to spillage:**
   - 1 liter of orange juice is spilled.
   - Therefore, the amount of water lost is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Total amount of water remaining:**
   - Subtracting the lost water from the initial total:
     \[
     \frac{47}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{46}{3} \text{ liters}
     \]

6. **Total volume of the mixture:**
   - The total volume of the mixture is:
     \[
     10 + 15 = 25 \text{ liters}
     \]

7. **Water percentage in the mixture:**
   - The percentage of water in the mixture is:
     \[
     \frac{\frac{46}{3}}{25} = \frac{46}{75} = 0.6133 \approx 61.33\%
     \]

8. **Amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Since the mixture is approximately 61.33% water, the amount of water in 24 liters is:
     \[
     24 \times 0.6133 = 14.7192 \approx 14.72 \text{ liters}
     \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is $14.72$ liters.",72,15

polymath-low-es-24,"English translation: Kyle bought the bestselling book of last year for $19.50, which is a 25% discount off the original price. What was the original price of the book?

To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. Since the book was sold at a 25% discount, Kyle paid 75% of the original price. This can be expressed as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.",26,26
polymath-low-es-25,"First, let's calculate the total cost of the food items that we know the price of:

- $12.50 for the chicken
- 4 cajas de leche at $3 each, so that's 4 * $3 = $12
- 4 manazas at $1.50 each, so that's 4 * $1.50 = $6

Now, let's add up the known costs:

$12.50 (chicken) + $12 (leche) + $6 (manazas) = $20.50

Marie paid a total of $50, so we subtract the known costs from the total to find out how much was spent on the pizzas:

$50 - $20.50 = $29.50

Now, we know each pizza costs $8.50, so we can find out how many pizzas Marie bought by dividing the total spent on pizzas by the price per pizza:

$29.50 / $8.50 = 3.5

Since Marie can't buy half a pizza, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Marie bought 3 pizzas.",3,2

polymath-low-es-27,"English translation: Cynthia comes to a portion of ice cream every night. She buys ice cream boxes with 15 portions of ice cream each at a cost of $4.00 per box. How much will she spend on ice cream after 60 days?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of ice cream portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days and then determine the total cost based on the number of boxes she needs to buy.

1. Calculate the total number of ice cream portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
   - There are 24 hours in a day, and she comes to a portion of ice cream every hour.
   - Therefore, in 60 days, she will come to a portion of ice cream 60 * 24 = 1440 times.
   - Since each portion contains 15 ice cream, the total number of portions is 1440 * 15.

2. Calculate the total cost:
   - The cost of one box is $4.00, so the total cost is the total number of portions multiplied by the cost per box.

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Total number of portions:
   1440 * 15 = 21,600 portions

2. Total cost:
   21,600 * $4.00 = $86,400

polymath-low-es-29,"English translation: Gloria is shopping for shoes when she sees a pair of boots that fit within her shoe budget. However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high-top shoes that together cost $5 less than the boots.

Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the two pairs of high-top shoes is \( 33 + 2 \times 33 = 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the cost of the two pairs of high-top shoes is $5 less than the cost of the boots, so we have the equation:

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The sum of their ages now is 162.

- Darrell's current age as $7x$.
- Allen's current age as $11x$.

According to the information, we have:

Solving for $x$:
\[ 18x = 162 \]
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, we can find the current ages of both:
- Darrell's age: $7x = 7 \times 9 = 63$.
- Allen's age: $11x = 11 \times 9 = 99$.

In 10 years, their ages will be:

polymath-low-es-31,"English translation: Gunter is trying to count the rubber candy pieces in a bottle. He asks his friends how many they think are in the bottle. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half of the first. The third says 25% more than the first. What is their average calculation?

Let's denote the number of candies the first friend thinks is in the bottle as \( x \).

1. The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half of the first friend's count. So, the second friend's count is \( \frac{x}{2} + 20 \).
2. The third friend thinks there are 25% more than the first friend's count. So, the third friend's count is \( x + 0.25x = 1.25x \).

Now, we need to find the average of these three counts:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 20 \right) + 1.25x}{3}
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{x + \frac{x}{2} + 20 + 1.25x}{3} = \frac{\frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 20 + 1.25x}{3} = \frac{\frac{3x}{2} + 20 + 1.25x}{3}
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\frac{3x}{2} + \frac{2.5x}{2} + 20}{3} = \frac{\frac{5.5x}{2} + 20}{3}

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{5.5x}{6} + \frac{20}{3}

So, the average calculation is:
\[
