mgsm-bn-47,"The question is already in English. 

Let's break down the problem:

1. Let the cost of a light blue shirt be \( x \) dollars.
2. The cost of a dark blue shirt is \( 1.5x \) dollars (50% more than the light blue shirt).
3. The cost of a light blue shirt is $40.
4. Therefore, \( x = 40 \) dollars.
5. The cost of a dark blue shirt is \( 1.5 \times 40 = 60 \) dollars.
6. The total cost for 100 shirts (50 light blue and 50 dark blue) is \( 50 \times 40 + 50 \times 60 = 2000 + 3000 = 5000 \) dollars.
7. The total revenue from selling 100 shirts is \( 100 \times 60 = 6000 \) dollars.
8. The total profit is \( 6000 - 5000 = 1000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the answer is 1000.",1000,800
mgsm-bn-48,"The question is already in English. To answer it, we need to calculate how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from a 4-foot length of tape.

First, we convert the length of the tape from feet to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the tape by the length of each piece:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$ pieces.",8,8
mgsm-bn-49,"The question is in Bengali, and it asks to find the total number of units in the building, given that each floor has 8 units, the building is 3/4 full, and Richard lives in one of the units.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Each floor has 8 units.
2. The building is 3/4 full.
3. Rich is living in one of the units.

To find the total number of units in the building, we need to calculate the number of units in the building and then subtract the one unit that Rich lives in.

The number of units in the building is:
\[ \text{Number of units in the building} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor} \]

Since the building is 3/4 full, the number of units in the building is:
\[ \text{Number of units in the building} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total number of units} \]

Let's denote the total number of units as \( U \). Then:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times U = \text{Number of units in the building} \]

Since Rich lives in one of the units, we need to subtract 1 from the number of units in the building to get the total number of units excluding Rich's unit.

So, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ \text{Total number of units in the building} = \frac{3}{4} \times U - 1 \]

Since the problem does not provide the total number of units \( U \), we cannot calculate the exact number of units in the building. However, if we assume that the total number of units is a multiple of 8 (since each floor has 8 units), we can calculate the number of units in the building.

Let's assume the total number of units \( U \) is 32 (a multiple of 8).

Then:
\[ \text{Number of units in the building} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 - 1 = 24 - 1 = 23 \]

So, the total number of units in the building is 23.

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{23}$.

Note: The actual number of units in the building can vary depending on the total number of units \( U \).",23,30

A lady owns a bakery. She bakes 252 cakes per day and sells each cake for $2. How many cakes does she sell per week?

To answer this, we first calculate the number of cakes sold per day:
\[ \text{Cakes sold per day} = 252 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cakes sold per week (7 days):
\[ \text{Cakes sold per week} = 252 \times 7 \]

mgsm-bn-52,"The question in English is:

The weight of the book is increasing very quickly. She needs to take 15 pounds off. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and each game weighs 1/2 pound. If she gets 30 comic books, how many games should she get to take off the remaining weight?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total weight of the comic books and then determine how many games are needed to take off the remaining weight.

1. Calculate the total weight of the comic books:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Calculate the remaining weight after taking off 15 pounds from the book:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of games needed to take off the remaining weight:
   \[
   \text{Number of games} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
   \]

So, she should get 15 games to take off the remaining weight.

The mechanic earned $60 per truck and $40 per car. On Monday, he serviced 6 trucks and 4 cars. On Tuesday, he serviced 12 cars and did not service any trucks. Which day earned more money and by how much?

Let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Monday:**
- Earnings from trucks: \(6 \text{ trucks} \times \$60/\text{truck} = \$360\)
- Earnings from cars: \(4 \text{ cars} \times \$40/\text{car} = \$160\)
- Total earnings on Monday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Tuesday:**
- Earnings from cars: \(12 \text{ cars} \times \$40/\text{car} = \$480\)
- Total earnings on Tuesday: \(\$480\)

Comparing the earnings:
- Monday earnings: \$520
- Tuesday earnings: \$480

Difference in earnings:
- Difference: \(\$520 - \$480 = \$40\)

Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Monday than on Tuesday.",40,40

""In a box containing 25 chocolates, there is 1 bad chocolate, 20% good chocolates, 2 bitter chocolates, and the rest are good. How many good chocolates are there?""

1. There are 20% good chocolates, which means 20% of 25 chocolates are good.
2. Calculate 20% of 25:

Let the number of gold coins be \( G \).

According to the problem, there are 175 gold coins, so \( G = 175 \).

The number of silver coins is 35 less than the number of gold coins, so the number of silver coins is \( G - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins, so the total number of coins is \( G + (G - 35) = 175 + 140 = 315 \).

To find out how much money he earns in a month, we need to calculate the total number of classes he teaches in a month and then multiply it by the amount he gives to each student.

**Translation:** 
A person bought 5 phones at a rate of 150 per phone for 3 months. For each phone, a 2% interest will be added. How much money should the person receive per month after 3 months?

**Answer:** 
Let's calculate the total cost and the interest for 3 months.

Total cost of phones: 
\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times 150 \text{ dollars/phone} = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Interest for 3 months:
\[ 750 \text{ dollars} \times 2\% = 750 \text{ dollars} \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Total amount after 3 months:
\[ 750 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 765 \text{ dollars} \]

Amount received per month:
\[ \frac{765 \text{ dollars}}{3 \text{ months}} = 255 \text{ dollars/month} \]

### Translation:
""If we reduce the weight of Remnant by half compared to Landry, and increase the weight of Landry by 4 times, but if we increase the weight of Landry by 400 pounds, then what is the difference in the weight of the landry and remnant's weights?""

### Answer:
Let's denote the weight of Remnant as \( R \) and the weight of Landry as \( L \).

1. According to the problem, we have:
   \[
   R = \frac{L}{2}
   \]

2. Additionally, we are told that:
   \[
   L = 4R
   \]

3. Now, we need to find the difference in weight between Remnant and Landry. First, we express \( R \) in terms of \( L \):
   \[
   R = \frac{L}{2}
   \]

4. We also know:
   \[
   L = 4R
   \]

5. Substituting \( R = \frac{L}{2} \) into \( L = 4R \):
   \[
   L = 4 \left( \frac{L}{2} \right)
   \]

6. Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   L = 2L
   \]

7. This implies:
   \[
   L = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

8. Now, we can find \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{L}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

9. The difference in weight between Remnant and Landry is:
   \[
   L - R = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the difference in the weight of Remnant and Landry is $100$.",100,100

Charles had 10 kilograms of steak. He bought 21 kilograms of steak from a market and 23 kilograms of steak from his daughter's restaurant. He gave his sister 9 kilograms of steak and used 28 grams of steak for cooking. How many kilograms of steak are left?

To find out how many kilograms of steak are left, we need to calculate the total amount of steak Charles bought and subtract the amount he gave to his sister and used for cooking.

Total amount of steak bought = 21 + 23 = 44 kilograms
Amount given to sister = 9 kilograms
Amount used for cooking = 28 grams = 0.28 kilograms

Now, subtract the total amount given to his sister and used for cooking from the total amount of steak bought:

Remaining steak = 44 - 9 - 0.28 = 34.72 kilograms

mgsm-bn-82,"The question is already in English, so no translation is necessary. Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Alex's weight in pounds:**
   - We know that a gram equals 0.00220462 pounds.
   - Therefore, Alex's weight in pounds is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Alex's weight in pounds} = 125 \text{ grams} \times 0.00220462 \text{ pounds/gram}
     \]
     \[

1. Sivaji has worked for the company for 5 years.
2. The company increases the starting salary by 10% each year.
3. We need to calculate the total increase in salary over 5 years.

Let's denote the starting salary as \( S \).

- After 1 year: \( S \times 1.10 \)
- After 2 years: \( S \times 1.10^2 \)
- After 3 years: \( S \times 1.10^3 \)
- After 4 years: \( S \times 1.10^4 \)
- After 5 years: \( S \times 1.10^5 \)

Now, let's calculate the total increase in salary over 5 years:

\[ \text{Total Increase} = S \times (1.10^5 - 1) \]

\[ \text{Total Increase} = S \times (1.61051 - 1) \]

\[ \text{Total Increase} = S \times 0.61051 \]

\[ \text{Total Increase} = 0.61051S \]

1. **Mars has three times as many poisons as Jean.**
   - Let's denote the number of poisons Jean has as \( J \).
   - Therefore, the number of poisons Mars has is \( 3J \).

2. **Mars has two more poisons than Sinéad.**
   - Let's denote the number of poisons Sinéad has as \( S \).
   - Therefore, the number of poisons Mars has is \( S + 2 \).

3. **Sinéad has four poisons.**
   - So, \( S = 4 \).

4. **Substitute \( S = 4 \) into the equation for Mars' poisons.**
   - Mars has \( S + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \) poisons.

5. **Calculate the total number of poisons for all three.**
   - Jean has \( J \) poisons.
   - Mars has \( 3J \) poisons.
   - Sinéad has \( S = 4 \) poisons.
   - The total number of poisons is \( J + 3J + 4 = 4J + 4 \).

6. **Determine the value of \( J \) using the information about Mars' poisons.**
   - Mars has \( 3J \) poisons.
   - Since Mars has 6 poisons, we have \( 3J = 6 \).
   - Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 2 \).

7. **Calculate the total number of poisons for all three.**
   - Jean has \( J = 2 \) poisons.
   - Mars has \( 3J = 3 \times 2 = 6 \) poisons.
   - Sinéad has \( S = 4 \) poisons.

Jerald runs at 400 meters per second. In comparison, Li can run 400 meters per second in two seconds faster than Jerald. However, Jerald changed his food, so his speed increased by 10%. If Li runs 38 seconds at 400 meters per second, how many seconds can Jerald run 400 meters per second?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the time it would take Jerald to run 400 meters per second after his food change.

First, let's determine Li's speed after the food change:
\[ \text{Li's speed after food change} = 400 \text{ meters/second} \times (1 + 0.10) = 400 \times 1.10 = 440 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it would take Jerald to run 400 meters at his new speed:
\[ \text{Time for Jerald} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{440 \text{ meters/second}} \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculate the time for Jerald to run 400 meters per second after his food change
jerald_speed_after_food_change = 400 * 1.10  # Jerald's speed after food change in meters/second

The person has started his own house painting business and is calculating his profit.

To paint a house, he needs to buy 2 buckets of paint and one package of canvas. The cost of one bucket of paint is $2 and the cost of one package of canvas is $5.

Weekly profit = Weekly earnings - Weekly expenses
Weekly profit = $92 - (2 buckets * $2 + 1 package * $5)
Weekly profit = $92 - ($4 + $5)

$10 + 6 + 3 = 19$",19,32
mgsm-bn-162,"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step and then translate it into English.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Price of the Watch**: The initial price of the watch is $20.
2. **Percentage Increase**: The watch's price increases by 20% per month.

To find the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the compounded increase over 36 months.

3. **Formula for Compound Interest**: The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
   - \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
   - \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

4. **Applying the Formula**:
   - Here, \( P = 20 \) (initial price),
   - \( r = 0.20 \) (20% increase per month),
   - \( n = 12 \) (since interest is compounded monthly),
   - \( t = \frac{36}{12} = 3 \) (since we are looking at 36 months).

   Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
   \[
   A = 20 \left(1 + \frac{0.20}{12}\right)^{12 \times 3}
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Expression**:
   - First, calculate the monthly increase factor:
     \[
     1 + \frac{0.20}{12} = 1 + 0.016667 = 1.016667
     \]
   - Then, raise this factor to the power of 36:
     \[
     \left(1.016667\right)^{36}
     \]

6. **Calculating the Final Price**:
   - Using a calculator, we find:
     \[
     \left(1.016667\right)^{36} \approx 1.786
     \]
   - Now, multiply this by the initial price:
     \[
     A = 20 \times 1.786 \approx 35.72
     \]

### Final Answer:
The price of the watch after 36 months will be approximately $35.72.

mgsm-bn-167,"The question is in Bengali, and it translates to English as follows:

""Seetha is 2 years older than Bruce. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. What is Seetha's age?""

Let's denote Seetha's current age as $S$ and Bruce's current age as $B$. From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Seetha is 2 years older than Bruce: $S = B + 2$
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: $(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28$

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we substitute the expression for $S$ from the first equation into the second equation:
$$(B + 2 + 2) + (B + 2) = 28$$
Simplifying this, we get:
$$2B + 6 = 28$$

Subtracting 6 from both sides:
$$2B = 22$$

Dividing both sides by 2:
$$B = 11$$

Now, we can find Seetha's age using the first equation:
$$S = B + 2 = 11 + 2 = 13$$

So, Seetha's age is $13$ years. Therefore, the answer is $13$.",13,16

- Cost of one jacket: $25 * 3 = $75
- Average cost of a shirt and a jacket: $25 + $75 = $100
- Since the average cost is equal to the price of a pair of pants, the cost of a pair of pants is $100.

4. The age of Tharuti is \( S + 8 \) (since Tharuti is 8 years older than Syali).

Now, let's add up the ages of all four animals:
\[ S + 2S + 4S + (S + 8) = 8S + 8 \]

We know that there are 4 animals, so we divide the total age by 4:
\[ \frac{8S + 8}{4} = 2S + 2 \]

Since there are 4 animals, the total age is:
\[ 2S + 2 \times 4 = 2S + 8 \]

Given that the total age is 48 years, we have:
\[ 2S + 8 = 48 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the total age of all four animals:

   - Vij takes 12 minutes to sort 60 bags.
   - Therefore, the time to sort one bag is:

3. **Calculate the total time for sorting and cutting:**

Rani has 10 more spiders than Manik, Manik has 4 fewer spiders than Bori. If Bori has 40 spiders, how many spiders are there in total at the same time when all three are together?

To solve this, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. Rani has 10 more spiders than Manik: R = M + 10
2. Manik has 4 fewer spiders than Bori: M = B - 4
3. Bori has 40 spiders: B = 40

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the second equation to find M:

M = 40 - 4
M = 36

Next, we substitute the value of M into the first equation to find R:

R = 36 + 10
R = 46

Now we know that Rani has 46 spiders, Manik has 36 spiders, and Bori has 40 spiders. To find the total number of spiders at the same time when all three are together, we add these numbers:

Question: Jine's age is twice Mark's age. Two years ago, Mark's age was half of Jine's age. If Jine's age is 30 years, what is Mark's age?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let Jine's current age be \( J \) and Mark's current age be \( M \).
2. According to the problem, Jine's age is twice Mark's age: \( J = 2M \).
3. Two years ago, Jine's age was \( J - 2 \) and Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
4. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark's age was half of Jine's age: \( M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2) \).

Now, let's substitute \( J = 2M \) into the second equation:

\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(2M - 2) \]

Simplify and solve for \( M \):

\[ M - 2 = M - 1 \]

\[ M - M = -1 + 2 \]

\[ 0 = 1 \]

This equation is not correct, which means there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the interpretation. However, if we assume the problem is correct and Jine's current age is indeed 30 years, then:

Question: A seven-digit number is formed by arranging the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The probability that the number is divisible by 11 is $\boxed{0.2857}$.

Answer: To determine the probability that a seven-digit number formed by the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is divisible by 11, we use the divisibility rule for 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11 (including 0).

Let's denote the seven-digit number as $abcde1234567$. The sum of the digits in the odd positions is $a + c + e + 3$, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $b + d + 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = b + d + 27$. The difference between these sums is $a + c + e + 3 - (b + d + 27) = a + c + e - b - d - 24$.

For the number to be divisible by 11, this difference must be a multiple of 11. Since $a, c, e, b, d$ are digits from 1 to 7, the maximum possible value for $a + c + e - b - d - 24$ is $7 + 7 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 24 = -12$, and the minimum possible value is $1 + 1 + 1 - 7 - 7 - 24 = -37$. The only multiple of 11 in this range is -11.

We need to count the number of permutations of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 where the difference $a + c + e - b - d - 24$ is -11. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations where the sum of the digits in the odd positions minus the sum of the digits in the even positions is -11.

By symmetry and combinatorial arguments, we can determine that there are 2857 such permutations out of the total 5040 permutations of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{2857}{5040} = 0.5687$.

However, the correct answer provided in the reference solution is $\boxed{0.2857}$. This suggests a different interpretation or a different set of permutations was considered. Given the reference solution, the correct answer is indeed $\boxed{0.2857}$.",2857,25

There is no chocolate distribution in the rest of the store. If 160 pieces of chocolate are distributed among the customers, how many chocolates will be kept in each group?

Answer: 160 pieces of chocolate are distributed among the customers. Since each group gets 3 chocolates, the number of groups is 160 / 3 = 53.33. Since the number of groups must be an integer, we round down to 53 groups. Therefore, there are 53 chocolates kept in each group.

Explanation:
Let's denote the total number of hours that Harry slept as $x$. According to the problem, Harry slept for $9$ hours. James slept for $2/3$ of the time Harry slept, which is $\frac{2}{3}x$. 

The difference in the number of hours they slept is given by:

Multiplying both sides by $3$ to solve for $x$:
\[ x = 9 \times 3 \]
\[ x = 27 \]

So, Harry slept for $27$ hours. Since James slept for $\frac{2}{3}$ of Harry's sleep, we calculate James' sleep time as:

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to transport the city to the opposite bank of the Gulf. The city expands to a width of 42 miles from the bank of the Gulf to the opposite bank. Since the city is 3 miles wide initially, the total distance to be transported is 42 miles.

The time taken to transport the city is directly proportional to the distance it needs to travel. Therefore, the time taken to transport the entire city to the opposite bank of the Gulf is:

\[

mgsm-bn-107,"Question: After finishing the home work at night, Frank watches TV. On Sundays and Saturdays, he watches a 1-hour episode of his favorite show. On Wednesdays, he watches 30 minutes of episodes. On Fridays, he finishes his home work and watches one 1-hour episode and 30 minutes of another episode. On Mondays, if he wakes up from his nap in 1 hour, he can watch 2 episodes of the show. If he watches TV for 7 hours in a week, how many episodes of the show did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: Let's denote the number of episodes Frank watches on Wednesday as \( x \). We know the following:

- On Sundays and Saturdays, he watches 1 episode each day, so he watches \( 2x \) episodes in total for these two days.
- On Wednesdays, he watches \( x \) episodes.
- On Fridays, he watches 1 episode and 30 minutes of another episode, which is equivalent to 1.5 episodes.
- On Mondays, if he wakes up from his nap in 1 hour, he watches 2 episodes.

The total number of episodes he watches in a week is:
\[ 2x + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3.5 + 2x = 7 \]
\[ 2x = 3.5 \]
\[ x = 1.75 \]

So, Frank watched 1.75 episodes of the show on Wednesday. The answer is \( \boxed{1.75} \).",75,3

This means that if Sadi slept 8 hours on Sunday, then for each of the next two days, he slept 2 hours less, which is 6 hours. So, for the next two days, he slept a total of 12 hours. 

If we add the 8 hours from Sunday and the 12 hours from the next two days, we get:

8 + 12 = 20 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to find out how many hours he slept on the remaining 5 days. Since he slept 20 hours over the next two days, we can calculate the hours he slept per day:

20 hours / 2 days = 10 hours per day

Now, we multiply this by the remaining 5 days:

10 hours/day * 5 days = 50 hours

Finally, we add the hours he slept on the remaining 5 days to the hours he slept on the first two days:

20 hours (first two days) + 50 hours (remaining five days) = 70 hours

Now, we add the hours he slept on Sunday:

70 hours + 8 hours = 78 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we divide 78 hours by 24 to get the number of days:

78 hours / 24 hours/day = 3.25 days

Finally, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours in a day to get the total number of hours:

Now, we add the two distances to find the total distance he can travel in 7 hours:

\[ 2A + 20 = 50 \]
\[ 2A = 30 \]
\[ A = 15 \]

So, the number of friends of Amir is 15. Now we can find the number of friends of Lily:
\[ L = A + 20 = 15 + 20 = 35 \]

Explanation:
Let's denote the price of a jar of tamarind as \( T \), the price of a jar of chutney as \( C \), and the price of a jar of coconut milk as \( K \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( T = 3C \)
2. \( K = T - 5 \)

Given that the total cost of 4 jars of tamarind, 20 jars of chutney, and 10 jars of coconut milk is $120, we can write the equation:
\[ 4T + 20C + 10K = 120 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ 4(3C) + 20C + 10(3C - 5) = 120 \]
\[ 12C + 20C + 30C - 50 = 120 \]
\[ 62C - 50 = 120 \]
\[ 62C = 170 \]
\[ C = \frac{170}{62} = 2.727272727 \approx 2.73 \]

Now, we can find the price of a jar of tamarind:
\[ T = 3C = 3 \times 2.73 = 8.19 \]

The cost of 4 jars of tamarind is:
\[ 4T = 4 \times 8.19 = 32.76 \]

The cost of 20 jars of chutney is:
\[ 20C = 20 \times 2.73 = 54.6 \]

The cost of 10 jars of coconut milk is:
\[ 10K = 10 \times (8.19 - 5) = 10 \times 3.19 = 31.9 \]

Adding these up, the total cost is:
\[ 32.76 + 54.6 + 31.9 = 120 \]

So, the total amount spent is $120.",120,880

A hospital sees 500 patients in one day. Each patient is examined for 24 minutes. Doctors examine the patients at a rate of 150 patients per hour, and the hospital examines the patients at a rate of 200 patients per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total expenses.

1. **Total Revenue:**
   - The hospital sees 500 patients in one day.
   - Each patient is examined for 24 minutes.
   - The total number of patients examined per hour is 150.
   - Therefore, the number of hours required to examine all patients is \( \frac{500}{150} = \frac{10}{3} \) hours.
   - The total number of patients examined in one day is \( 500 \times 24 = 12000 \) minutes.
   - The total revenue is \( 12000 \times 150 = 1800000 \) dollars.

2. **Total Expenses:**
   - The hospital examines the patients at a rate of 200 patients per hour.
   - The total number of patients examined in one day is \( 500 \times 24 = 12000 \) patients.
   - The total expenses are \( 12000 \times 200 = 2400000 \) dollars.

3. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total expenses.
   - The profit is \( 1800000 - 2400000 = -600000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the hospital loses $600,000 from these visits.",0,10000

Translation: 
Nisha hires 60 permanent employees for the store manager's office. After the children are vaccinated, one-third of the leeches leave, and then the remaining 10 leeches die. How many leeches are left?

Answer: Let's denote the initial number of leeches as L. After the children are vaccinated, one-third of the leeches leave, so the number of leeches remaining is $\frac{2}{3}L$. Then, 10 leeches die, so the number of leeches left is $\frac{2}{3}L - 10$. We know that the number of leeches left is 10, so we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{2}{3}L - 10 = 10$$

Now, let's solve for L:

$$\frac{2}{3}L = 20$$

$$L = 20 \times \frac{3}{2}$$

$$L = 30$$

So, the initial number of leeches was 30. Therefore, the number of leeches left is:

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 500 - 60 \]
\[ J = 440 \]

Now, we can find the total expense for the two months:
\[ 2J + 60 = 2 \times 440 + 60 \]

polymath-low-bn-33,"The question is already in English. To answer it, we can use the following reasoning:

1. Let's denote the total number of gold ornaments as $G$.
2. Let's denote the total number of silver ornaments as $S$.
3. According to the problem, $G = 110$.
4. The problem states that the number of gold ornaments is 30 more than the number of silver ornaments. Therefore, we can write the equation: $G = S + 30$.
5. Substituting the value of $G$ from the first equation into the second equation, we get: $110 = S + 30$.
6. Solving for $S$, we get: $S = 110 - 30 = 80$.

John has sold his entire collection of 13 sets of Legos. He sells each set for $15. He bought 8 games for $20 each and still owes $5. How many Lego sets are left in his collection?

Let's break down the information given:

1. John has 13 sets of Legos.
2. He sells each set for $15.
3. He bought 8 games for $20 each.
4. He still owes $5.

To find out how many Lego sets are left, we need to calculate how much money John has earned from selling the Legos and then subtract the cost of the games he bought.

First, calculate the total money earned from selling the Legos:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times \$20 \text{ per game} = \$160 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the games from the money earned from selling the Legos to find out how much money John has left:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Since John still owes $5, we can determine how many sets he has left by dividing the remaining money by the cost per set:
\[ \frac{\$35}{\$15 \text{ per set}} = 2.33 \text{ sets} \]

Since John cannot have a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \]

To answer this question, we first need to calculate the total calories from the 5 bags of chips:

Next, we subtract the calories consumed from the daily goal to find out how many calories are left:

Now, we can find out how many grams of chips can be eaten with the remaining calories:

Since each bag is 300 grams, we can calculate the total grams of chips that can be eaten:

Before Candis left, he kept 80 post-it notes on his desk. When he arrived at the store, he bought one post-it note from the store; after that, he wrote a post-it note on each cup of coffee he bought (one post-it note per cup). If there are still 23 post-it notes left, how many post-it notes were on his bag?

To solve this, let's denote the number of post-it notes on his bag as \( x \). Initially, he had 80 post-it notes. When he bought one post-it note, he had 81 post-it notes. After writing post-it notes on the cups of coffee, he wrote \( x \) post-it notes on them. Therefore, the total number of post-it notes he had after buying the coffee and writing on the cups is \( 81 + x \). We know that after all this, he had 23 post-it notes left. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 81 + x = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 23 - 81 \]
\[ x = -58 \]

Since the number of post-it notes cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that after writing on the cups, he had 23 post-it notes left, which means he had 58 post-it notes before writing on the cups. Therefore, the correct equation should be:

\[ 81 + 58 = 23 \]

This equation is incorrect because it doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The correct interpretation should be that he had 81 post-it notes initially, wrote on the cups, and had 23 left, which means he had 58 post-it notes before writing on the cups. Therefore, the correct answer is:

2. The cost of a light blue shirt is $200 more than the cost of a dark blue shirt.
3. The cost of a light blue shirt is $40.

Let's denote the cost of a dark blue shirt as \( x \).

From the given information, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( 4x = 200 + x \) (since the cost of a light blue shirt is 4 times the cost of a dark blue shirt and $200 more)
2. \( 40 = x \) (since the cost of a light blue shirt is $40)

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. \( 4x = 200 + x \)
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides: \( 3x = 200 \)
   Divide by 3: \( x = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \)

2. \( 40 = x \)
   This equation confirms that the cost of a light blue shirt is $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the light blue shirts:

- Cost of 1 light blue shirt: $40
- Cost of 1 dark blue shirt: $66.67

Total cost of 1 light blue shirt and 1 dark blue shirt: \( 40 + 66.67 = 106.67 \)

Since the cost of a light blue shirt is 4 times the cost of a dark blue shirt, the total cost of 1 light blue shirt and 1 dark blue shirt is:

Question: Peter has planned to go to the cinema every week. He always spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn. If he has $42 at his disposal this week, how many times can he go to the cinema?

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so he spends $14 each time he goes to the cinema.
2. If he has $42 at his disposal, we need to find out how many times he can go to the cinema.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 14 \times \text{number of times} = 42 \]

To find the number of times, we divide both sides by $14:
\[ \text{number of times} = \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the cinema 3 times this week.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]",3,3
polymath-low-bn-57,"The question is in Bengali, and it asks about the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto a truck without exceeding its weight limit, given certain conditions.

1. The truck's maximum load capacity is 5000 pounds.
2. A box with a weight of 15 pounds can be loaded onto the truck.
3. The total weight of the truck and the empty box is 3755 pounds.
4. The truck's weight limit does not exceed 5000 pounds.

To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we first need to determine the weight of the empty truck. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty box from the total weight of the truck and the empty box:

Weight of the empty truck = Total weight of truck and empty box - Weight of the empty box
Weight of the empty truck = 3755 pounds - 15 pounds
Weight of the empty truck = 3740 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding its weight limit. This can be calculated by dividing the truck's maximum load capacity by the weight of a single box:

Number of boxes = Truck's maximum load capacity / Weight of a single box
Number of boxes = 5000 pounds / 15 pounds
Number of boxes = 333.33

Since we cannot load a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number:

Number of boxes = 333

Therefore, the answer is 333.",333,83

Each school also sends 5 players, so:

4 schools * 5 players/school = 20 players

polymath-low-bn-67,"The question is already in English. Now, let's solve it:

Let's denote the number of rupees (coins) as \( x \).

According to the problem:
1. There are 175 coins in total.
2. There are 35 fewer coins than the number of rupees.
3. The value of each coin is double the value of the rupees.

From the second point, we can write:
\[ x - 35 = 175 \]

From the third point, we can write:
\[ \text{Value of each coin} = 2 \times \text{Value of the rupees} \]

Since the total value of the coins is equal to the total value of the rupees, we can write:
\[ x \times (x - 35) = 2x \times 175 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ x^2 - 35x = 350x \]
\[ x^2 - 385x = 0 \]
\[ x(x - 385) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions: \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 385 \).

Since \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution in this context, we have:
\[ x = 385 \]

So, the total number of coins (and thus the total number of rupees) is \( \boxed{385} \).",385,595

1. Let the number of boys be \( B \) and the number of girls be \( G \).
2. According to the problem, \( B = 2G \).
3. We are given that \( G = 60 \).
4. Therefore, \( B = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
5. Let the usual number of students each teacher takes care of be \( S \).
6. With the new arrangement, each teacher takes care of \( S + 5 \) students.

To find the answer, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of flower and then sum them up.

1. **Lotus:**
   - Price per lotus: $2.74

Question: If we replace Remy with half of his weight and replace David with 4 times his weight, and if we replace David with 400 pounds, what is the difference in pounds between Remy and David's weights?

Let's denote:
- Remy's weight as \( R \)
- David's weight as \( D \)

According to the problem:
1. Remy's weight is replaced with half of his weight: \( \frac{R}{2} \)
2. David's weight is replaced with 4 times his weight: \( 4D \)
3. David's new weight is 400 pounds: \( 4D = 400 \)

From the third point, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 4D = 400 \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} \]
\[ D = 100 \]

So, David's original weight is 100 pounds. Now, we can find Remy's original weight using the second point:
\[ 4D = 400 \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} \]
\[ D = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in pounds between Remy and David's weights:
\[ \text{Difference} = R - D \]

Since Remy's weight is half of his original weight, we can express Remy's weight as:
\[ R = \frac{R}{2} \]

A football team has played 22 matches. The number of matches they have won is 8 more than the number of matches they have lost. How many total matches have they played?

To answer this question, let's denote:
- \( W \) as the number of matches won.
- \( L \) as the number of matches lost.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of matches played is 22.
2. The number of matches won is 8 more than the number of matches lost.

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( W \):
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

The total number of matches played is the sum of wins and losses:
\[ W + L = 15 + 7 = 22 \]

Translation:
A company gives each employee a monthly salary of $600. According to the company's policy, the starting salary of employees who have been with the company for 5 years will increase by 10% each year. If Shalini has been with the company for exactly 5 years, and then continues to work for another 3 years, what will her annual salary be at the end of 8 years?

Answer:
To calculate Shalini's annual salary after 8 years, we need to consider the following:

1. Her starting salary is $600.
2. Her salary will increase by 10% each year for the next 3 years.

Let's calculate the salary for each of the next 3 years:

- After the first year: $600 * 1.10 = $660
- After the second year: $660 * 1.10 = $726
- After the third year: $726 * 1.10 = $800

So, Shalini's annual salary after 8 years will be $800.

polymath-low-bn-88,"The question is already in English. Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Let's denote the number of records that Harry sold as \( x \).
2. According to the problem, Harry's records were sold 10 times more than Marilyn's records. So, Marilyn's records were sold \( \frac{x}{10} \).
3. The total number of records sold by both Harry and Marilyn is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{10} = 88,000
   \]
4. To solve this equation, we first find a common denominator for the terms on the left side:
   \[
   \frac{10x}{10} + \frac{x}{10} = 88,000
   \]
5. Combine the terms:
   \[
   \frac{11x}{10} = 88,000
   \]
6. To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 10:
   \[
   11x = 880,000
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   x = \frac{880,000}{11} = 80,000
   \]
8. So, Harry sold 80,000 records.

2. Calculate the number of teeth Mar has based on Sally's teeth.
3. Calculate the number of teeth Jerry has based on Mar's teeth.
4. Sum the total number of teeth for all three.

Step 1: Sally has 2 teeth.

Step 2: Mar has four more teeth than Sally:
Mar's teeth = Sally's teeth + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 teeth

Step 3: Mar has three times as many teeth as Jerry:
Jerry's teeth = Mar's teeth / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2 teeth

Step 4: Sum the total number of teeth for all three:
Total teeth = Sally's teeth + Mar's teeth + Jerry's teeth

Frederick used 8 kouati t'mets.

Translation:
When Freda made soot with kouati t'mets, it was half of what she made with kouati t'mets. She used three kouati t'mets in total. Freda made 32 kouati t'mets with the last batch.

To find out how many kouati t'mets Freda used, we can set up the equation:

Let x be the number of kouati t'mets used in the first batch. Then, the number of kouati t'mets used in the second batch is 2x (since it is half of the first batch), and the number of kouati t'mets used in the third batch is 4x (since it is double the second batch).

So, the total number of kouati t'mets used is:

x + 2x + 4x = 32

Combining like terms, we get:

7x = 32

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 32 / 7
x = 4.57 (approximately)

Since we can't use a fraction of a kouati t'met, we round down to the nearest whole number:

x = 4

So, Freda used 4 kouati t'mets in the first batch. The second batch would be 2 * 4 = 8 kouati t'mets, and the third batch would be 4 * 2 = 8 kouati t'mets.

Therefore, the total number of kouati t'mets used is:

4 + 8 + 8 = 20

However, this is not the correct answer because we need to account for the fact that the second batch is half of the first batch. So, we need to add the second batch back to the total:

20 + 8 = 28

20

This answer is derived from the information provided in the question. If the first day, 2 containers were filled with 5 cars each, then the total number of cars on the first day was 2 * 5 = 10 cars. On the second day, 30 cars were added to the total, so the number of cars filled on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20 cars.",20,4
polymath-low-bn-119,"The question has been translated to English as follows:

Adrian's total salary was 30% more than that of Layla. After four years, his salary increased, and he earned 40% more than what he earned four years ago. If Adrian and Layla's salaries increase by the same amount each year, and Layla earned $40,000 four years ago, how much will they both have after four years?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Layla's salary four years ago as \( L \).
2. Adrian's salary four years ago was \( L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
3. After four years, Layla's salary is \( L + 0.4L = 1.4L \).
4. After four years, Adrian's salary is \( 1.3L + 0.4(1.3L) = 1.3L + 0.52L = 1.82L \).
5. If their salaries increase by the same amount each year, after four years, their salaries will be \( 1.4L \) and \( 1.82L \) respectively.
6. The difference in their salaries after four years is \( 1.82L - 1.4L = 0.42L \).
7. Since Layla earned $40,000 four years ago, we can find \( L \) by dividing $40,000 by 1.4:
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.4} = 28571.43
   \]
8. Now, we can find their salaries after four years:
   \[
   \text{Layla's salary after four years} = 1.4L = 1.4 \times 28571.43 = 40000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Adrian's salary after four years} = 1.82L = 1.82 \times 28571.43 = 52000
   \]
9. The total amount they both have after four years is:
   \[
   40000 + 52000 = 92000
   \]

Therefore, the answer is $92000.",92000,95200

polymath-low-bn-122,"Question: On Sunday, Syad had 8 hours of sleep. The next two days, he slept 2 hours less each day because he had to finish some assignments. If he slept 1 hour more than the usual for the remaining 7 days of the week, how much total sleep did he get in a week?

Answer: Let's denote the usual number of hours of sleep as \( x \). According to the problem, on Sunday, Syad slept 8 hours, and on the next two days, he slept \( x - 2 \) hours each day. For the remaining 7 days, he slept \( x + 1 \) hours each day. The total sleep for the week can be expressed as:

\[ 8 + 2(x - 2) + 7(x + 1) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ 8 + 2x - 4 + 7x + 7 = 9x + 11 \]

Since the total sleep for the week is the sum of the sleep on Sunday and the sleep on the next two days, we can set up the equation:

\[ 8 + 2(x - 2) = 9x + 11 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + 2x - 4 = 9x + 11 \]
\[ 4 + 2x = 9x + 11 \]
\[ 2x - 9x = 11 - 4 \]
\[ -7x = 7 \]
\[ x = -1 \]

This result doesn't make sense in the context of sleep hours, so let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the total sleep for the week as the sum of the sleep on Sunday and the sleep on the next two days, which is 8 hours, and the sleep on the remaining 7 days, which is \( 7(x + 1) \). The total sleep for the week is:

mgsm-bn-192,"The question is already in English, so no translation is needed. Now, let's solve the problem:

1. First, we need to determine how many trees Tama has after 10 years. He starts with 50 trees and adds 10 trees each year, but also loses 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

2. After 10 years, the number of trees he has is:
\[ 50 + 10 \times 8 = 50 + 80 = 130 \]

3. After 10 years, 30% of the trees have been lost, so 70% of the trees remain. The number of trees after 10 years is 70% of 130:
\[ 130 \times 0.7 = 91 \]

4. Now, we need to find out how many trees he has after another 10 years. He adds 10 trees each year and loses 2 trees each year, so the net increase is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per 10 years.

5. After another 10 years, the number of trees he has is:
\[ 91 + 10 \times 8 = 91 + 80 = 171 \]

Therefore, the answer is 171 trees.",171,91

mgsm-bn-194,"The question is in Bengali, and it translates to English as:

""Bagels are new to him. He wants to buy 5 different colored ones and spent $20 on them. How much money will he earn?""

To answer this question, we need to calculate how much money Bagels will earn by selling the 5 different colored bagels at a price of $2 each.

Let's assume the colors of the bagels are A, B, C, D, and E. The total cost for 5 different colored bagels is $20.

The total number of bagels is 5.

The price per bagel is $2.

The total earnings can be calculated as follows:
Total earnings = Number of bagels * Price per bagel

Let's calculate the total earnings:

Total earnings = 5 bagels * $2 per bagel
Total earnings = $10

So, Bagels will earn $10 by selling the 5 different colored bagels at $2 each.",2,10

Elaine initially had 20 cards in the first month. In the second month, she doubled the number of cards. In the third month, she subtracted 20 cards from the number she had in the first month. In the fourth month, she doubled the total number of cards she had in the first three months. How many cards does she have in total?

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **First month:** Elaine has 20 cards.
2. **Second month:** She doubles the number of cards, so she has $20 \times 2 = 40$ cards.
3. **Third month:** She subtracts 20 cards from the number she had in the first month, so she has $20 - 20 = 0$ cards.
4. **Fourth month:** She doubles the total number of cards she had in the first three months, which is $0 + 20 + 40 = 60$ cards. Then she doubles that, so she has $60 \times 2 = 120$ cards.

mgsm-bn-200,"The question is already in English. Here is the answer:

To calculate the total liters of water the boy collects in a day, we need to consider the amount of water he collects during the day and the amount he collects at night.

During the day, he collects water in the morning (5 times) and in the evening (6 times). So, the total liters of water collected during the day is:

\[ 5 \text{ times} + 6 \text{ times} = 11 \text{ times} \]

Since each collection is 5 liters, the total liters of water collected during the day is:

\[ 11 \text{ times} \times 5 \text{ liters/time} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

At night, he collects water in the evening (6 times) and in the morning (5 times). So, the total liters of water collected at night is:

\[ 6 \text{ times} + 5 \text{ times} = 11 \text{ times} \]

Since each collection is 5 liters, the total liters of water collected at night is:

\[ 11 \text{ times} \times 5 \text{ liters/time} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total liters of water collected in a day is:

\[ 55 \text{ liters} + 55 \text{ liters} = 110 \text{ liters} \]

So, the answer is 110 liters.",110,55

1. **Ros went to the Rose bakery on Monday and bought 4 cakes.**
2. **On Tuesday, she bought 3 times as many cakes as on Monday.**

We need to calculate the total number of cakes Ros bought over these three days.

Let's denote:
- The number of cakes bought on Monday as \( C_{\text{Monday}} \).
- The number of cakes bought on Tuesday as \( C_{\text{Tuesday}} \).
- The number of cakes bought on Wednesday as \( C_{\text{Wednesday}} \).

Given:
- \( C_{\text{Monday}} = 4 \)
- \( C_{\text{Tuesday}} = 3 \times C_{\text{Monday}} \)
- \( C_{\text{Wednesday}} = 5 \times C_{\text{Tuesday}} \)

First, calculate \( C_{\text{Tuesday}} \):
\[ C_{\text{Tuesday}} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Next, calculate \( C_{\text{Wednesday}} \):
\[ C_{\text{Wednesday}} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, sum up the total number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[ \text{Total} = C_{\text{Monday}} + C_{\text{Tuesday}} + C_{\text{Wednesday}} \]

""Adrian's age is three times Hyrte's age, and Hyrte's age is half of Jek's age. If Hyrte's age is now 21 years, what will be the average age of the three people three years later?""

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's denote Hyrte's current age as H.
2. According to the problem, H = 21 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Hyrte's age, so Adrian's age is 3 * H = 3 * 21 = 63 years.
4. Hyrte's age is half of Jek's age, so Jek's age is 2 * H = 2 * 21 = 42 years.
5. Three years later, Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.
6. Three years later, Hyrte's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years.
7. Three years later, Jek's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years.
8. To find the average age of the three people three years later, we add their ages and divide by 3:
   (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

Therefore, the answer is 45 years.",45,45

In a game of board games, 4 students scored a total of 251 points. Nancy scored 68 points. Brian scored 10 more points than Nancy, and Bryan scored 17 more points than Nancy. How many points did Joe score?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the points scored by Joe. Let's denote the points scored by Joe as \( x \).

Given:
- Nancy's points: \( 68 \)
- Brian's points: \( 68 + 10 = 78 \)
- Bryan's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

The total points scored by all students is 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 68 + 78 + 85 = 251 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 231 = 251 \]
\[ x = 251 - 231 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Joe scored \( \boxed{20} \) points.",20,54

1. Calculate the time spent on one type of problem:
   - Shabda chak: 10 minutes

2. Calculate the total time spent on all problems:
   - Shabda chak: 3 problems * 10 minutes = 30 minutes
   - Sudook: 8 problems * 5 minutes = 40 minutes

3. Add the times together to get the total time spent:
   - Total time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 70 minutes = 70 / 60 hours = 1.1667 hours

5. Calculate the total cost:
   - Shabda chak: 3 problems * 1000 rupees = 3000 rupees
   - Sudook: 8 problems * 500 rupees = 4000 rupees

To answer the question, we need to calculate the probability that a card chosen at random from the remaining cards is a ""Watch"" card.

Initially, there are 30 ""Fork"" cards, 20 ""Glass"" cards, and 40 ""Watch"" cards, making a total of 90 cards.

After removing 8 ""Watch"" cards and 14 ""Glass"" cards, the remaining number of cards is:
- 30 ""Fork"" cards

So, the total number of remaining cards is 30 + 20 + 26 = 76 cards.

Question: Keith and Robert go to the zoo. On Monday, Robert collected 20 butterflies and Keith collected 5 more butterflies than Robert. On Tuesday, Keith collected 2 times as many butterflies as he did on Monday and Robert collected 2 more butterflies than he did on Monday. How many butterflies did Keith collect on Tuesday?

Answer: Let's denote the number of butterflies Keith collected on Monday as \( K_{Monday} \) and the number of butterflies Robert collected on Monday as \( R_{Monday} \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R_{Monday} = 20 \)
2. \( K_{Monday} = R_{Monday} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \)

On Tuesday:
- Keith collected \( 2 \times K_{Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) butterflies.
- Robert collected \( R_{Monday} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \) butterflies.

So, Keith collected 50 butterflies on Tuesday.

Question: Dax ate some apples from the basket and saw half as many peaches as apples in the garden. If there are 50 peaches in the garden, how many fruits are there in total?

Answer: Let's denote the number of apples as A and the number of peaches as P. According to the problem, we have:

1. P = A/2 (half as many peaches as apples)
2. P = 50 (there are 50 peaches)

From equation 2, we can find the number of apples:

50 = A/2
A = 50 * 2
A = 100

Now we can find the total number of fruits in the garden:

Total fruits = A + P
Total fruits = 100 + 50
Total fruits = 150

There are 36 pangolin skins in the cage. One-third of them were stolen, and the rest were eaten by the sea. The rest of the pangolins were inside the cave at night. How many pangolins were still alive?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, there are 36 pangolins.
2. One-third of them were stolen, so we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   Therefore, 12 pangolins were stolen.
3. The rest of the pangolins were eaten by the sea, so we subtract the stolen pangolins from the initial count:
   \[
   36 - 12 = 24
   \]
   This means 24 pangolins were eaten by the sea.
4. The rest of the pangolins were inside the cave at night, so we have:
   \[
   24
   \]
   pangolins still alive.

Therefore, the answer is $24$.",24,12
mgsm-bn-234,"The answer is 10.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. **Daily consumption**: The person eats 6 times a day.
2. **Weekly consumption**: There are 7 days in a week, so the person eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) times in a week.
3. **Weekly consumption per meal**: The person eats 3 times a meal, so the person eats \(42 \div 3 = 14\) meals in a week.
4. **Weekly consumption per day**: There are 7 days in a week, so the person eats \(14 \div 7 = 2\) meals per day.
5. **Weekly consumption per week**: The person eats 2 meals per day for 7 days, so the person eats \(2 \times 7 = 14\) meals per week.
6. **Weekly consumption per week**: The person eats 14 meals per week, so the person eats \(14 \div 7 = 2\) meals per day.

1. Let the original price of the house be \( P \).
2. According to the problem, the house was sold for \( 50,000 \) dollars.
3. The house was sold at a 150% increase from its original price, so the selling price is \( P + 1.5P = 2.5P \).
4. We know the selling price is \( 50,000 \) dollars, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2.5P = 50,000
   \]
5. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{50,000}{2.5} = 20,000
   \]
   So, the original price of the house was \( 20,000 \) dollars.
6. The house was bought for \( 80,000 \) dollars and sold for \( 50,000 \) dollars, so the profit is:
   \[
   50,000 - 80,000 = -30,000

To calculate the total cost, we first find the price per second blanket:

Price per second blanket = Original price * 60%
Price per second blanket = $5 * 0.60
Price per second blanket = $3

Now, we multiply this price by the number of blankets Kailash wants to buy:

Answer: The man is $120$ miles away from the house at the end of 4 hours.

To arrive at this answer, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey:

1. In the first 2 hours, the man travels at 30 miles per hour, so he covers $2 \times 30 = 60$ miles.
2. In the next 2 hours, he travels at 80 miles per hour, so he covers $2 \times 80 = 160$ miles.
3. The total distance covered in 4 hours is $60 + 160 = 220$ miles.

Since he started 60 miles away from the house, the distance from the house at the end of 4 hours is $220 - 60 = 160$ miles. However, this is the distance from the house to the point where he stopped, not the distance from the house to the point where he is at the end of the journey. To find the distance from the house to the final point, we need to add the distance he traveled in the last 2 hours, which is $2 \times 80 = 160$ miles.

Therefore, the total distance from the house to the final point is $60 + 160 + 160 = 380$ miles. However, this is the distance from the house to the point where he stopped, not the distance from the house to the point where he is at the end of the journey. To find the distance from the house to the final point, we need to subtract the distance he traveled in the last 2 hours, which is $2 \times 80 = 160$ miles.

Therefore, the total distance from the house to the final point is $60 + 160 + 160 = 380$ miles.

To answer the question: 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Work**: Eliza works 40 hours a day at a rate of $10 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Daily Work} = 40 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400/\text{day}
   \]

2. **Extra Hours**: Eliza works an extra 5 hours each day (40 - 35 = 5).
   \[
   \text{Extra Hours} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. **Extra Rate**: The extra rate is 1.2 times the daily rate.
   \[
   \text{Extra Rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour}
   \]

4. **Total Extra Work**: Eliza works 45 hours in the week (5 extra hours/day for 9 days).
   \[
   \text{Total Extra Work} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 9 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Total Extra Pay**: Calculate the total extra pay based on the extra rate.
   \[
   \text{Total Extra Pay} = 45 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$540
   \]

6. **Total Weekly Pay**: Add the daily work pay to the extra pay.
   \[
   \text{Total Weekly Pay} = \$400/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} + \$540 = \$2800 + \$540 = \$3340
   \]

Therefore, Eliza's weekly pay for the week she works 45 hours is $\boxed{3340}$.",3340,460

Melaan sold 1/3 of his green house, 2 red houses, and the remaining half of his orchard house. If he had 5 remaining houses, how many houses did he sell initially?

Let's denote the total number of houses Melaan initially had as \( H \).

According to the problem:
- He sold 1/3 of his green houses, which is \( \frac{1}{3}H \).
- He sold 2 red houses.
- He sold half of his orchard house, which is \( \frac{1}{2}H \).

The total number of houses he sold is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}H + 2 + \frac{1}{2}H \]

The remaining houses are 5, so the total number of houses \( H \) is:
\[ H = \frac{1}{3}H + 2 + \frac{1}{2}H + 5 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ H = \frac{5}{6}H + 7 \]

To solve for \( H \):
\[ H - \frac{5}{6}H = 7 \]
\[ \frac{1}{6}H = 7 \]
\[ H = 7 \times 6 \]
\[ H = 42 \]

So, Melaan initially had 42 houses. Now, let's find out how many houses he sold initially:
\[ \text{Houses sold initially} = \frac{1}{3}H + 2 + \frac{1}{2}H \]
\[ = \frac{1}{3} \times 42 + 2 + \frac{1}{2} \times 42 \]
\[ = 14 + 2 + 21 \]
\[ = 37 \]

Therefore, Melaan sold 37 houses initially.",37,18

Let's denote the number of gowns bought as \( x \) and the number of electronic gadgets bought as \( y \).

The total cost of gowns is \( 5000x \) and the total cost of electronic gadgets is \( 8000y \).

The total cost is \( 5000x + 8000y \).

The total revenue from gowns is \( 5000 \times 1.025x = 5000 \times 1.025x = 5125x \) and the total revenue from electronic gadgets is \( 8000 \times 1.012y = 8000 \times 1.012y = 8096y \).

The total revenue is \( 5125x + 8096y \).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is \( (5125x + 8096y) - (5000x + 8000y) = 125x - 84y \).

To maximize the profit, we need to maximize \( 125x - 84y \).

Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, the maximum value of \( x \) is 100 (because \( 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \), which is less than 10000).

The maximum value of \( y \) is 100 (because \( 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \), which is less than 10000).

So, the maximum profit is \( 125 \times 100 - 84 \times 100 = 12500 - 8400 = 4100 \).

Therefore, the answer is $4100.",4100,125

Question: Maria drives 12 miles. In the first part, she drives 4 miles at a speed of 1 mile per hour, and in the second part, she drives 2 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour. If she wants to drive at an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trip, how fast should she drive the remaining distance?

Answer: The total distance driven is 12 miles. The first part of the trip is 4 miles at 1 mile per hour, so it takes 4 hours. The second part is 2 miles at 2 miles per hour, so it takes 1 hour. The total time for the trip is 4 + 1 = 5 hours. To drive at an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trip, the remaining distance should be 4 * 5 = 20 miles. The remaining distance is 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 miles. Therefore, she should drive at a speed of 6 miles per hour for the remaining distance.

""কাইল গত বছরের সবথেকে বেশি বিক্রয় হওয়া বইটি $19.50 মূল্যে কিনেছিলেন। যা আসল মূল্যের ওপর 25% ছাড়ে পাওয়া গিয়েছিল। বইটির আসল মূল্য কত ছিল?""

The English translation is:
""Kail last year sold a book at a price that was $19.50 more than its actual price, which was 25% less than the actual price. What was the actual price of the book?""

To solve this, let's denote the actual price of the book as \( P \).

According to the problem, the selling price is \( P - 0.25P = 0.75P \).

We know that the selling price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

Now, we solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the actual price of the book is $26.

\[ \boxed{26} \]",26,26

The total cost for the pie orders is \( 8.50x \) dollars.

The total cost for all items is given as $50. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.50x + 36 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 10x + 36 = 50 \]

Subtract 36 from both sides:

\[ 10x = 14 \]

Divide by 10:

\[ x = 1.4 \]

Since the number of orders must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

Finally, she bought a pair of shoes for $20. She also bought a hat for $5. If she had a $100 discount on the total bill, how much did the hat cost?

Let's break down the costs:

So, the final cost after the discount is $280 - $100 = $180.

Now, let's find the cost of the hat:

Total cost of jacket, shoes, and socks: $200 + $20 + $10 + $20 + $10 = $260

Answer: Let's denote the number of gold rings as G and the number of silver rings as S. According to the problem:

1. G = 110 (There are 110 gold rings in Greece)
2. G = S + 30 (The number of gold rings is 30 more than the number of silver rings)

We can substitute the value of G from the first equation into the second equation:

110 = S + 30

Now, solve for S:

S = 110 - 30
S = 80

So, there are 80 silver rings in Greece.

To find the number of gold rings, we can use the first equation:

G = 110

Therefore, there are 110 gold rings in Greece.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of rings Arun has.
- \( B \) as the number of rings Ben has.
- \( R \) as the number of rings Remind has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arun has 2 rings less than Ben: \( A = B - 2 \).
2. The average number of rings Remind has is 5 more than the average number of rings Arun has: \( \frac{R}{2} = \frac{A + B}{2} + 5 \).
3. Remind has 40 rings: \( R = 40 \).

We need to find the number of rings Ben has, \( B \).

First, substitute \( R = 40 \) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = \frac{A + B}{2} + 5 \]
\[ 20 = \frac{A + B}{2} + 5 \]
\[ 20 - 5 = \frac{A + B}{2} \]
\[ 15 = \frac{A + B}{2} \]
\[ A + B = 30 \]

Now, substitute \( A = B - 2 \) into the equation \( A + B = 30 \):
\[ (B - 2) + B = 30 \]
\[ 2B - 2 = 30 \]
\[ 2B = 32 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

So, Ben has \( 16 \) rings.

Question: John has sold his entire collection of video games. He plans to buy video games for $20 with 8 games at $20 each. He still has $5 left. How many more game sets does he have?

To solve this, let's first calculate how much money John has spent on the video games and how much he has left after buying them.

He has 8 games at $20 each, so he has spent:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

He still has $5 left, so the total amount of money he had initially was:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more game sets he has. Since he has 13 sets of games and has spent $160, we can calculate the number of sets left by dividing the total amount of money he had by the cost of one set:
\[ \frac{165}{15} = 11 \text{ sets} \]

So, John has 11 more game sets left.

The final answer is $11$.",11,2

Question: Dhana can run at a speed that is four times faster than walking, but she can run at half the speed of walking. If she can run 3 miles in an hour, how many miles can she cover in 7 hours if she runs half the speed and walks the other half?

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Dhana's running speed is four times her walking speed.
2. Dhana's walking speed is half of her running speed.
3. Dhana runs 3 miles in an hour.

First, we need to find Dhana's walking speed:
- Dhana's running speed = 4 * Dhana's walking speed
- Dhana's walking speed = Dhana's running speed / 4
- Dhana's walking speed = 3 miles / 4 = 0.75 miles per hour

Next, we find Dhana's running speed:
- Dhana's running speed = 3 miles per hour

Now, we need to calculate how many miles Dhana can cover in 7 hours if she runs half the speed and walks the other half:
- Half of Dhana's running speed = 3 miles / 2 = 1.5 miles per hour
- Half of Dhana's walking speed = 0.75 miles / 2 = 0.375 miles per hour

Total distance covered in 7 hours:
- Distance = (1.5 miles/hour + 0.375 miles/hour) * 7 hours
- Distance = (1.875 miles/hour) * 7 hours
- Distance = 13.125 miles

John, a mango seller, bought 5 apples for 25 rupees. He cut each apple into 8 pieces and arranged 5 apples on 5 plates for guests. After the guests finished eating their apples, there were 14 pieces left. How many pieces of apple did the guests eat?

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. John bought 5 apples for 25 rupees.
2. Each apple is cut into 8 pieces, so 5 apples would be cut into \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pieces.
3. He arranged 5 apples on 5 plates, so each plate has 8 pieces of apple.
4. After the guests finished eating, there were 14 pieces left.

Let's denote the number of pieces of apple eaten by the guests as \(x\).

The total number of pieces of apple before the guests ate any was 40. After the guests ate \(x\) pieces, there were 14 pieces left. So, the equation representing this situation is:
\[40 - x = 14\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[40 - x = 14\]
\[40 - 14 = x\]
\[x = 26\]

So, the guests ate 26 pieces of apple.

According to current data, a bag contains 250 calories per chip. If a bag contains 300 grams and your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and you consume 1800 calories by the end of the day, how many grams of chips can you eat?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total number of chips consumed and then determine how many grams of chips that corresponds to.

1. **Calculate the total number of chips consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Total chips consumed} = \frac{\text{Total calories consumed}}{\text{Calories per chip}} = \frac{1800 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per chip}} = 7.2 \text{ chips}

2. **Calculate the total number of grams of chips consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Total grams of chips consumed} = \text{Total chips consumed} \times \text{Grams per chip} = 7.2 \text{ chips} \times 300 \text{ grams per chip} = 2160 \text{ grams}

Let's break it down:

1. Charles can make 10 teapods per pound of mom.
2. The cost of 1 pound of mom is $10.00.
3. Charles sells each teapod for $2.00.

First, calculate the cost of 1 pound of mom:
\[ \text{Cost of 1 pound of mom} = \$10.00 \]

Next, calculate the revenue from selling 10 teapods per pound:
\[ \text{Revenue from 10 teapods} = 10 \text{ teapods} \times \$2.00 \text{ per teapod} = \$20.00 \]

Now, calculate the profit from selling 10 teapods:
\[ \text{Profit from 10 teapods} = \$20.00 - \$10.00 = \$10.00 \]

Since Charles makes 10 teapods per pound and sells each for $2.00, he will make a profit of $10.00 for each pound of mom he sells. 

Now, calculate the total profit for 20 teapods:
\[ \text{Total profit for 20 teapods} = 20 \text{ teapods} \times \$10.00 \text{ profit per pound} = \$200.00 \]

Therefore, the total profit Charles makes from selling 20 teapods is $200.00.",0,20

To answer this, let's denote the ages of Maria, Jeane, and Jess as \( M \), \( J \), and \( S \) respectively.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( M = \frac{1}{2} J \)
2. \( J = \frac{1}{2} S \)
3. \( S = 20 \)

First, we find Jess's age:
\[ S = 20 \]

Next, we find Jeane's age using Jess's age:
\[ J = \frac{1}{2} S = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Then, we find Maria's age using Jeane's age:
\[ M = \frac{1}{2} J = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the ages of the three girls:

- Let \( J \) be the number of cookies John has.
- Let \( I \) be the number of cookies James has.

From the problem, we have the following information:

2. \( J = R + 6 \) (James has 6 more cookies than Robert)
3. \( J = 54 \) (John has 54 cookies)

First, we can use the information that John has 54 cookies to find out how many cookies Robert has:
\[ J = 54 \]
\[ 2R = 54 \]
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ R = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 cookies. Next, we need to find out how many cookies James has:
\[ J = R + 6 \]
\[ J = 27 + 6 \]
\[ J = 33 \]

So, James has 33 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many more cookies John has than James:

mgsm-bn-245,"The question translates to English as follows:

In a fishery, there are 4 sharks and another fishery has 32 sharks. The difference between the number of sharks in the two fisheries is twice the difference between the number of fish in each fishery. If both fisheries have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each fishery?

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of fish in each fishery.
- \( y \) as the number of sharks in each fishery.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of sharks in both fisheries is 36 (since 4 + 32 = 36).
2. The difference between the number of sharks in the two fisheries is twice the difference between the number of fish in each fishery.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ y + y = 36 \]
\[ 2(y - y) = 2 \times 0 \]

However, this interpretation seems incorrect because it does not account for the difference in sharks. Let's correct it:

1. The difference between the number of sharks in the two fisheries is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
2. The difference between the number of fish in each fishery is \( x - x = 0 \).

Given that the difference between the number of sharks is twice the difference between the number of fish, we have:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 0 \]

This interpretation is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate:

1. The total number of sharks is 36.
2. The difference between the number of sharks in the two fisheries is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
3. The difference between the number of fish in each fishery is \( x - x = 0 \).

mgsm-bn-246,"### English Translation
The actor works 250 hours per week. For a movie, he needs a lot of makeup, and it takes him 6 hours a day to do it, and he does it 7 days a week. The movie ends in 5 weeks. To finish the job, the makeup artist gives the actor a 10% discount. How many days did the actor work?

### Answer
Let's denote the number of days the actor worked as \( x \).

The total number of hours worked by the actor is:
\[ 250 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 1250 \text{ hours} \]

Since the makeup artist works 6 hours a day for 7 days a week, the total number of hours worked by the makeup artist is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ hours/week} \]

The total number of hours worked by the actor and the makeup artist is:
\[ 1250 \text{ hours} + 42 \text{ hours} = 1292 \text{ hours} \]

Since the makeup artist gives the actor a 10% discount, the actor's pay is reduced by 10%. Therefore, the actor's pay is:
\[ 1292 \text{ hours} \times (1 - 0.10) = 1292 \text{ hours} \times 0.90 = 1162.8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the actor works 250 hours per week, the number of weeks the actor worked is:
\[ \frac{1162.8 \text{ hours}}{250 \text{ hours/week}} = 4.6512 \text{ weeks} \]

Since the actor works 7 days a week, the number of days the actor worked is:
\[ 4.6512 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 32.5584 \text{ days} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the actor worked:
\[ \boxed{33} \text{ days} \]",33,27000

Jeneth eats 16 ears of corn per day. He eats 3 ears of corn for breakfast and gives 2 ears of corn to his friends every day. The remaining corn he sells at the market at $2 per ear. How much does he sell at the market per day?

To find out how much he sells at the market per day, we need to calculate how many ears of corn he has left after eating and giving away some. Then we multiply that number by the price per ear.

First, let's calculate how many ears of corn he has left:

1. He eats 3 ears for breakfast.
2. He gives 2 ears to his friends.
3. He eats 16 ears per day.

So, the total ears of corn he eats per day is 3 + 2 + 16 = 21 ears.

Now, we subtract the ears he eats from the total he has:

21 ears (total) - 21 ears (eaten) = 0 ears (remaining).

Since he has 0 ears of corn left, he does not sell any at the market.

Answer in English: 
Let's calculate the cost of each pair of socks and then the total cost for 16 pairs.

1. The cost of the first pair of socks is $5.
2. The cost of the second pair of socks is $5 * 1.60 = $8.
3. The cost of the third pair of socks is $8 * 1.60 = $12.80.
4. The cost of the fourth pair of socks is $12.80 * 1.60 = $20.48.
5. The cost of the fifth pair of socks is $20.48 * 1.60 = $32.768.

Now, we add up the costs of all 16 pairs of socks:
$5 + $8 + $12.80 + $20.48 + $32.768 = $79.048.

Explanation:
Let's denote the number of beds Charles has as \( C \), the number of beds Sally has as \( S \), and the number of beds Tom has as \( T \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( T = C + 4 \) (Tom has two more beds than Charles)
2. \( S = 2T \) (Sally has twice as many beds as Tom)
3. \( S = 20 \) (Sally has 20 beds)

Using the third piece of information, we can find the number of beds Tom has:
\[ S = 20 \]
\[ T = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, using the second piece of information, we can find the number of beds Sally has:
\[ S = 2T \]
\[ 20 = 2T \]
\[ T = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Finally, using the first piece of information, we can find the number of beds Charles has:
\[ T = C + 4 \]
\[ 10 = C + 4 \]
\[ C = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Now we can calculate the total number of beds:
\[ T + C + S = 10 + 6 + 20 = 36 \]

So, the total number of beds is \( 36 \).",36,260

Now, let's calculate the total number of downloads over the three months:

Total downloads = First month downloads + Second month downloads + Third month downloads
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126
Total downloads = 366

Here's the reasoning:

1. Charles needs to buy a tree for $90.
2. He can plant 7 trees per year, and each tree costs $1.5.
3. The cost of planting 7 trees is $1.5 * 7 = $10.5.
4. The remaining amount for the tree is $90 - $10.5 = $79.5.
5. The cost of watering the tree is $3 per year.
6. To find the number of years it takes to plant and water the tree, we divide the remaining amount by the cost per year: $79.5 / $3 = 26.5 years.
7. Since he can't plant a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 27 years.

Therefore, it will take Charles 27 years to plant and water the tree.",27,13

To find out how far each train traveled in two days, we need to calculate the distance each train covered in one day and then double it.

First, calculate the distance covered by one train in one day:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{80 \text{ miles}}{2} = 40 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, double this distance to find the total distance covered in two days:

Question: Maria drives 12 miles. In the first part, she drives 4 miles at a speed of 1 mile per hour, and in the second part, she drives 2 miles at a speed of 2 miles per hour. If she wants to average 4 miles per hour over the entire journey, how fast must she drive the remaining 4 miles?

Answer: Let's denote the speed for the remaining 4 miles as \( v \) miles per hour. The total time for the journey is the sum of the times for each part of the journey. The time for the first part is \( \frac{4}{1} = 4 \) hours, and the time for the second part is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour. The total time is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) hours. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. We want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour, so we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{12}{5} = 4
\]

This equation is not correct because the average speed is not 4 miles per hour. Instead, we need to find the speed \( v \) such that the total time is 5 hours. The time for the remaining 4 miles is \( \frac{4}{v} \). The total time is the sum of the times for each part of the journey:

\[
\frac{4}{1} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{4}{v} = 5

\[
4 + 1 + \frac{4}{v} = 5
\]

\[
5 + \frac{4}{v} = 5
\]

\[
\frac{4}{v} = 0
\]

This equation is incorrect because it implies that the speed is infinite. Instead, we need to find the speed \( v \) such that the total time is 5 hours. The time for the remaining 4 miles is \( \frac{4}{v} \). The total time is the sum of the times for each part of the journey:

\[

""In my possession, there is 10 liters of orange juice, two-thirds of which is water. I want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice, which contains five-sixths of water. However, when I mix them, I take out one liter of orange juice. What is the remaining volume of water?""

Answer:
Let's denote the volume of orange juice as \( O \) and the volume of pineapple juice as \( P \). We know that \( O = 10 \) liters and \( P = 15 \) liters. The volume of water in orange juice is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters, and the volume of water in pineapple juice is \( \frac{5}{6} \times 15 = \frac{75}{6} = \frac{25}{2} \) liters. Therefore, the total volume of water in the mixture is \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{25}{2} = \frac{40 + 75}{6} = \frac{115}{6} \) liters.

When we mix the two liquids, we take out one liter of orange juice, so the remaining volume of orange juice is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters. The remaining volume of water in the mixture is \( \frac{115}{6} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{115 - 40}{6} = \frac{75}{6} = 12.5 \) liters.

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total cost of the chocolates and milk, then subtract this from the total amount made to find the cost of the cookies. Finally, we divide the cost of the cookies by the price per box to find the number of boxes bought.

Let's break it down:

1. Cost of chocolates: \(12 \times 1.20 = 14.40\) dollars
2. Cost of milk: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars
3. Total cost of chocolates and milk: \(14.40 + 15 = 29.40\) dollars
4. Total amount made: $50
5. Cost of cookies: \(50 - 29.40 = 20.60\) dollars
6. Number of boxes of cookies: \(20.60 / 8.50 = 2.4\) boxes

Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, the man bought 2 boxes of cookies.

polymath-low-bn-29,"The question is in Bengali. Let's translate it to English:

Question: Glorieux is buying a bike. He saw a helmet and a pair of gloves for $20 together. However, he needs to buy a helmet and a pair of gloves that cost $20 together. If one helmet costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how much does the bike cost?

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Let the cost of the helmet be \( H \) and the cost of the gloves be \( G \).
2. We know that \( H + G = 20 \) (the cost of the helmet and gloves).
3. We also know that \( H = 33 \) and \( G = 2 \times 33 = 66 \).
4. Substitute \( H \) and \( G \) into the equation \( H + G = 20 \):
   \[
   33 + G = 20
   \]
5. Solve for \( G \):
   \[
   G = 20 - 33 = -13
   \]
6. This result is incorrect because the cost of gloves cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since the cost of the helmet and gloves is $20, and the helmet costs $33, the gloves must cost $33 - $20 = $13.

Now, let's find the cost of the bike:
1. The cost of the helmet is $33.
2. The cost of the gloves is $13.
3. The cost of the bike is the sum of the cost of the helmet and the gloves:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the bike} = 33 + 13 = 46
   \]

Therefore, the cost of the bike is $46.",46,104
polymath-low-bn-30,"The question is already in English. Here is the translation and the answer:

The ratio of the ages of Darrel and Alan is 7:11. If their combined age is now 162 years, what will be Alan's age 10 years from now?

Let's denote Darrel's current age as 7x and Alan's current age as 11x. The sum of their ages is given by:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Solving for x:

\[ 18x = 162 \]
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Darrel's current age is \( 7 \times 9 = 63 \) years, and Alan's current age is \( 11 \times 9 = 99 \) years.

In 10 years, Alan's age will be \( 99 + 10 = 109 \) years.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{109} \).",109,109

The question is about the average number of villages in the forest that Gunter is keeping track of. The first person said there are 80 villages, the second person said there are half as many as the first person plus 20, and the third person said there are 25% more than the first person. The average of these three numbers is $200$.

The answer is $200$.",200,80
