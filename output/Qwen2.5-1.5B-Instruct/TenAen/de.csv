1. **Determine the cost of the blue krawattas:**
   - John spent $200 on blue krawattas.
   - Each blue krawattas costs $40.
   - Number of blue krawattas = $200 / $40 = 5.

2. **Calculate the cost of the red krawattas:**
   - John bought twice as many red krawattas as blue krawattas.
   - Number of red krawattas = 2 * 5 = 10.
   - Each red krawattas costs 50% more than each blue krawattas.
   - Cost of each red krawattas = $40 * 1.5 = $60.
   - Total cost of red krawattas = 10 * $60 = $600.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Cost of blue krawattas + Cost of red krawattas.
   - Total amount spent = $200 + $600 = $800.

Therefore, the total amount John spent on krawattas is $800. 

The final answer is: $800.",800,800

mgsm-de-49,"The question translates to:

""Richard lives in a house with 15 floors. On each floor, there are 8 apartments, and 3/4 of the building is inhabited. How many apartments in the building are unoccupied in total?""

To find the number of unoccupied apartments, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the building.
2. Determine how many apartments are occupied.
3. Subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of unoccupied apartments.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments.
The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments.
\[
\text{Total number of apartments} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Step 2: Determine how many apartments are occupied.
3/4 of the building is inhabited, so we calculate 3/4 of the total number of apartments.
\[
\text{Number of occupied apartments} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of unoccupied apartments.
\[
\text{Number of unoccupied apartments} = 120 - 90 = 30
\]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied apartments in the building is $30$.",30,30

To find out how long it takes for the return trip, we need to calculate the distance Tom travels and then divide it by his driving speed.

First, calculate the distance Tom travels while sailing:
\[ \text{Distance while sailing} = \text{Speed while sailing} \times \text{Time while sailing} \]
\[ \text{Distance while sailing} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance while sailing} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Next, calculate the time it takes for Tom to drive back:
\[ \text{Time while driving} = \frac{\text{Distance while sailing}}{\text{Speed while driving}} \]
\[ \text{Time while driving} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time while driving} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, add the time spent sailing and driving to get the total time for the return trip:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time while sailing} + \text{Time while driving} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

mgsm-de-52,"English translation: Uriah's book bag is too heavy. He needs to take out 15 pounds. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he takes out 30 comic books, how many more toys does he need to take out?

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find out how much weight Uriah is taking out by taking comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, 30 comic books weigh:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Now, we need to find out how much weight is left in the bag after taking out 30 comic books. Uriah's bag originally weighed 15 pounds, so after removing 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

3. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, to find out how many toys Uriah needs to take out, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to take out 15 more toys to bring the total weight to 15 pounds.

A wooden bridge can only carry up to 5000 pounds. A truck loaded with identical crates, each weighing 15 pounds, will drive over the bridge. The total weight of the driver and empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of crates the truck can load without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To solve this, we need to determine the maximum weight the truck can carry and then calculate how many crates can fit within that limit.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the driver and empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Subtract the weight of the empty truck to find the weight of the driver:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the driver} = 3755 \text{ pounds} - \text{Weight of the empty truck}
   \]

3. **Determine the maximum weight the truck can carry:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum weight the truck can carry} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - \text{Weight of the driver}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weight of one crate:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of one crate} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the maximum number of crates the truck can carry:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of crates} = \frac{\text{Maximum weight the truck can carry}}{\text{Weight of one crate}}
   \]

Let's perform the calculations step-by-step:

1. **Total weight of the driver and empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the driver:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the driver} = 3755 \text{ pounds} - \text{Weight of the empty truck}
   \]

3. **Maximum weight the truck can carry:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum weight the truck can carry} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - \text{Weight of the driver}
   \]

4. **Weight of one crate:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of one crate} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Maximum number of crates:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of crates} = \frac{\text{Maximum weight the truck can carry}}{\text{Weight of one crate}}
   \]

Now, let's assume the weight of the empty truck is \( W_{\text{empty}} \). We can calculate the weight of the driver as:
\[
\text{Weight of the driver} = 3755 \text{ pounds} - W_{\text{empty}}
\]

Substitute this into the maximum weight equation:
\[
\text{Maximum weight the truck can carry} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - (3755 \text{ pounds} - W_{\text{empty}})
\]
\[
\text{Maximum weight the truck can carry} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} + W_{\text{empty}}
\]
\[
\text{Maximum weight the truck can carry} = 1245 \text{ pounds} + W_{\text{empty}}
\]

Now, we can calculate the maximum number of crates:
\[
\text{Maximum number of crates} = \frac{1245 \text{ pounds} + W_{\text{empty}}}{15 \text{ pounds per crate}}
\]

Since \( W_{\text{empty}} \) is the weight of the empty truck, we need to find the maximum number of crates that can be loaded without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

Let's assume the weight of the empty truck is 2000 pounds (a typical value for an empty truck):
\[
\text{Weight of the driver} = 3755 \text{ pounds} - 2000 \text{ pounds} = 1755 \text{ pounds}
\]

Substitute this into the maximum weight equation:
\[
\text{Maximum weight the truck can carry} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 1755 \text{ pounds} = 3245 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we can calculate the maximum number of crates:
\[
\text{Maximum number of crates} = \frac{3245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds per crate}} = 216.33

Since the number of crates must be a whole number, the maximum number of crates the truck can load is:

Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each with a 3-month installment plan. A 2% interest rate is charged per phone. How much does Shiela pay each month for 3 months?

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Shiela bought 5 cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost is $150 * 5 = $750.
2. A 2% interest rate is charged per phone, so the total interest is $750 * 2% = $15.
3. The total amount Shiela has to pay is the sum of the cost and the interest, which is $750 + $15 = $765.
4. Since the payment is spread over 3 months, Shiela pays $765 / 3 = $255 each month.

If he builds a 4-story sandcastle with an upper level of 16 square meters, what is the average square meter count for each level?

To find the average square meter count for each level, we need to determine the total number of square meters in the sandcastle and then divide by the number of levels.

1. The upper level is 16 square meters.
2. Each subsequent level has half the square meters of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square meters for each level:

- Upper level: 16 square meters
- Second level: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square meters
- Third level: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square meters
- Fourth level: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square meters

Now, we sum the square meters of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square meter count per level, we divide the total square meters by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square meters per level} \]

Thus, the average square meter count for each level is $7.5$.",5,60

Cecilia needs to feed the puppy for 180 days in the first 180 days, and then for the remaining 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total number of days Cecilia needs to feed the puppy is 180 + 185 = 365 days.

Each day, she needs to feed the puppy 1 + 2 = 3 cups of dog food.

Therefore, the total number of cups of dog food Cecilia needs in the first year is 365 * 3 = 1095 cups.

Since each tute of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of tutes Cecilia needs is 1095 / 110 = 9.954545454545455.

\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age using the second relationship:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we can find Jackson's age using the first relationship:

John has a 10 hectare pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest within a year?

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare:
   \[
   \text{Total pineapples per hectare} = 100 \text{ pineapples/ha} \times 10 \text{ ha} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}

2. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year:
   \[
   \text{Number of harvests per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
   \[
   \text{Total pineapples per year} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/ha} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}

mgsm-de-174,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Billy prepares a potato salad for his barbecue party as a preparation for the big family gathering. It's a big event, so he needs to prepare 60 potatoes. The potatoes have roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. Billy takes about 1.5 minutes to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it small. How long will Billy take to finish the potato preparation?

Now, let's break down the time it takes to prepare each potato:

- Peeling one potato takes 1.5 minutes.
- Cutting one potato takes 5 seconds.

To find out how long it takes to prepare all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting them.

First, let's convert the peeling time to seconds:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for cutting 60 potatoes:
- 60 potatoes * 5 seconds per potato = 300 seconds.

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time:
- Total time = 90 seconds (peeling) + 300 seconds (cutting) = 390 seconds.

Finally, we convert the total time back to minutes:
- 390 seconds = 390 / 60 minutes = 6.5 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{6.5}$ minutes.",5,95

   - Cost of sugar per gallon: 2$
   - Total cost per gallon: 3$ + 2$ = 5$

2. **Revenue per gallon:**
   - Price per glass: 0.5$
   - Number of glasses per gallon: 20
   - Revenue per gallon: 0.5$ * 20 = 10$

3. **Profit per gallon:**
   - Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon: 10 - 5 = 5$

4. **Total profit:**
   - Total profit: 25$
   - Number of gallons: Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons: 25 / 5 = 5$

5. **Total cost of zitronen:**
   - Total cost of zitronen: Number of gallons * Cost of zitronen per gallon
   - Total cost of zitronen: 5 * 3 = 15$

mgsm-de-181,"English translation: Sandra, the flower shop across the street, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete delivery of the order. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white lilies. She also ordered 200 red jasmine flowers, which corresponded to five times the number of white lilies. Sandra threatened to switch flower suppliers if the missing red roses were not delivered by 5 PM. How many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 PM to keep Sandra's order?

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of red roses Sandra ordered.
- \( W \) as the number of white lilies Sandra ordered.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white lilies: \( R = 4W \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 red jasmine flowers, which corresponded to five times the number of white lilies: \( 200 = 5W \).

First, we solve for \( W \):
\[ 200 = 5W \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we substitute \( W = 40 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Two lightweight athletics teams are competing in a 4 x 400 meter race; a race where each team has four members who run either 400 meters or a standard distance. One of the two teams is very balanced and each of its members runs their 400 meter lap in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less balanced; its first runner takes 60 seconds for his 400 meter lap, and each subsequent runner takes 3 seconds less than the previous runner. Using these information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. The faster team has four members, each running their 400 meter lap in 55 seconds.
2. The slower team has four members, with the first runner taking 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner taking 3 seconds less than the previous runner.

Let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- First runner: 55 seconds
- Second runner: 55 - 3 = 52 seconds
- Third runner: 52 - 3 = 49 seconds
- Fourth runner: 49 - 3 = 46 seconds

Total time for the faster team = 55 + 52 + 49 + 46 = 202 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the slower team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

mgsm-de-184,"English translation: Jerry rolls a six-sided die. What is the probability (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers consecutively?

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes.
   - The total number of possible outcomes is 6.
   - Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers consecutively:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes for the first roll.
   - For the second roll, there are 2 favorable outcomes (since the number must be even).
   - Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes for two consecutive rolls is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - The total number of possible outcomes for two consecutive rolls is:
     \[
     6 \times 6 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     \frac{6}{36} = 0.1667 \text{ or } 16.67\%
     \]

3. **Compare the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers consecutively is approximately 16.67%.

4. **Determine the difference in percentages:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     50\% - 16.67\% = 33.33\%

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is $33.33\%$ more likely than rolling two even numbers consecutively.",33,25

Since there are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 5 straw pieces, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) straw pieces. The total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160. Since each rat gets 6 straw pieces, the number of rats is \( \frac{160}{6} = \frac{80}{3} \). Since the number of rats must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

To find out how much Mandy needs to give Benedict after 3 months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the interest rate per period.
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Plugging in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]

mgsm-de-96,"Harry slept last night for 9 hours. His friend James slept only 2/3 of the time Harry slept. How many more hours did Harry sleep than James?

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of the time Harry slept, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{James' sleep time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

After finding out how many hours James slept, we can subtract that from the number of hours Harry slept to find out how many more hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep time} - \text{James' sleep time} \]

Let's calculate this using Python.
```python
# Harry's sleep time
harry_sleep_time = 9

# James' sleep time
james_sleep_time = (2/3) * harry_sleep_time

# Difference in sleep time
difference = harry_sleep_time - james_sleep_time

mgsm-de-99,"Mary is a passionate gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new topiary plants from her favorite garden. She already has 2 topiary plants on each of the 40 windowsills of her large house. She is generous and decided to give 1 topiary plant from each window sill to her friends and family tomorrow. How many topiary plants does Mary have left?

To find out how many topiary plants Mary has left, we need to calculate the total number of topiary plants she has received and the number of plants she plans to give away, and then subtract the latter from the former.

1. Total number of topiary plants received: 18
2. Number of topiary plants on each window sill: 2
3. Number of window sills: 40
4. Number of topiary plants she plans to give away: 40 (one from each window sill)

Now, let's calculate the total number of topiary plants she has given away:

\[ \text{Total plants given away} = \text{Number of window sills} \times \text{Plants per window sill} = 40 \times 1 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of topiary plants she has left:

\[ \text{Plants left} = \text{Total plants received} - \text{Plants given away} = 18 - 40 = -22 \]

Jerome has 4 friends who visit him on a certain day. The first friend rings the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opens the door. The second friend rings the doorbell 1/4 as often as the first friend. The third friend rings the doorbell 10 times more often than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend rings the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring in total?

Now, let's answer the question in English:

Let's denote the number of times the fourth friend rings the doorbell as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 60 \).

The third friend rings the doorbell 10 times more often than the fourth friend, so the third friend rings the doorbell \( x + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

The second friend rings the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) as often as the first friend. Since the first friend rings the doorbell 20 times, the second friend rings the doorbell \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) times.

The first friend rings the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's sum up all the times the doorbell rang:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 5 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Jamal's camera can take 6 times as many photos as Brittany's camera.

If Jamal's camera can take 1800 photos, how many ducks are visible in Jamal's photo of the ducks at the zoo?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds on Jamal's photo of the ducks at the zoo. We know that Jamal's camera can take 1800 photos, and this is 6 times the number of photos that Brittany's camera can take. Therefore, Brittany's camera can take:

\[ \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \text{ photos} \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photos that Brittany's camera can take is 50 times the number of birds on Jamal's photo of the ducks at the zoo. Let \( x \) be the number of birds on Jamal's photo of the ducks at the zoo. Then:

\[ 300 = 50x \]

She has ten 2x4x10 large planks left, for which she paid $10 per piece. She also has five 4x4x10 planks, which she bought for $16 per piece. If she sells all of them, how much profit does she make?

To calculate the profit, we need to find the total cost of the wood and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- For the 2x4x10 planks: 10 planks * $10 per piece = $100
- For the 4x4x10 planks: 5 planks * $16 per piece = $80

Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, let's calculate the total revenue:
- For the 2x4x10 planks: 10 planks * $10 per piece = $100
- For the 4x4x10 planks: 5 planks * $16 per piece = $80

Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180

Let's denote the number of letters in the pile when Jenny started as \( x \).

According to the problem, Jenny stamps a third of the letters that need to be stamped. Since there are 60 letters in total, a third of these letters is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) letters.

After stamping 20 letters, there are 30 letters left in the pile that have already been stamped. This means that \( x - 20 = 30 \).

Solving for \( x \):

Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 chili peppers, and 10 oranges. How much money does he spend if each chili pepper costs $15?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of one watermelon:**
   - Let the cost of one chili pepper be \( C \).
   - According to the problem, \( C = 15 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of one watermelon:**
   - The cost of one watermelon is three times the cost of one chili pepper.
   - Therefore, the cost of one watermelon is \( 3 \times C = 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the items Dillon buys:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost for watermelons is \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.
   - Dillon buys 20 chili peppers, so the total cost for chili peppers is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.
   - Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount Dillon spends:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the costs of watermelons, chili peppers, and oranges.

polymath-low-de-33,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final answer is:

To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and divide it by the number of days he runs.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs on the first day:
\[ \text{Distance on the first day} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance he runs on the other two days:
\[ \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} \times 6 \text{ miles/hour} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add up the distances from all three days:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 18 \text{ miles} + 9 \text{ miles} + 9 \text{ miles} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we divide the total distance by the number of days he runs to find his average speed:

Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can only hop at half her running speed. If she can hop at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she cover within six hours if she spends a third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the speed Dana can run and hop:**
   - Dana can run at 4 times her walking speed.
   - Dana can hop at half her running speed.

2. **Calculate Dana's walking speed:**
   - Let \( v \) be Dana's walking speed in miles per hour.
   - Then, her running speed is \( 4v \).
   - Her hopping speed is \( \frac{4v}{2} = 2v \).

3. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends a third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking.
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance covered during running and walking:**
   - Distance covered while running: \( 4v \times 2 \) miles.
   - Distance covered while walking: \( v \times 4 \) miles.

If she held the gem in her hands, how far could Polly stand outside the dragon's fire range and still hit the dragon with the golden spear?

To answer this, we need to calculate the range of the golden spear with the sapphire gem in Polly's hands. The golden spear can be thrown 400 feet, and with the sapphire gem, it can be thrown three times as far. Therefore, the range with the gem is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

   - The red kimonos cost 50% more than the blue kimonos.
   - He spent $200 on blue kimonos, each costing $40.

2. **Calculate the total cost for blue kimonos:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for blue kimonos} = 200 \text{ US-Dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for red kimonos:**
   - Since the red kimonos cost 50% more than the blue kimonos, we need to find the cost of one red kimonos first.
   - The cost of one blue kimonos is $40.
   - Therefore, the cost of one red kimonos is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one red kimonos} = 40 \text{ US-Dollars} \times 1.5 = 60 \text{ US-Dollars}

To find the time for the return trip, we need to calculate the distance Tom traveled during the sailing period and then determine how long it takes to travel that distance at 6 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the distance Tom traveled during the sailing period:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

2. Calculate the time it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour:

polymath-low-de-52,"To solve this problem, let's first determine how much Uriah's Büchertasche weighs before he takes out the comic books and toys. We know that the total weight of the Büchertasche is 15 pounds. 

Uriah's comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he has 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Let's denote the number of toys he needs to take out as \( x \). Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the total weight of the toys is:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x \text{ pounds} \]

The weight of the Büchertasche after taking out the comic books and toys is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 - \frac{1}{2}x \]

Since the weight of the Büchertasche must be zero, we set up the equation:
\[ 15 - 7.5 - \frac{1}{2}x = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 15 - 7.5 = \frac{1}{2}x \]
\[ 7.5 = \frac{1}{2}x \]
\[ x = 7.5 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to take out 15 toys from his Büchertasche.

1. **Initial Rente**: Marcy receives a yearly rent of $50,000.
2. **Annual Increase**: After 20 years, she receives an additional 5% of the rent each year.
3. **Final Calculation**: We need to calculate her rent after 30 years.

Let's start with the initial rent:
- Initial rent = $50,000/year

After 20 years, the additional rent is:
- Additional rent after 20 years = 5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500/year

So, the rent after 20 years is:
- Rent after 20 years = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500/year

Now, we need to calculate the additional rent after the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30):
- Additional rent after 10 years = 5% of $52,500 = 0.05 * $52,500 = $2,625/year

So, the rent after 30 years is:
- Rent after 30 years = $52,500 + $2,625 = $55,125/year

- \( S \) as the amount of laundry Sarah washes in pounds.
- \( R \) as the amount of laundry Raymond washes in pounds.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

polymath-low-de-87,"English translation: A company pays each of its employees $600 per month. The company has a corporate policy where the salary of all employees is increased by 10% of their original salary for those who have been in the company for five years or more. If Sylvie was in the company exactly 5 years ago, what will her salary be after another three years?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the salary increase for Sylvie based on the given conditions and then determine her salary after three more years.

1. **Original Salary**: Let's denote the original monthly salary of Sylvie as \( S \).

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% for those who have been in the company for five years or more. Since Sylvie was in the company exactly 5 years ago, she qualifies for the increase.

3. **Salary Increase Calculation**: The increase in salary is \( 0.10 \times S \).

4. **New Salary**: The new salary after the increase is:
   \[
   S + 0.10S = 1.10S
   \]

5. **Salary After Three Years**: After another three years, the salary will increase by another 10% of the new salary. The increase in salary after three more years is:
   \[
   0.10 \times 1.10S = 0.11S
   \]

6. **Final Salary**: The final salary after the second increase is:
   \[
   1.10S + 0.11S = 1.21S
   \]

7. **Final Calculation**: To find the final salary, we need to know the original salary \( S \). However, since the problem does not provide the original salary, we can express the final salary in terms of \( S \).

Thus, the final salary after another three years will be \( 1.21S \).

To solve this, we first calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and then for the juveniles.

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults:
   - Each adult eats 10 pounds.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults = 10 pounds/adult * 20 adults = 200 pounds.

2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the juveniles:
   - Each juvenile eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.
   - There are 5 juveniles.
   - Total for juveniles = 5 pounds/juvenile * 5 juveniles = 25 pounds.

3. Add the total amounts for adults and juveniles to find the total amount of potato salad needed:

2. **Set up equations based on the relationships:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
   - Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
   - Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
   - Let \( I \) be James's age.

   From the problem, we have:

4. **Substitute Corey's age into the equations:**
   - Since \( C = 11 \), we can substitute \( C \) into the equations for Amy and Jackson:
   \[
   A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]
   \[
   J = A - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4

polymath-low-de-93,"English translation: Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. However, Gerald has changed his diet, which has improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how many seconds can Gerald run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet? 

To solve this, we need to calculate Gerald's new speed after the improvement and then find out how long it takes him to run the 400-meter hurdles.

1. First, we need to find Gerald's original speed. Since Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can express this as:
\[ \text{Lee's time} = \text{Gerald's time} - 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ 38 \text{ seconds} = \text{Gerald's time} - 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

2. Now, we need to calculate Gerald's improved speed. Since his speed has been improved by 10%, we can express this as:
\[ \text{Improved speed} = \text{Original speed} \times 1.10 \]

3. To find the original speed, we can use the fact that Lee's speed is the same as Gerald's original speed minus 2 seconds. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as \( v \). Then:
\[ v - 2 = 38 \]
\[ v = 38 + 2 \]
\[ v = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

4. Now, we can calculate Gerald's improved speed:
\[ \text{Improved speed} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Improved speed} = 44 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \( \boxed{44} \) seconds with his improved diet.",44,36

English translation:
On the highway, cars line up next to each other. Some of the cars drive through the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, followed by another 20 cars in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. 5 cars leave the line, so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam. If there were originally 30 cars on the highway, how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

Answer:
Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there were 30 cars on the highway. After 15 minutes, 20 more cars join the traffic jam, making the total number of cars \( x + 20 \). Then, 5 cars leave the line, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 - 5 = x + 15 \).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the number of cars that joined the traffic jam minus the number of cars that left, we have:
\[ x + 15 = x + 20 - 5 \]
\[ x + 15 = x + 15 \]

This equation is always true, which means our setup is correct. However, we need to find the specific value of \( x \). Since the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is the same as the number of cars that joined the traffic jam minus the number of cars that left, we can conclude that:
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{15} \).",15,5

Julia's Boot had a leak when it was on the lake outside. The boat had to drink two liters of water for every ten feet it rowed back to the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The beach was 64 seconds away. How much water did the boat drink when Julia reached the beach?

Now, let's calculate the answer:

1. Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds.
2. The boat had to drink 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
3. We need to find out how much water the boat drank when Julia reached the beach.

First, let's find out how many 10-foot segments are in 20 feet:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 2 \text{ segments} \]

Since the boat drinks 2 liters of water per segment, we can calculate the total amount of water it drank:
\[ 2 \text{ segments} \times 2 \text{ liters/segment} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat drank 4 liters of water when Julia reached the beach.

2. **Determine the number of teaching hours per day when the tafel is used:**
   Each teacher uses the tafel in every teaching hour, so the tafel is used for 8 hours per day.

3. **Determine the number of times the tafel is used per day:**
   Since the tafel is used for 8 hours per day and each hour is used by one teacher, the tafel is used by 8 teachers per day.

Let's denote the number of coffee spoons of sugar as \( x \) and the number of cups of water as \( y \). According to the problem, the ratio of coffee spoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This gives us the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{y} = \frac{7}{13} \]

We also know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ x + y = 120 \]

From the ratio equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = \frac{13}{7} x \]

Now substitute \( y \) in the total amount equation:

\[ x + \frac{13}{7} x = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{7x + 13x}{7} = 120 \]

\[ \frac{20x}{7} = 120 \]

Multiply both sides by 7 to clear the fraction:

\[ 20x = 840 \]

Divide both sides by 20:

\[ x = 42 \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Mark works 1000 sentences per week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark earn in a week in cents?

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark works on per week as \( S \), the rate per sentence for Publisher A as \( R_A \), and the rate per sentence for Publisher B as \( R_B \). We know that \( S = 1000 \), \( R_A = 0.05 \) cents per sentence, and \( R_B = 2 \times R_A = 2 \times 0.05 = 0.10 \) cents per sentence. Since Mark works on the same number of sentences for both publishers, the total earnings for each publisher can be calculated as follows:

- For Publisher A: \( \text{Total Earnings}_A = S \times R_A = 1000 \times 0.05 = 50 \) cents
- For Publisher B: \( \text{Total Earnings}_B = S \times R_B = 1000 \times 0.10 = 100 \) cents

Since Mark works on the same number of sentences for both publishers, the total earnings for Mark in a week is the sum of the earnings from both publishers:

\[ \text{Total Earnings}_M = \text{Total Earnings}_A + \text{Total Earnings}_B = 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ cents} \]

Carls Lieblingsessen is Cheese. He had a sandwich for lunch every day this week and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. 3 days a week he had Eier-Käse-Omeletts for breakfast and used 1 more slice of cheese per omelette than he used per sandwich. He made a big portion of Macaroni and Cheese for several dinners in the week and used 8 slices of cheese. How many slices of cheese did he use?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total amount of cheese Carls used. Let's break it down:

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - He had 7 days of sandwiches (7 days in a week).
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Eier-Käse-Omeletts:**
   - He had 3 days of omeletts.
   - Each omelette used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich.
   - Each omelette used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omeletts: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - He made 10 slices of cheese for Macaroni and Cheese (10 days in a week).

Now, we sum up all the cheese used:

- Sandwiches: 14 slices
- Omeletts: 9 slices

First, let's calculate the weight of each kandierte Apfel. Since each Schokoladenriegel weighs twice as much as each kandierte Apfel and each Schokoladenriegel weighs 40 g, each kandierte Apfel weighs 40 g / 2 = 20 g.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the Schokoladenriegel. Since there are 25 Schokoladenriegel and each weighs 40 g, the total weight of the Schokoladenriegel is 25 * 40 g = 1000 g.

Then, we calculate the total weight of the kandierte Äpfel. Since there are 80 kandierte Äpfel and each weighs 20 g, the total weight of the kandierte Äpfel is 80 * 20 g = 1600 g.

Finally, we add the total weight of the Schokoladenriegel and the kandierte Äpfel to get the total weight of the Süßigkeitentüte. The total weight is 1000 g + 1600 g = 2600 g.

""How many dollars is the cost of 20 bottles of soda less than the total cost of 50 plates, each costing $6000?""

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the cost of one bottle of soda as \( x \).
2. The total cost for 20 bottles of soda is \( 20x \).
3. The total cost for 50 plates, each costing $6000, is \( 50 \times 6000 = 300000 \) dollars.
4. According to the problem, the cost of 20 bottles of soda is $1200 less than the total cost of 50 plates. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   20x = 300000 - 1200

Sara wants to buy a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysits the neighbors 4 times a week and earns $5 for each babysitting session. Her parents pay her $4 for each lawn mowing session. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes?

To solve this, let's first calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
- Jacket: $30
- Two pairs of shoes: $20 * 2 = $40
- Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Next, let's calculate Sara's weekly earnings from babysitting and lawn mowing:
- Earnings from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20
- Earnings from lawn mowing: $4 * 1 = $4 (since she only mows the lawn once a week)
- Total weekly earnings: $20 + $4 = $24

Now, let's calculate how many weeks it will take for Sara to save $70:
- Number of weeks: $70 / $24 = 2.9167 weeks

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles

Since the large swimming pool had twice as much water as the small swimming pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the large swimming pool 4 minutes ago was \( 2x \) gallons. The large swimming pool is losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so the amount of water in the large swimming pool now is \( 2x - 4 \times 4 = 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the large swimming pool now has four times as much water as the small swimming pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4x \]
\[ -16 = 4x - 2x \]
\[ -16 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{-16}{2} \]
\[ x = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the large swimming pool now has four times as much water as the small swimming pool, but the amount of water in the large swimming pool is actually \( 2x - 16 \). So, we should have:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4x \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original value of the house before the repairs were added. Let's denote the original value of the house as \( V \).

The house is sold for $80,000 after adding $50,000 in repairs, resulting in a 150% increase in value. This means the selling price is 250% of the original value (100% + 150% = 250%).

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 80,000 = V \times 2.5 \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2.5:
\[ V = \frac{80,000}{2.5} = 32,000 \]

So, the original value of the house was $32,000. The profit is the selling price minus the original value:

   Wendi needs to feed 20 hens with the last meal. Each hen needs 15 + 25 = 40 servings of food.

2. **Calculate the total number of servings for all hens:**
   Total servings for all hens = 20 hens * 40 servings per hen = 800 servings.

3. **Determine the number of servings per meal:**
   Wendi gives 15 servings in the morning and 25 servings in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of servings per meal is:
   15 servings + 25 servings = 40 servings per meal.

4. **Calculate the number of meals needed:**

1. **Identify the cost of the first glass**: The first glass costs $5.
2. **Calculate the cost of the second glass**: The second glass costs 60% of $5. So, we calculate 60% of $5.
   \[
   0.60 \times 5 = 3
   \]
   Therefore, the second glass costs $3.
3. **Calculate the cost of the third glass**: The third glass costs 60% of $3. So, we calculate 60% of $3.
   \[
   0.60 \times 3 = 1.80
   \]
   Therefore, the third glass costs $1.80.
4. **Calculate the cost of the fourth glass**: The fourth glass costs 60% of $1.80. So, we calculate 60% of $1.80.
   \[
   0.60 \times 1.80 = 1.08
   \]
   Therefore, the fourth glass costs $1.08.
5. **Generalize the pattern**: We can see that each subsequent glass costs 60% of the previous glass's price. This forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.60\).

6. **Sum the series**: The total cost is the sum of the first 16 terms of this geometric series. The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
   \]
   Here, \(n = 16\), \(a = 5\), and \(r = 0.60\). Plugging in these values, we get:
   \[
   S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{1 - 0.60}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   1 - 0.60 = 0.40
   \]
   So,
   \[
   S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{0.40}
   \]
   Now, calculate \((0.60)^{16}\):
   \[
   (0.60)^{16} \approx 0.0348

   Therefore,
   \[
   S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - 0.0348}{0.40} = 5 \frac{0.9652}{0.40} = 5 \times 2.413 = 12.065

Two trains depart from San Rafael at the same time. They start heading west and both cover a distance of 80 miles. The next day, they head north and cover 150 miles. How far does each train travel in the two days?

To solve this, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in the two days.

1. For the first day:
   - The trains start at the same point and travel west for 80 miles.
   - They then travel north for 150 miles.
   - The total distance for the first day is \(80 + 150 = 230\) miles.

2. For the second day:
   - The trains travel west for 80 miles.
   - They then travel north for 150 miles.

mgsm-de-17,"To determine Jill's yearly salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both her teaching and coaching positions separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher.
- She works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.

\[
\text{Earnings from teaching} = 20 \, \text{USD/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{USD/year}

I have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-fifths water during the pouring process. However, I accidentally spill one liter of the orange juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of water in the initial orange juice:**
   - The initial orange juice is 10 liters with two-thirds water.
   - Calculate the amount of water in the initial orange juice:
     \[
     \text{Water in orange juice} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water in the initial pineapple juice:**
   - The initial pineapple juice is 15 liters with three-fifths water.
   - Calculate the amount of water in the initial pineapple juice:
     \[
     \text{Water in pineapple juice} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before spilling:**
   - Add the water from both juices:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Determine the amount of water left after spilling one liter:**
   - Subtract the spilled liter from the total water:
     \[
     \text{Water left} = \frac{47}{3} - 1 = \frac{47}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67 \text{ liters}

Let's denote the initial length of the candle as \( L \) centimeters.

From 13:00 to 14:00, the candle burns for 1 hour, so it melts by \( 2 \) centimeters. Therefore, the length of the candle at 14:00 is:
\[ L - 2 \]

From 14:00 to 15:00, the candle burns for another hour, so it melts by another \( 2 \) centimeters. Therefore, the length of the candle at 15:00 is:

Gloria is shopping for shoes when she finds a pair of boots that fit her budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels, which together cost $5 less than the boots. If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how much do the boots cost?

Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice that amount, which is $66. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99. The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots, so we can write the equation:

Let's denote:
- Darrell's age as \( D \)
- Allen's age as \( A \)

Given the ratio:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

We also know their current total age:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

First, express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ D = \frac{7}{11} A \]

Substitute \( D \) into the total age equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11} A + A = 162 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{7A}{11} + \frac{11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Solve for \( A \):

\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]

Terry buys 2 Joghurts per Tag. Assuming there are 30 days in the period, the total number of Joghurts sold is:
\[
\text{Total Joghurts sold} = 2 \text{ Joghurts per Tag} \times 30 \text{ Tags} = 60 \text{ Joghurts}
\]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the Joghurts.
The total revenue is the price per Joghurt multiplied by the total number of Joghurts sold:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 1,25 \text{ US-Dollar per Joghurt} \times 60 \text{ Joghurts} = 750 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Therefore, the answer is $750$.",750,75
mgsm-de-37,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:**
   - John has 13 Lego sets.
   - He sells each set for $15.
   - Total money from selling Lego sets: \( 13 \times 15 = 195 \) US dollars.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money John spent on buying the video games:**
   - John bought 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Total money spent on video games: \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \) US dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money John had initially:**
   - John had $195 from selling Lego sets.
   - He spent $160 on video games.
   - Total money initially: \( 195 + 160 = 355 \) US dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money John has left:**
   - John has $160 left after buying the video games.
   - He has $5 left after selling the Lego sets.
   - Total money left: \( 160 + 5 = 165 \) US dollars.

5. **Calculate the number of Lego sets John has left:**
   - John initially had 13 Lego sets.
   - He spent 160 US dollars on video games.
   - Total Lego sets left: \( 13 - 160 = -147 \).

Since the number of Lego sets cannot be negative, it means John does not have enough money left to buy any more Lego sets. Therefore, the number of Lego sets John has left is 0.

The final answer is: $0$.",0,2
mgsm-de-38,"English translation: John runs 60 miles per week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half that time on the other two days. How fast does he run?

To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and divide it by the total number of days he runs.

First, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week:
- On the first day, he runs 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs half of 3 hours, which is 1.5 hours.
- On the third day, he runs half of 3 hours, which is also 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add these times together to get the total time he runs in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time from hours to miles. We know that 1 mile is approximately 1.60934 kilometers, but for this calculation, we can use the fact that 1 mile is about 1.5 miles.

So, the total distance John runs in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we divide the total distance by the total number of days he runs to find his average speed:
\[ \frac{9 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 3 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$ miles per day.",3,10
mgsm-de-39,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk, but she can only hop at half her running speed. If she can hop at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she cover in six hours if she spends a third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?

Now, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can hop at 3 miles per hour.
   - She can only hop at half her running speed, so her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends a third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance covered during running:**
   - Running speed: 6 miles per hour.
   - Time running: 2 hours.
   - Distance running: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

4. **Calculate the distance covered during walking:**
   - Walking speed: 3 miles per hour.
   - Time walking: 4 hours.
   - Distance walking: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance covered:**
   - Total distance: \(12 + 12 = 24\) miles.

Let's denote the ages of the iPhones as follows:

- Bens iPhone: \( B \)
- Brandons iPhone: \( R \)

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

2. Bens iPhone is twice as old as Suzys iPhone: \( B = 2S \)
3. Suzys iPhone is 1 year old: \( S = 1 \)

First, we substitute \( S = 1 \) into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = 2S = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( B = 2 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

After the guests had eaten and the pies were gone, there were still 14 pieces of pie left. How many pieces did the guests take?

Now, let's answer it in English:

Let's denote the number of pieces the guests took as \( x \).

Initially, there were \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) pieces of pie.

After the guests took \( x \) pieces, there were 14 pieces left. So, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ 40 - 14 = x \]
\[ x = 26 \]

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.",26,26

1. **Determine the cost of materials and dochte for one kegelkerze:**
   - The cost of materials and dochte for one kegelkerze is $10.00.

2. **Determine the selling price of one kegelkerze:**
   - The selling price of one kegelkerze is $2.00.

3. **Calculate the profit per kegelkerze:**
   - Profit per kegelkerze = Selling price - Cost price
   - Profit per kegelkerze = $2.00 - $10.00 = -$8.00

4. **Calculate the total cost for 20 kegelkerzen:**
   - Total cost for 20 kegelkerzen = Profit per kegelkerze * Number of kegelkerzen
   - Total cost for 20 kegelkerzen = -$8.00 * 20 = -$160.00

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 kegelkerzen:**
   - Total revenue from selling 20 kegelkerzen = Selling price per kegelkerze * Number of kegelkerzen
   - Total revenue from selling 20 kegelkerzen = $2.00 * 20 = $40.00

6. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $160.00 = -$120.00

Therefore, the net profit when Charlie sells 20 kegelkerzen is $-120.00.",0,20

- Tuesday: 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours

If she had 23 post-it notes left, how many post-it notes were in the pack she bought?

Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the pack she bought as \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of post-it notes she had initially was 80, plus the number of post-it notes she bought, plus the number of post-it notes she stuck on the coffee cups. This can be expressed as:

\[ 80 + x + 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 300 + x = 23 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 300 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 23 - 300 \]
\[ x = -277 \]

Since the number of post-it notes cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the total number of post-it notes she had initially was 80, plus the number of post-it notes she bought, minus the number of post-it notes she stuck on the coffee cups. This can be expressed as:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ -140 + x = 23 \]

To find \( x \), we add 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the pack she bought is \( \boxed{163} \).",163,163

mgsm-de-246,"The question is in German, and it asks about the earnings of a maskerender (maskerender is a German term for a maskerender, which is a person who makes masks). The maskerender earns $250 per hour, and it takes 6 hours a day to make the mask, 4 times a week, and it takes 5 weeks to complete the film. After completing the film, the maskerender gets a 10% discount for the amount of work done. The question asks for the total amount Jean paid.

To calculate this, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked in 5 weeks.
2. Calculate the total earnings before the discount.
3. Calculate the total earnings after the discount.

Let's start with step 1:

- Hours per day: 6
- Days per week: 7
- Weeks: 5
- Total hours: 6 * 7 * 5 = 210 hours

Now, step 2:

- Hourly rate: $250
- Total earnings before discount: 210 * $250 = $52,500

Finally, step 3:

- Discount: 10%
- Discount amount: $52,500 * 10% = $5,250
- Total earnings after discount: $52,500 - $5,250 = $47,250

Therefore, the answer is $47,250.",250,27000

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Determine how many cookies Sue ate on Monday:
   - Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday.
   - Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
   - Therefore, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.

2. Determine how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday:
   - Sue ate double the amount of cookies her sister ate on Tuesday.
   - Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

3. Calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate:
   - Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

4. Calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate:
   - Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

5. Determine how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister:
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.
   - Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

polymath-low-de-2,"English translation: Josh decides to sell a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and adds $50,000 worth of repairs. As a result, the value of the house increases by 150%. How much profit does he make?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original value of the house before the repairs were added, and then calculate the profit.

1. Let's denote the original value of the house as \( V \).
2. After adding the $50,000 in repairs, the new value of the house is \( V + 50,000 \).
3. According to the problem, this new value is 150% of the original value, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   V + 50,000 = 1.5V
   \]
4. To find \( V \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   V + 50,000 = 1.5V \implies 50,000 = 0.5V \implies V = \frac{50,000}{0.5} = 100,000
   \]
   So, the original value of the house was $100,000.
5. The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the original value:
   \[

To solve this, let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. In the green house, she has \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
2. In the red house, she has 2 more vacuum cleaners, so she has \( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \) vacuum cleaners in the green house.
3. In the orange house, she has half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners in the orange house.

The total number of vacuum cleaners she has left is the sum of the vacuum cleaners in the green and orange houses, which is 5. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation for \( x \):

\[ \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \frac{x}{6} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{6} + 3 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x + x}{6} + 3 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{3x}{6} + 3 = 5 \]

polymath-low-de-20,"In English, the question is:
I have 10 liters of orange juice with two-thirds water and want to add 15 liters of pineapple juice with three-fifths water during the pouring. However, I accidentally spill one liter of the orange juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the orange juice and pineapple juice before and after the spill.

1. **Calculate the initial amount of water in the orange juice:**
   - The orange juice has two-thirds water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in the orange juice is:
     \[
     \text{Water in orange juice} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the initial amount of water in the pineapple juice:**
   - The pineapple juice has three-fifths water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple juice is:
     \[
     \text{Water in pineapple juice} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill:**
   - The total amount of water is the sum of the water in the orange juice and the pineapple juice:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water after the spill:**
   - One liter of the orange juice is spilled, so the amount of water in the orange juice decreases by one liter:
     \[
     \text{Water in orange juice after spill} = \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \approx 5.67 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - The amount of water in the pineapple juice remains the same:
     \[
     \text{Water in pineapple juice after spill} = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the orange juice after the spill and the pineapple juice:
     \[
     \text{Total water in remaining 24 liters} = \frac{17}{3} + 9 = \frac{17}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67 \text{ liters}

Let's denote the length of the candle at 10:00 as \( L \) centimeters. The candle burns from 10:00 to 14:00, which is 4 hours. In 4 hours, the candle will have melted \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) centimeters. Therefore, the length of the candle at 14:00 is \( L - 8 \) centimeters.

The candle burns from 13:00 to 17:00, which is 4 hours as well. In 4 hours, the candle will have melted \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) centimeters. Therefore, the length of the candle at 17:00 is \( L - 8 \) centimeters.

Since the candle burns for the same amount of time in both cases, the length of the candle at 17:00 is the same as the length of the candle at 14:00. This means that the candle is $8 - 8 = 0$ centimeters shorter at 17:00 compared to 14:00.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that the book was sold at a 25% discount, the price Kyle paid is 75% of the original price. This can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken dish:
   $12

2. Calculate the total cost of the milk:
   5 packs * $3/pack = $15

3. Calculate the total cost of the apples:
   4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6

4. Let's denote the number of packets of pizza as \( x \). The total cost of the pizza is \( 8.50x \).

5. The total amount spent is the sum of the costs of the chicken dish, milk, apples, and pizza:
   $12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50x = $50

6. Simplify the equation:
   $33 + $8.50x = $50

7. Subtract $33 from both sides:
   $8.50x = $17

1. Let the cost of the first pair of high heels be \( x \) dollars.
2. According to the problem, the second pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so the cost of the second pair is \( 2x \) dollars.
3. The combined cost of the two high heels is \( x + 2x = 3x \) dollars.
4. The problem states that the combined cost of the two high heels is $5 less than the cost of the pair of stilettos, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   3x = 33 - 5

polymath-low-de-30,"English translation: The age ratio of Darrell and Allen is 7:11. If they are now 162 years old, calculate how old Allen will be in 10 years.

Let's denote the current age of Darrell as \( D \) and the current age of Allen as \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write:

\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:

\[ D = \frac{7}{11} A \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 162 years:

\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11} A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):

\[ \frac{7}{11} A + A = 162 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]

\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Multiplying both sides by 11 to clear the fraction:

\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]

\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Dividing both sides by 18:

\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]

\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen is currently 99 years old. To find out how old Allen will be in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:
