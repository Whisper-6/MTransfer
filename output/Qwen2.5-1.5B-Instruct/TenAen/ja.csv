mgsm-ja-47,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost of the blue tie.
   - Let \( R \) be the cost of the red tie.

2. **Given information:**
   - The red tie costs twice as much as the blue tie: \( R = 2C \).
   - The red tie is 50% more expensive than the blue tie: \( R = C + 0.5C = 1.5C \).
   - The blue tie costs $40: \( C = 40 \).
   - The red tie costs $200: \( R = 200 \).

3. **Verify the consistency of the given information:**
   - From \( R = 2C \), substituting \( C = 40 \) gives \( R = 2 \times 40 = 80 \).
   - From \( R = 1.5C \), substituting \( C = 40 \) gives \( R = 1.5 \times 40 = 60 \).

There seems to be a discrepancy here because the given information states \( R = 200 \) and \( R = 80 \). However, we will proceed with the given \( R = 200 \) and \( C = 40 \) to find the total amount spent.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the blue tie and the red tie: \( \text{Total} = C + R = 40 + 200 = 240 \).

Therefore, the total amount John spent on the ties is $240.",240,800
mgsm-ja-48,"Question: Tracy was using a 4-foot long wire to support tomato seedlings in the garden. The wire is now cut to 6 inches. How many wires did she get?

Answer: Tracy used a wire that was 4 feet long and cut it to 6 inches. First, we need to convert the lengths to the same unit. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 48 inches. So, the wire was originally 48 inches long and was cut to 6 inches. The number of wires she got is calculated by dividing the original length by the new length:

$$
\text{Number of wires} = \frac{\text{Original length}}{\text{New length}} = \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches}} = 8
$$

So, Tracy got $8$ wires.",8,8

The question asks: ""Richard is living in a 15-story building. Each floor has 8 rooms, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. How many rooms are unoccupied in the building?""

To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we first need to determine the total number of rooms in the building and then subtract the number of occupied rooms.

1. Calculate the total number of rooms in the building:
   \[
   \text{Total rooms} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Rooms per floor} = 15 \times 8 = 120
   \]

2. Calculate the number of occupied rooms:
   \[
   \text{Occupied rooms} = \text{Total rooms} \times \frac{3}{4} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90
   \]

3. Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms:
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied rooms} = \text{Total rooms} - \text{Occupied rooms} = 120 - 90 = 30

So, the number of unoccupied rooms is $30$.",30,30
mgsm-ja-50,"Question: Does Robby have an egg farm? He lays 252 eggs per day, and sells them for $2 per doz. How many eggs can Robby produce in a week?

Answer: To find out how many eggs Robby can produce in a week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he lays in a week and then multiply that by the price per doz.

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Robby lays in a week:
\[ \text{Total eggs per week} = \text{Number of eggs per day} \times \text{Number of days in a week} \]
\[ \text{Total eggs per week} = 252 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Total eggs per week} = 1764 \]

2. Calculate the total revenue Robby makes from selling the eggs:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total eggs per week} \times \text{Price per doz} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 1764 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 3528 \]

mgsm-ja-53,"English Question: Mechanics charge different fees for repairing trucks and cars. For each tire repair on a truck, the mechanic charges $60, and for each tire repair on a car, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires on trucks and 4 tires on cars. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 tires in total, but none of them were on trucks. Which day did the mechanic earn more money?

To solve this, we need to calculate the earnings for each day and compare them.

1. **Thursday:**
   - Number of tires repaired on trucks: 6
   - Number of tires repaired on cars: 4
   - Earnings from truck tires: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars
   - Earnings from car tires: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars
   - Total earnings on Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars

2. **Friday:**
   - Total number of tires repaired: 12
   - Number of tires repaired on cars: 12
   - Earnings from car tires: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars
   - Since no truck tires were repaired, there are no earnings from truck tires.
   - Total earnings on Friday: \(480\) dollars

Now, we compare the earnings:
- Thursday's earnings: $520
- Friday's earnings: $480

The mechanic earned more money on Thursday.

mgsm-ja-54,"Question: The Doutfire sisters were driving to their home with seven kittens that were brought to them by the local shelter when their mother called them to tell them that two of their own cats had given birth to kittens. The first cat, Patch, gave birth to three times the number of kittens as the kittens they brought to the shelter, and the second cat, Trixie, gave birth to 12 kittens. How many kittens are in the Doutfire family now?

Answer: Let's denote the number of kittens the first cat, Patch, gave birth to as \( x \). According to the problem, Patch gave birth to three times the number of kittens as the kittens they brought to the shelter, which means the number of kittens Patch gave birth to is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \). So, \( x = 21 \).

Next, we know that Trixie gave birth to 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens in the Doutfire family is the sum of the kittens Patch and Trixie gave birth to, which is \( 21 + 12 = 33 \).

So, the number of kittens in the Doutfire family now is \( \boxed{33} \).",33,40

- For the $2.50 package: $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower
- For the $1 package: $1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

The cheaper option is the $1 package, so Vincent should buy 18 flowers for $18.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers at the cheaper price:

18 flowers * $0.50 per flower = $9

Vincent would save $9 if he buys 18 flowers at the cheaper price compared to buying them at the $2.50 package.",50,6
mgsm-ja-79,"Question: John becomes a dog foster parent. He takes the dog to a groomer for a $100 trim. The groomer offers a 30% discount for new customers. How much will the grooming cost?

Answer: To calculate the cost with the discount, we first need to find 30% of $100. This can be done by multiplying $100 by 0.30:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original price:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the grooming cost will be $70.

mgsm-ja-80,"The question in English is:

Two girls each drank 1/6 of 24 liters of water. After that, a boy drank 6 liters of water. How much water is left?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, calculate how much water the girls drank in total:
   \[
   24 \text{ liters} \times \frac{1}{6} = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. Then, calculate how much water the boy drank:

A soccer team played 22 games. They won more games than they lost by 8 games. How many games did they win?

To answer this, let's denote the number of games they won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the information given, we have two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \) (since they played 22 games in total)
2. \( W = L + 8 \) (they won 8 games more than they lost)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find out how many they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

There are 700 bees in the hive. The number of baby brood is 12 times the number of worker bees, and the number of queen bees is 2 times the number of baby bees. How many worker bees are there?

To find the number of worker bees, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees. Then, the number of baby bees is \( 12W \) and the number of queen bees is \( 2 \times 12W = 24W \).

The total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queen bees:

Combining like terms:

\[ 37W = 700 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = \frac{700}{37} \approx 18.92 \]

Each customer's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 package of cloth for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each package of cloth costs $5. These are the only expenses she has. She calculated that her total weekly income would be $92. The profit is the difference between her total income and total expenses. How much profit does Lucas make each week?

Answer: To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total expenses and then subtract it from the total income.

1. Calculate the total expenses:
   - Each customer needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 package of cloth.
   - Each bottle of bleach costs $2, and each package of cloth costs $5.
   - Total cost for bleach per customer = 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4.

Answer: To find the total length of all the baked goods laid out in a row, we need to calculate the total length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Length of rolls**: 
   \[
   \text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Length of croissants**: 
   \[
   \text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}

3. **Length of baguettes**: 
   \[
   \text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 2 \text{ feet/baguette} = 60 \text{ feet}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths:
\[
\text{Total length} = 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 60 \text{ feet}
\]

Convert the inches to feet for easier addition:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} = \frac{1200}{12} \text{ feet} = 100 \text{ feet}
\]
\[
720 \text{ inches} = \frac{720}{12} \text{ feet} = 60 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, add all the lengths together:
\[
\text{Total length} = 100 \text{ feet} + 60 \text{ feet} + 60 \text{ feet} = 220 \text{ feet}

mgsm-ja-157,"Question: The BREAK and KERRY are competing to see who can run the most distance in 15 minutes. They have decided to race on a football field that is 100 yards long. The BREAK runs 15 laps around the field. KERRY decides to run 1 lap around the field, then runs 40 yards to the end of the field, turns around, and runs back to the starting point. She does this 34 times. Who ran the most distance and by how much?

Answer: The BREAK ran 15 laps around the 100-yard field, which is 15 * 100 = 1500 yards. KERRY ran 1 lap around the 100-yard field, which is 100 yards, and then ran 40 yards to the end of the field, which is 40 yards. She then ran back to the starting point, which is another 40 yards. So, KERRY ran a total of 100 + 40 + 40 = 180 yards. The BREAK ran 1500 - 180 = 1320 yards more than KERRY. Therefore, the BREAK ran the most distance, and they ran 1320 yards more than KERRY.

The depth of the water tank on Monday was 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet of water added. On Tuesday, the water depth was 2/3 of the water depth on Monday. How deep was the water on Tuesday?

To answer this, we need to calculate the water depth on Tuesday based on the information given.

Let's denote the water depth on Monday as \( D_{\text{Monday}} \) and the water depth on Tuesday as \( D_{\text{Tuesday}} \).

We know:
1. \( D_{\text{Monday}} = 17 \) feet
2. \( D_{\text{Tuesday}} = D_{\text{Monday}} + 7 \) feet
3. \( D_{\text{Tuesday}} = \frac{2}{3} \times D_{\text{Monday}} \)

First, calculate \( D_{\text{Tuesday}} \) using the third piece of information:
\[ D_{\text{Tuesday}} = \frac{2}{3} \times 17 \]

Now, let's compute this:

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total value of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red cars**: There are 5 red cars, and each costs 4 dollars.
   \[
   5 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 20 \text{ dollars}

Let's denote Sese's current age as \( S \) and Brook's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Sese is 2 years older than Brook: \( S = B + 2 \)
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Next, substitute \( S = B + 2 \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ (B + 2) + B = 24 \]
\[ 2B + 2 = 24 \]
\[ 2B = 22 \]
\[ B = 11 \]

Now that we know Brook's current age is 11, we can find Sese's current age using \( S = B + 2 \):

To calculate the total time it will take for Billie to prepare the potatoes, we need to consider both the time spent peeling and cutting the potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time spent peeling all the potatoes:
- There are 60 potatoes.
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, the total time spent peeling is 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting all the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, the total time spent cutting is 60 potatoes * 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds.

Now, let's convert the time spent peeling from minutes to seconds:
- 90 minutes = 90 * 60 seconds = 5400 seconds.

Finally, let's add the time spent peeling and cutting to get the total time:
- Total time = Time spent peeling + Time spent cutting = 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds.

To convert the total time back to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling lemonade is:
     \[
     20 \text{ cups/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$10 \text{ per gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of ingredients per gallon:**
   - They use 3 gallons of lemon for 1 gallon of lemonade.
   - Each gallon of lemon costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of ingredients for 1 gallon of lemonade is:
     \[
     3 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$9 \text{ per gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - The profit per gallon is the total revenue minus the total cost:

240 = 80 + Number of Chinese

Number of Chinese = 240 - 80 = 160

Since the number of Chinese men is 60, the number of Chinese women would be:

Number of Chinese women = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese men
Number of Chinese women = 160 - 60 = 100

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{100}$",100,100

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   - Rent = 1/4 of his salary
   - Salary = 6000 dollars
   - Rent = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500 dollars

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   - Fuel = 1/3 of his salary
   - Fuel = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000 dollars

3. **Calculate the amount spent on charity:**
   - Charity = 1/2 of his salary
   - Charity = 6000 * 1/2 = 3000 dollars

4. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Rent + Fuel + Charity
   - Total expenses = 1500 + 2000 + 3000 = 6500 dollars

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after expenses and donations:**
   - Total expenses = 6500 dollars
   - Total donations = 200 (to his daughter) + 700 (to his wife) = 900 dollars
   - Total expenses and donations = 6500 + 900 = 7400 dollars

6. **Calculate the remaining amount after expenses and donations:**
   - Salary = 6000 dollars
   - Remaining amount = Salary - Total expenses and donations
   - Remaining amount = 6000 - 7400 = -1400 dollars

mgsm-ja-182,"Question: Jane is 2 years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jane's age. If Jane is 30 years old, how old is Mark?

Answer: Let's denote Jane's current age as \( J \) and Mark's current age as \( M \). According to the problem, Jane is 2 years older than Mark, so we have:

\[ J = M + 2 \]

Two years ago, Jane's age was \( J - 2 \) and Mark's age was \( M - 2 \). The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jane's age at that time, so we have:

\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2) + 5 \]

Now, we substitute \( J = M + 2 \) into the second equation:

\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}((M + 2) - 2) + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}M + 5 \]
\[ M - \frac{1}{2}M = 7 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}M = 7 \]
\[ M = 14 \]

So, Mark is 14 years old. Since Jane is 2 years older than Mark, Jane is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) years old. Therefore, the answer is:

mgsm-ja-184,"Question: Jerry is rolling a 6-sided die. The probability that he rolls a number greater than 3 is higher than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. By what percentage is this probability higher?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of the two events and compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a 6-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers:**
   - The even numbers on a 6-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{first even}) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
     \]
   - After rolling an even number, the probability of rolling another even number is:
     \[
     P(\text{second even} | \text{first even}) = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - Therefore, the combined probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is:
     \[
     P(\text{two consecutive even}) = 0.5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 0.2 \text{ or } 20\%
     \]

3. **Difference in probabilities:**
   - The difference between the two probabilities is:
     \[
     50\% - 20\% = 30\%

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is $30\%$ higher than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers.",30,25

mgsm-ja-187,"English translation: Mandi borrows $100 from Benedict at an interest rate of 2% per month. If Mandi repays the loan three months later, how much should she pay Benedict?

To find out how much Mandi should pay Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for three months and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the interest rate per period.
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the principal amount)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate per month)
- \( n = 3 \) (3 months)

Let's calculate the amount Mandi should pay Benedict:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Since we don't have the exact number of cats, we can't calculate the exact total. However, we can express the total in terms of $C$:

1. **Daily TV Viewing Schedule:**
   - Monday and Tuesday: Each watched 1 hour of their favorite show.
   - Wednesday: Watched 30 minutes of an episode.
   - Thursday: Watched 1 hour of an episode and 30 minutes of another episode.
   - Friday: Watched 2 hours of an episode.

2. **Total TV Viewing Time:**
   - Total time spent watching TV is 7 hours.

3. **Calculation:**
   - We need to find out how many 30-minute episodes were watched on Wednesday.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. **Calculate the total time spent on Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Each watched 1 hour of their favorite show.
   - Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

2. **Calculate the total time spent on Wednesday:**
   - Watched 30 minutes of an episode.
   - Total time = 30 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent on Thursday:**
   - Watched 1 hour of an episode and 30 minutes of another episode.
   - Total time = 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.

4. **Calculate the total time spent on Friday:**
   - Watched 2 hours of an episode.
   - Total time = 2 hours.

5. **Calculate the total time spent on all days:**
   - Total time = 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 30 minutes (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5 hours and 30 minutes.

6. **Convert the total time to hours:**
   - 5 hours and 30 minutes = 5.5 hours.

7. **Calculate the remaining time spent on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Total time spent on all days = 7 hours.
   - Remaining time = 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

8. **Convert the remaining time to minutes:**
   - 1.5 hours = 1.5 × 60 minutes = 90 minutes.

9. **Calculate the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday:**
   - Total time spent on Wednesday = 30 minutes.
   - Number of 30-minute episodes = 30 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 1 episode.

Unfortunately, someone made a mistake, and Bertrès' fruit roll was 2 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, while Marcel's fruit roll was 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long. If they eat all the rolls, how much did they eat on average?

Answer: To find the average, we need to calculate the total length of the fruit rolls each person ate and then divide by the number of rolls.

For Bertrès:
Total length = 2 rolls wide * 24 rolls long = 48 rolls

For Marcel:
Total length = 3 rolls wide * 14 rolls long = 42 rolls

Total length eaten = 48 rolls + 42 rolls = 90 rolls

Number of rolls eaten = 2 rolls + 3 rolls = 5 rolls

Average length eaten = Total length eaten / Number of rolls eaten = 90 rolls / 5 rolls = 18 rolls

1. First, we need to calculate how many times the boat passes the 10-foot mark before it reaches the shore.
2. The boat travels 10 feet each time it passes the 10-foot mark.
3. The distance to the shore is 64 seconds, and the boat travels 10 feet per 64 seconds.
4. To find out how many times the boat passes the 10-foot mark, we divide the total distance by the distance per mark:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 6.4 \text{ times}

5. Since the boat passes the 10-foot mark 6.4 times, it will have passed the 10-foot mark 6 times before reaching the shore.
6. Each time it passes the 10-foot mark, 2 liters of water are added to the boat.
7. Therefore, the total amount of water added to the boat is:

To answer this question, we need to find the number of chickens Jamar took at the zoo. Let's denote the number of chickens Jamar took as \( x \).

According to the information given:
1. Jamar's phone can save 6 times as many photos as Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can save 50 times the number of birds in the photo of the chickens Jamar took at the zoo.
3. Jamar's phone can save 1800 photos.

Let's denote the number of photos saved by Brittany's phone as \( y \).

From the information given in point 1, we can write:
\[ 1800 = 6y \]

From point 2, we can write:
\[ y = 50x \]

Now, we can substitute \( y \) from point 2 into the equation from point 1:
\[ 1800 = 6 \times 50x \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 1800 = 300x \]

Dividing both sides by 300:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Each board costs $10.
   - There are 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 boards.
   - Total cost for 80 boards = 80 * $10 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Each board costs $16.
   - There are 4 x 4 x 10 = 160 boards.
   - Total cost for 160 boards = 160 * $16 = $2560.

3. **Calculate the total cost for both types of boards:**

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the boards:**
   - Since the boards have increased in value by 50%, the selling price will be 1.5 times the original price.
   - Selling price for 80 boards = 80 * $10 * 1.5 = $1200.
   - Selling price for 160 boards = 160 * $16 * 1.5 = $3840.
   - Total revenue = $1200 + $3840 = $5040.

1. **Identify the given ratio and the total amount of ingredients:**
   - The ratio of coffee to sugar to water is 7:13.
   - The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 cups.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of coffee in cups.
   - According to the ratio, the amount of sugar is \( \frac{7}{13}x \) and the amount of water is \( \frac{13}{13}x = x \).
   - The total amount of sugar and water is given as 120 cups, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     \frac{7}{13}x + x = 120
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \[
     \frac{7}{13}x + \frac{13}{13}x = 120
     \]
     \[
     \frac{20}{13}x = 120
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 13 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     20x = 1560
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     x = 78

4. **Determine the amount of sugar used:**
   - The amount of sugar is \( \frac{7}{13}x \):

Let's denote:
- Aidrian's salary four years ago as \( A \)
- Rilia's salary four years ago as \( R \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Aidrian's salary four years ago is \( A \)

mgsm-ja-129,"English translation: A hospital sees 500 patients per day. Each patient is examined for an average of 24 minutes. The doctor charges $150 per hour for his services. The hospital charges $200 per hour for its services. How much revenue does the hospital generate from patient examinations?

Let's break down the problem:

1. The hospital sees 500 patients per day.
2. Each patient is examined for an average of 24 minutes.
3. The doctor charges $150 per hour for his services.
4. The hospital charges $200 per hour for its services.

First, we need to calculate the number of hours the hospital spends on patient examinations per day:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \frac{\text{Number of patients}}{\text{Average examination time}} = \frac{500}{24} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital from patient examinations:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total hours} \times (\text{Doctor's charge} + \text{Hospital's charge}) \]

Let's perform the calculations:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \frac{500}{24} \approx 20.83 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 20.83 \times (150 + 200) \]

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 20.83 \times 350 \]

polymath-low-ja-39,"Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

1. **Understanding the speeds:**
   - Let's denote the speed of walking as \( w \) miles per hour.
   - The speed of running is \( 4w \) miles per hour.
   - The speed of skipping is \( \frac{w}{2} \) miles per hour.

2. **Given information:**
   - The speed of skipping is \( \frac{w}{2} \) miles per hour.
   - The total time spent walking and skipping is 6 hours.

3. **Setting up the equation:**
   - Let \( t_1 \) be the time spent walking.
   - Let \( t_2 \) be the time spent skipping.
   - We know that \( t_1 + t_2 = 6 \) hours.

4. **Speeds and distances:**
   - The distance covered while walking is \( w \cdot t_1 \).
   - The distance covered while skipping is \( \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_2 \).

5. **Total distance covered:**
   - The total distance \( D \) is the sum of the distances covered while walking and skipping.
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_2 \).

6. **Substitute \( t_2 \) with \( 6 - t_1 \):**
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + \frac{w}{2} \cdot (6 - t_1) \).

7. **Simplify the equation:**
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + \frac{w}{2} \cdot 6 - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).

8. **Simplify further:**
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).

9. **Final distance calculation:**
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).
   - \( D = w \cdot t_1 + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot t_1 \).

10. **Given that \( t_1 = \frac{3}{4} \) hours:**
    - \( D = w \cdot \frac{3}{4} + 3w - \frac{w}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \).
    - \( D = \frac{3w}{4} + 3w - \frac{3w}{8} \).
    - \( D = \frac{3w}{4} + 3w - \frac{3w}{8} \).

11. **Combine the terms:**
    - \( D = \frac{3w}{4} + 3w - \frac{3w}{8} \).
    - \( D = \frac{3w}{4} + 3w - \frac{3w}{8} \).

12. **Simplify the final distance:**
    - \( D = \frac{3w}{4} + 3w - \frac{3w}{8} \).
    - \( D = \frac{3w}{4} + 3w - \frac{3w}{8} \).

13. **Final answer:**
    - \( D = \frac{3w}{4} + 3w - \frac{3w}{8} \).

polymath-low-ja-51,"The English translation of the question is:

Tom's ship can travel 10 miles per hour. He is sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM. After that, he sails back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. How long does it take for him to return?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the distance Tom travels during his sailing time and then determine the time it takes for him to return at the slower speed.

1. Calculate the distance Tom travels during his sailing time:
   - From 1 PM to 4 PM is 3 hours.
   - At 10 miles per hour, the distance is \( 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \).

2. Calculate the time it takes for Tom to return at 6 miles per hour:
   - The distance is 30 miles.
   - At 6 miles per hour, the time is \( \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to return.

""Yuura's backpack is too heavy for her. She needs to remove 15 pounds from it. Her comic books are each 1/4 pound and toys are each 1/2 pound. If she removes 30 comic books, how many toys does she need to remove?""

To answer this question, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books she is removing:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Now, we subtract this weight from the total weight she needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Since toys weigh 1/2 pound each, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound/toy = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys

So, she needs to remove 15 toys.",15,15

polymath-low-ja-54,"English translation: The Dout Fire sisters, after their mother called them saying that the two cats at their home had given birth to kittens, brought 7 kittens from the local shelter to their home. They said that the first cat, Patch, had given birth to 3 times the number of kittens as the kittens they brought, and the other cat, Trixie, had given birth to 12 kittens. How many kittens does the Dout Fire family have now?

Answer: Let's denote the number of kittens Patch gave birth to as \( x \). According to the problem, Trixie gave birth to 12 kittens. Patch gave birth to 3 times the number of kittens as the ones they brought, so we can write the equation:

\[ x = 3 \times 7 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 21 \]

So, Patch gave birth to 21 kittens. Trixie gave birth to 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens in the Dout Fire family is:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The bridge can withstand a maximum weight of 5000 pounds.
   - The truck is carrying 33 boxes, each weighing 15 pounds.
   - The total weight of the truck and its load is 3755 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight of boxes} = 33 \times 15 = 495 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining weight capacity of the truck:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 3755 - 495 = 3260 \text{ pounds}

4. **Calculate the maximum number of additional boxes that can be loaded:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of additional boxes} = \frac{3260}{15} \approx 217.33

   Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, we take the floor value:
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of additional boxes} = 217

polymath-low-ja-60,"Question: In a basket, there is 1 rotten orange, 20% are still green, 2 are sour, and the rest are good oranges. How many good oranges are there in the basket?

Answer: Let's denote the total number of oranges in the basket as \( x \).

According to the problem, we have:
- 1 rotten orange
- 20% of the oranges are still green, which means \( 0.2x \) oranges are green.
- 2 oranges are sour, so the number of good oranges is \( x - 1 - 0.2x - 2 \).

The problem states that the number of good oranges is 25. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - 1 - 0.2x - 2 = 25 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 0.8x - 3 = 25 \]
\[ 0.8x = 28 \]
\[ x = \frac{28}{0.8} \]
\[ x = 35 \]

So, the total number of oranges in the basket is 35. The number of good oranges is:
\[ 35 - 1 - 0.2 \times 35 - 2 \]

3. The number of emeralds \( E \) is twice the number of rubies, so \( E = 2R \).
4. The total number of gems is the sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, which is given as 175.

So, we have:
\[ D + R + E = 175 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( E \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ D + (D - 35) + 2(D - 35) = 175 \]

\[ 4D - 105 = 175 \]
\[ 4D = 280 \]
\[ D = 70 \]

So, the number of diamonds is 70.

How many teachers are there in Dr. Weitz's school if there are twice as many boys as girls, with 60 girls, and there are 5 students for each teacher?

To answer this question, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys in the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students.
3. Use the ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers.

Step 1: The number of boys is twice the number of girls. Since there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Step 2: The total number of students is the sum of the number of girls and boys:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 60 \text{ girls} + 120 \text{ boys} = 180 \text{ students} \]

Step 3: We know that there are 5 students for each teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Answer: Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as \( x \).

Bailey received $5 weekly allowance for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she received is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she had $100 in total, so the initial amount plus the total allowance equals $100:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find the initial amount \( x \), we subtract $40 from both sides of the equation:

A painter is selling flowers at the farmers' market. He has three types of flowers to sell: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. Marigolds are sold in 1-pint pots for $2.74, petunias are sold in 1-pint pots for $1.87, and begonias are sold in 1-pint pots for $2.12. The painter does not have change today, so he decides to set the prices of all flowers to the nearest dollar. If the painter sells 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias, how much will he make?

### 答案

首先，我们计算每种花的总价：

- **Marigolds**: 12 铅笔 × $2.74 = $32.88
- **Petunias**: 9 铅笔 × $1.87 = $16.83
- **Begonias**: 17 铅笔 × $2.12 = $36.04

接下来，我们计算总价：

$32.88 + $16.83 + $36.04 = $85.75

最后，将总价四舍五入到最近的美元：

$85.75 ≈ $86

所以，如果画家卖出 12 铅笔的 marigolds, 9 铅笔的 petunias, 和 17 铅笔的 begonias，他将赚得 $86。",86,88
polymath-low-ja-75,"Question: Luke is building a sand castle on the beach. He spends time building each layer of the castle. He realizes that each layer is half the width of the layer below it. If he builds a 4-layer sand castle and the top layer is 16 square feet, what is the average width of each layer?

Answer: Let's denote the width of the top layer as \( W \). Since each layer is half the width of the layer below it, the widths of the layers are \( W \), \( \frac{W}{2} \), \( \frac{W}{4} \), and \( \frac{W}{8} \).

The total area of the sand castle is the sum of the areas of all the layers:
\[ W + \frac{W}{2} + \frac{W}{4} + \frac{W}{8} = 16 \]

To find \( W \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 8:
\[ \frac{8W}{8} + \frac{4W}{8} + \frac{2W}{8} + \frac{W}{8} = 16 \]
\[ \frac{15W}{8} = 16 \]
\[ 15W = 128 \]
\[ W = \frac{128}{15} \]

The average width of each layer is the total width divided by the number of layers:
\[ \text{Average width} = \frac{W}{4} = \frac{\frac{128}{15}}{4} = \frac{128}{15 \times 4} = \frac{128}{60} = \frac{32}{15} \]

So, the average width of each layer is \( \boxed{\frac{32}{15}} \) square feet.",15,60

polymath-low-ja-77,"Question: How much difference in laundry is there between Raymond and David if Sara did the same amount of laundry as she did when she washed half of what Sally did, and Sara washed 400 pounds of laundry?

Answer: Let's denote the amount of laundry Sally washed as \( S \). According to the problem, when Sara washed half of what Sally did, she washed \( \frac{S}{2} \). Then, when Sara washed 400 pounds of laundry, we have:
\[ 400 = \frac{S}{2} \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ S = 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ pounds} \]
So, Sally washed 800 pounds of laundry. When Sara washed half of what Sally did, she washed:
\[ \frac{800}{2} = 400 \text{ pounds} \]
This means that when Sara washed 400 pounds of laundry, she did the same amount as Sally. Therefore, if Sara washed 400 pounds of laundry, both Sally and David washed 400 pounds of laundry. The difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David is:
\[ 400 - 400 = 0 \text{ pounds} \]
So, the difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]",0,100

Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much more will he save if he buys 18 flowers at the cheaper price?

To find the answer, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at each price and then find the difference.

1. Cost of 18 flowers at the $2.50 per 3-flower package:
   - 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
   - 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

2. Cost of 18 flowers at the $1 per 2-flower package:
   - 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
   - 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.00

3. Difference in cost:
   - $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Vincent will save $6.00 by buying the flowers at the cheaper price.",0,6

Two girls each drank 1/6 of 24 liters of water. After that, the boy drank 6 liters of water. How much water is left?

To solve this, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate how much water the girls drank in total:
   - Each girl drank 1/6 of 24 liters.
   - Total for both girls: \(24 \times \frac{1}{6} \times 2 = 8\) liters.

2. Calculate how much water the boy drank:
   - The boy drank 6 liters.

3. Calculate the total amount of water consumed:
   - Total consumed: \(8 + 6 = 14\) liters.

4. Calculate the remaining water:
   - Initial amount: 24 liters.
   - Remaining: \(24 - 14 = 10\) liters.

So, the answer is 10 liters.",10,10

3. **Stickers received as a gift:**
   - Charlie receives 23 stickers as a gift.

4. **Stickers given to the sister:**
   - Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister.

5. **Stickers used for greeting cards:**

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. Alex's weight is 2 pounds lighter than 4 times the weight of Grace. What is the total weight of Grace and Alex?

To solve this, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( G \) be Grace's weight and \( A \) be Alex's weight.

Given:
1. \( G = 125 \) pounds
2. \( A = 4G - 2 \) pounds

Now, we can find Alex's weight by substituting \( G \) into the equation:

\[ A = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Let's calculate \( A \):

\[ A = 500 - 2 \]
\[ A = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the total weight of Grace and Alex by adding their weights together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = G + A \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 125 + 498 \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

A soccer team played 22 games. They won more games than they lost by 8 games. How many games did they win?

Let's denote the number of games won by the team as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. They won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( W \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

   - The alarms are set to go off 1 time per day.

2. **First Alarm:**
   - The first alarm goes off at the start of the day.
   - It rings once.
   - Total ringing: 1

3. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm goes off 3 times longer than the first alarm.
   - The first alarm rings once, so the second alarm rings 3 times.
   - Total ringing: 3

4. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm goes off half as long as the second alarm.
   - The second alarm rings 3 times, so the third alarm rings 3 times divided by 2.
   - Total ringing: 3 / 2 = 1.5 (but since we can't have half an alarm ringing, we round down to 1)

5. **Total Ringing:**
   - First alarm: 1 ring

A company pays its employees $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing the annual salary of employees by 10% each year for the next 5 years. If Sylvie, who has just turned 5 years old, started working for the company last year, what will her annual salary be after working for an additional 3 years?

To solve this, we need to calculate the annual salary increase over the next 3 years, starting from her current annual salary of $600.

Let's denote her current annual salary as \( S \). Since she started working last year, her salary will increase by 10% each year for the next 3 years.

The formula to calculate her salary after 3 years is:

\[ S_{\text{after 3 years}} = S \times (1 + 0.10)^3 \]

Given \( S = 600 \):

\[ S_{\text{after 3 years}} = 600 \times (1.10)^3 \]

Now, let's calculate this value:

\[ S_{\text{after 3 years}} = 600 \times 1.331 \]

\[ S_{\text{after 3 years}} = 798.6 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after working for an additional 3 years will be $798.6.",6,9360

Answer: Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harold as \( H \). Then the number of copies sold by Marilyn is \( 10H \).

According to the problem, the total number of copies sold by both is 88,000. So we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

   - Number of guests who will attend = 16 * (6/10) = 9.6 ≈ 9 guests (since the number of guests must be a whole number, we round down).

2. Calculate the total number of gift bags needed:
   - Total gift bags needed = 9 guests * 75 bags/guest = 675 bags.

If Tyrannosaurus Ted wants to make sure that everyone has enough to eat, and there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of salad should Tyrannosaurus Ted bring to the picnic?

To find the answer, we need to calculate the total amount of salad needed for both adults and children:

1. **Initial Speed of Lee**: Lee was able to run 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds before he improved his diet.
2. **Speed Improvement**: His diet improved his speed by 10%. This means his new speed is 110% of his original speed.
3. **New Speed Calculation**: If Lee's initial speed was \( v \), then his new speed after improvement is \( 1.1v \).
4. **Time Calculation**: Since the distance is the same (400 meters), we can use the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \). The time Lee took before the improvement is 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   38 = \frac{400}{v}

   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{400}{38} \approx 10.53 \text{ seconds}

Given that each can of tomato paste contains 3 tomatoes and the final batch was 32 ounces, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes used as follows:

1. Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
2. The final batch was 32 ounces, which is equivalent to 32 cans.

3. The remaining 15 minutes, 20 cars were stuck in the traffic.

We need to find out how many cars were not stuck in the traffic during the first 15 minutes.

First, calculate the total number of cars stuck in the traffic:
\[ \text{Total cars stuck} = 5 + 20 = 25 \]

Then, subtract the number of cars stuck from the initial number of cars to find out how many were not stuck:
\[ \text{Cars not stuck} = 30 - 25 = 5 \]

polymath-low-ja-101,"Question: Solo must read 4 pages of the science textbook, 20 pages of the sociology textbook, 7 pages of the history textbook, and 8 pages of the geography textbook. If Solo has 4 days left to read, how many pages does he need to read on average each day to finish all his reading?

Answer: Let's denote the number of pages Solo needs to read each day as \( x \). Since he has 4 days left, the total number of pages he needs to read is \( 4x \).

The total number of pages he has to read is:
\[ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Since he has 4 days left, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 39 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{39}{4} = 9.75 \]

So, Solo needs to read $9.75$ pages on average each day to finish all his reading.

polymath-low-ja-102,"English translation: John likes to drink one cup of water every morning, noon, and dinner time. In the end, he drinks one cup before going to bed. John does this every day on weekdays but wants to relax on weekends, so he drinks soda instead of water at dinner time. How many times more water does he drink in a week?

Answer: Let's denote the number of cups of water John drinks in a day as \( x \). Since he drinks one cup every morning, noon, and dinner time, he drinks \( x \) cups in the morning, \( x \) cups in the afternoon, and \( x \) cups at dinner. Therefore, he drinks \( 3x \) cups in a day.

On weekdays, he drinks \( 3x \) cups each day for 5 days, so he drinks \( 5 \times 3x = 15x \) cups in a week.

On weekends, he drinks soda instead of water at dinner time, so he drinks \( 3x \) cups in the morning, \( x \) cups in the afternoon, and \( x \) cups of soda at dinner. Therefore, he drinks \( 3x + x + x = 5x \) cups in a day.

On weekends, he drinks \( 5x \) cups each day for 2 days, so he drinks \( 2 \times 5x = 10x \) cups in a week.

To find out how many times more water he drinks in a week on weekdays compared to weekends, we calculate the ratio of the total amount of water he drinks on weekdays to the total amount of water he drinks on weekends:

\[ \frac{15x}{10x} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \]

So, John drinks $1.5$ times more water in a week on weekdays compared to weekends.",5,26

1. The total number of puzzle pieces is 1000.
2. Polly places 4/10 of the pieces on the board.
3. Polly's mother places 3/10 of the pieces on the board.
4. The remaining pieces are not placed on the board.

Let's calculate the number of pieces not placed on the board:

1. Polly places 4/10 of the pieces:
   \[
   \frac{4}{10} \times 1000 = 400 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. Polly's mother places 3/10 of the pieces:
   \[
   \frac{3}{10} \times 1000 = 300 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. The total number of pieces placed on the board is:
   \[
   400 + 300 = 700 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. The number of pieces not placed on the board is:

polymath-low-ja-107,"Let's break down the information provided in the question:

1. **Daily TV Viewing Schedule:**
   - **Monday and Tuesday:** Each day, Frankie watches 1 hour of his favorite episode.
   - **Wednesday:** Frankie watches 30 minutes of an episode.
   - **Thursday:** Frankie watches 1 hour of an episode and 30 minutes of another episode.
   - **Friday:** Frankie watches 2 hours of an episode.

2. **Total TV Viewing Time:**
   - Total time spent watching TV is 7 hours.

3. **Calculating the Time Spent on Each Episode:**
   - Let's denote the time spent on each hour-long episode as \( x \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time spent on each 30-minute episode is \( \frac{x}{2} \) minutes.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Total time spent on Monday and Tuesday: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - Total time spent on Wednesday: \( 30 \) minutes.
   - Total time spent on Thursday: \( 1 \times 60 + \frac{x}{2} = 60 + \frac{x}{2} \) minutes.
   - Total time spent on Friday: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.

5. **Summing Up the Time:**
   \[
   120 + 30 + 60 + \frac{x}{2} + 120 = 7 \times 60
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   330 + \frac{x}{2} = 420
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 420 - 330
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 90
   \]
   \[
   x = 180
   \]

6. **Calculating the Number of 30-Minute Episodes:**
   - Since each 30-minute episode is \( \frac{x}{2} \) minutes, the number of 30-minute episodes is:
   \[
   \frac{180}{\frac{x}{2}} = \frac{180}{90} = 2

After baking, he realizes he has baked 15 more cookies than he thought. If he removes 5 of the cookies he just baked and now has 110 cookies in total, how many cookies did he bake last year?

Answer: Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). According to the problem, he wants to bake twice this number, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies. After baking, he realizes he has baked 15 more cookies than he thought, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. If he removes 5 of the cookies he just baked and now has 110 cookies in total, we can set up the following equation:

\[ (2x + 15) - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. The answer is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50

If they ate all the rolls, how many rolls did they eat on average?

Now, let's calculate the total length of the fruit rolls they ate:

Bertrès' roll: 24 rolls long
Marcel's roll: 14 rolls long

Total length of rolls eaten = 24 + 14 = 38 rolls

Since they ate all the rolls, the average number of rolls they ate is:

Average = Total length of rolls eaten / Number of rolls eaten
Average = 38 rolls / 2 rolls (since they each ate one roll)
Average = 19 rolls

Therefore, the answer is 19 rolls.",19,45

polymath-low-ja-114,"English translation: Jamal's phone can save 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can save is 50 times the number of birds in the bird photos Jamal took at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can save 1800 photos, how many birds were in the photos he took at the zoo?

Let's denote the number of birds in the photos Jamal took at the zoo as \( x \).

According to the problem, the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can save is \( 50x \).

Since Jamal's phone can save 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, we have:
\[ 1800 = 6 \times 50x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1800}{6 \times 50} \]
\[ x = \frac{1800}{300} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of birds in the photos Jamal took at the zoo is \( \boxed{6} \).",6,6

Sarah noticed that the price of lumber had increased by 50% since she bought some of it. She decided to sell the remaining lumber. There were 10 pieces of 2x4 lumber at $10 each, and 5 pieces of 4x4 lumber at $16 each. If she sold everything, how much profit would she make?

Now, let's calculate the profit:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2x4 lumber:
   10 pieces * $10 per piece = $100

2. Calculate the total cost of the 4x4 lumber:
   5 pieces * $16 per piece = $80

3. Calculate the total cost of all lumber:
   $100 (2x4 lumber) + $80 (4x4 lumber) = $180

4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all lumber:
   10 pieces * $10 per piece (2x4 lumber) + 5 pieces * $16 per piece (4x4 lumber) = $100 + $80 = $180

5. Calculate the profit:
   Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0

polymath-low-ja-116,"English translation: Kate makes coffee by mixing coffee grounds, a small amount of sugar, and a small amount of hot water in a ratio of 7:13. If she used a total of 120 cups of sugar and water, how many cups of sugar did she use?

To solve this, we first need to understand the ratio 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of coffee grounds, there are 13 parts of sugar and water. Therefore, for every 20 parts (7 + 13), 7 parts are coffee grounds and 13 parts are sugar and water.

Given that the total mixture is 120 cups, we can calculate the amount of sugar as follows:

1. The total parts of the mixture are 20.
2. The parts of sugar are 13 out of these 20 parts.
3. Therefore, the amount of sugar is $\frac{13}{20} \times 120$ cups.

polymath-low-ja-119,"The question is already in English, so no translation is needed. Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the current salary of Rリア.
   - Let \( A \) be the current salary of Aidrian.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - Aidrian's current salary is 30% more than Rリア's salary:
     \[
     A = R + 0.3R = 1.3R
     \]
   - Aidrian's salary increases by 40% over the next 4 years:
     \[
     A_{\text{future}} = A \times (1 + 0.4) = 1.3R \times 1.4 = 1.82R
     \]

3. **Calculate the total salary for Aidrian and Rリア in 4 years:**
   - Let \( T \) be the total salary for both Aidrian and Rリア in 4 years.
   - Since Aidrian's salary increases by 40%, Rリア's salary also increases by 40%:
     \[
     T = A_{\text{future}} + R_{\text{future}}
     \]
   - Rリア's salary in 4 years:
     \[
     R_{\text{future}} = R \times (1 + 0.4) = 1.4R
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     T = 1.82R + 1.4R = 3.22R
     \]

4. **Determine the total salary if Aidrian and Rリア both have the same salary:**
   - Let \( S \) be the salary of each person if they both have the same salary.
   - Since Aidrian's current salary is 1.3 times Rリア's salary:
     \[
     S = 1.3R
     \]
   - If both have the same salary:
     \[
     T = 2S = 2 \times 1.3R = 2.6R
     \]

5. **Calculate the difference in total salary:**
   - The difference between the total salary if both have the same salary and the total salary if Aidrian's salary increases by 40%:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 3.22R - 2.6R = 0.62R
     \]

6. **Calculate the total salary if Aidrian and Rリア both have the same salary:**
   - Since the difference is 0.62R, we need to find the total salary when both have the same salary:
     \[
     T = 2.6R
     \]

7. **Calculate the total salary if Aidrian and Rリア both have the same salary:**

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees.
3. After 10 years, 30% of the trees will be cut down.

First, let's calculate the net growth of trees each year:
- Trees planted: 10
- Trees cut down: 2
- Net growth: 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years without considering the 30% cut:
- Initial number of trees: 50
- Net growth per year: 8
- Number of years: 10

Total trees after 10 years = Initial trees + (Net growth per year * Number of years)

= 50 + 80
= 130 trees

Now, we need to account for the 30% of trees that will be cut down:
- Percentage cut down: 30%
- Number of trees cut down = 30% of 130
- Number of trees cut down = 0.30 * 130
- Number of trees cut down = 39 trees

Finally, let's calculate the number of trees remaining:
- Total trees after 10 years: 130

   - On Sunday morning, they added 18 more pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

2. **Calculations:**
   - Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
   - After removing 1/3 of them, they removed \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) pink flamingos.

Gerry likes to walk along the ends of the local park, which is a rectangular shape measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at a pace of 3 miles per hour, how many hours will it take him to walk along the entire perimeter of the park?

To find out how many hours it will take Gerry to walk along the entire perimeter of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, since Gerry walks at a pace of 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it will take him to walk 15 miles by dividing the distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the calculation is:
500 (total customers on the third day) - 100 (customers on the first day) - 150 (customers on the second day) = 500 - 100 - 150 = 250

mgsm-ja-214,"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool as \( x \) gallons. According to the problem, the large pool initially had twice as much water as the small pool, so it had \( 2x \) gallons. The large pool leaks water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, and the small pool leaks water at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. 

The time elapsed since the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool is 4 minutes. So, the amount of water that has leaked out of the large pool is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Similarly, the amount of water that has leaked out of the small pool is \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) gallons.

Now, let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( y \) gallons. Since the large pool is now four times the amount of water in the small pool, the amount of water in the large pool is \( 4y \) gallons. The total amount of water in both pools combined is the initial amount of water in the small pool plus the amount of water that has leaked out, which is \( x + 16 \) gallons. This total amount of water is also equal to the initial amount of water in the large pool plus the amount of water that has leaked out, which is \( 2x + 8 \) gallons.

So, we have the equation:

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x + 16 = 2x + 8 \]
\[ 16 - 8 = 2x - x \]
\[ 8 = x \]

So, the initial amount of water in the small pool is 8 gallons. The current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ y = x = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins doing each activity from the total:

36 - (3/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36)

Let's calculate:

36 - (3/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36)
= 36 - (27) - (9) - (9)
= 36 - 45
= -9

Since we can't have a negative number of penguins, we need to re-evaluate our approach. The correct approach is to find the number of penguins that are not sunbathing, swimming, or eating, which is the same as the number of penguins that are still sunbathing.

36 - (3/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36)
= 36 - (27) - (9) - (9)
= 36 - 45
= -9

The correct answer is 36 - (3/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36) = 36 - 27 - 9 - 9 = 36 - 45 = -9.

Therefore, the answer is 36 - (3/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36) - (1/4 * 36) = 36 - 27 - 9 - 9 = 36 - 45 = -9.",-9,12

Let's break down the costs and profits:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue**: $1.5 per lemon * 7 lemons = $10.5 per year
3. **Annual Expenses**: $3 per year

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to break even, we need to calculate the net profit per year:

Net profit per year = Annual Revenue - Annual Expenses
Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90:

Number of years to break even = Initial Cost / Net profit per year
Number of years to break even = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Carlos will need 12 years to break even and start making a profit from the lemon tree. Therefore, the answer is:

In a dance class consisting of 20 students, 20% of the students are learning contemporary dance, and the remaining students are learning jazz dance. The rest are learning hip-hop dance. What percentage of the students are learning hip-hop dance?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of students learning hip-hop dance and then find the percentage of the total number of students.

1. Calculate the number of students learning contemporary dance:
   \[
   \text{Contemporary dancers} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]

2. Calculate the number of students learning jazz dance:
   \[
   \text{Jazz dancers} = 75\% \times 20 = 0.75 \times 20 = 15
   \]

3. Calculate the number of students learning hip-hop dance:
   \[
   \text{Hip-hop dancers} = 20 - (\text{Contemporary dancers} + \text{Jazz dancers}) = 20 - (4 + 15) = 20 - 19 = 1
   \]

4. Calculate the percentage of students learning hip-hop dance:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of hip-hop dancers} = \left(\frac{\text{Hip-hop dancers}}{\text{Total students}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{20}\right) \times 100 = 5\%

Answer: Let's denote the amount of water in the orange juice as \( W_{orange} \) and the amount of water in the pineapple juice as \( W_{pineapple} \). From the problem, we know that:

\[ W_{orange} = \frac{3}{2} \times 10 = 15 \text{ liters} \]
\[ W_{pineapple} = \frac{5}{3} \times 15 = 25 \text{ liters} \]

During the pouring process, 1 liter of the orange juice is spilled, so the remaining amount of water in the orange juice is \( 15 - 1 = 14 \) liters. The total amount of water in the final mixture is the sum of the remaining water in the orange juice and the water in the pineapple juice:

mgsm-ja-25,"Question: Mary ordered 1 chicken dish, 5 packs of milk, 4 packs of $1.50 apples, and some pizzas. She paid $50 in total. If a pizza costs $8.50, how many pizzas did Mary order?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken dish:**
   - Mary ordered 1 chicken dish.
   - The cost of the chicken dish is not given directly, but we can assume it is $x$.

2. **Calculate the cost of the milk:**
   - Mary ordered 5 packs of milk.
   - Each pack of milk costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   - Mary ordered 4 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs $1.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Let \(p\) be the number of pizzas Mary ordered.**
   - Each pizza costs $8.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the pizzas is \(8.50 \times p\).

5. **Set up the equation for the total cost:**
   - The total cost of all items is $50.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     x + 15 + 6 + 8.50p = 50
     \]

6. **Solve for \(p\):**
   - Combine the known costs:
     \[
     x + 21 + 8.50p = 50
     \]
   - Subtract 21 from both sides:
     \[
     x + 8.50p = 29
     \]
   - Since \(x\) is the cost of the chicken dish, and we don't have a specific value for \(x\), we can express \(p\) in terms of \(x\):
     \[
     8.50p = 29 - x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8.50:
     \[
     p = \frac{29 - x}{8.50}
     \]

Since the problem does not provide the cost of the chicken dish, we cannot determine the exact number of pizzas Mary ordered. However, if we assume the cost of the chicken dish is $0 (which is a common assumption in such problems if not specified), then:

\[
p = \frac{29 - 0}{8.50} = \frac{29}{8.50} = 3.41
\]

Since the number of pizzas must be a whole number, and typically in such problems, we assume the closest whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[
p = 3
\]

Therefore, the number of pizzas Mary ordered is \( \boxed{3} \).",3,2

2. **Calculate the cost of the long pants:**
   - The cost of one long pant is $22.50.
   - Since he bought 3 long pants, the total cost for the long pants is:
     \[
     3 \times 22.50 = 67.50

However, she has to choose between buying one pair of boots and two pairs of heels, with the condition that the total cost of the boots and two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the two pairs of heels. If one pair of heels costs $33, what is the price of the boots?

Answer: Let's denote the price of the boots as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the total cost of the boots and two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the two pairs of heels. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2 \times 33 = 2 \times 33 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ x + 66 = 66 - 5 \]
\[ x + 66 = 61 \]

Subtracting 66 from both sides:

\[ x = 61 - 66 \]
\[ x = -5 \]

However, this result is not possible because the price of the boots cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the total cost of the boots and two pairs of heels is $5 more than the cost of the two pairs of heels. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2 \times 33 = 2 \times 33 + 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ x + 66 = 66 + 5 \]
\[ x + 66 = 71 \]

Subtracting 66 from both sides:

\[ x = 71 - 66 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the price of the boots is $5.",5,104

mgsm-ja-33,"The question in English is:

Gretchen has 110 coins. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

To answer this question, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have:

1. \( G = S + 30 \) (the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins)
2. The total number of coins is 110, so \( G + S = 110 \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\( (S + 30) + S = 110 \)

Combining like terms, we get:

\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\( 2S = 80 \)

Divide by 2:

\( S = 40 \)

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by using the first equation:

- Raymonde has 40 jewels: R = 40

First, we can substitute the value of R into the equation for S:
S = 40 + 5 = 45

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John sells each of the 13 Lego sets for $15.
2. The total money from selling the Lego sets is $15 * 13 = $195.
3. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs him $20 * 8 = $160.
4. After buying the video games, he has $20 left.

Now, let's find out how much money John has in total:
- Total money from selling Lego sets: $195
- Money left after buying video games: $20

Total money John has = $195 + $20 = $215

Now, let's find out how many Lego sets he has left:
- Total money John has: $215
- Money spent on video games: $160

Money left after buying video games = $215 - $160 = $55

Since each Lego set is sold for $15, we can find out how many Lego sets he has left by dividing the remaining money by the price of one Lego set:
- Money left after buying video games: $55
- Price of one Lego set: $15

Number of Lego sets left = $55 / $15 = 3.666...

Dana can walk at a speed that is 4 times slower than her running speed. She can skip at half the speed she runs at. If she skips at half her running speed, she can do it for 3/1 of an hour. If she walks for 3/2 of an hour and skips for 3/1 of an hour, how many kilometers will she have traveled in 6 hours?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Dana will travel in 6 hours by walking and skipping.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - If skipping at half her running speed takes 3/1 of an hour, then skipping at full speed would take 1 hour.
   - Therefore, her running speed is 2 miles per hour (since skipping at half speed takes 1 hour).

2. **Calculate the distance Dana will walk in 3/2 of an hour:**
   - Walking speed is 1 mile per hour.
   - Distance walked = Walking speed * Time = 1 mile/hour * 3/2 hours = 3/2 miles.

3. **Calculate the distance Dana will skip in 3/1 of an hour:**
   - Skipping speed is 1 mile per hour.
   - Distance skipped = Skipping speed * Time = 1 mile/hour * 3/1 hours = 3 miles.

\[
\text{Total distance} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 1.5 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 4.5 \text{ miles}

mgsm-ja-42,"Question: John's grandmother baked 5 apple pies for the firewood sale. She cut each pie into 8 pieces and placed them on the buffet table. After everyone had taken their share, there were 14 pieces left. How many pieces did the guests eat?

Answer: Let's denote the number of pieces eaten by the guests as \( x \).

Initially, there were \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) pieces of apple pie on the buffet table. After the guests took their share, there were 14 pieces left. Therefore, the number of pieces eaten by the guests is:

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

So, the guests ate \( 26 \) pieces of apple pie.

mgsm-ja-43,"The question has been translated into English as follows:

According to nutritional information, a bag of potato chips contains 250 calories per serving. If your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, how many grams of potato chips can you eat if you have a bag of 300 grams that contains 5 servings?

Now, let's answer the question in English:

To find out how many grams of potato chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total calories in the bag and then subtract the calories you have already consumed.

The total calories in the bag is 300 grams * 250 calories/100 grams = 7500 calories.

Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, you can eat 7500 calories - 1800 calories = 5700 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many grams of potato chips contain 5700 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings in 5700 calories by dividing 5700 calories by 250 calories/serving.

Number of servings = 5700 calories / 250 calories/serving = 22.8 servings.

Since you can only eat whole servings, you can eat 22 servings of potato chips.

Finally, we need to calculate the total grams of potato chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving.

Total grams of potato chips = 22 servings * 300 grams/serving = 6600 grams.

Therefore, you can eat 6600 grams of potato chips.",6600,48
mgsm-ja-44,"Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of wax and wick for 20 candles:**
   - Each candle requires 1 pound of wax and 1 pound of wick.
   - Wax costs $10.00 per pound.
   - Wicks cost $10.00 per pound.
   - Therefore, the total cost for wax and wicks for 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times (1 \text{ pound wax} + 1 \text{ pound wick}) = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - The total cost for wax and wicks is:
     \[
     40 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$400.00
     \]

2. **Determine the revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
   - Therefore, the profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$400.00 = -\$360.00

Last week, she wrote 5 posts on Monday, 2/5 times as many on Tuesday, and a number of posts that is a multiple of the number she wrote on Tuesday on Wednesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing posts in the three days.

Answer: Let's denote the number of posts Medis wrote on Tuesday as \( x \). According to the problem, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5}x \) posts on Wednesday. The total number of hours she spent writing posts in the three days is given by:

\[
4 \times 5 + 4 \times \frac{2}{5}x + 4 \times \left(\frac{2}{5}x\right) = 20 + \frac{8}{5}x
\]

To find the total number of hours spent writing posts, we need to determine the value of \( x \). Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we can assume the simplest case where \( x \) is a multiple of 5. Let's choose \( x = 5 \) for simplicity.

Substituting \( x = 5 \) into the equation:

\[
20 + \frac{8}{5} \times 5 = 20 + 8 = 28

To find out how many slices of pizza John should order, we need to calculate the total number of slices needed for all his friends and then divide by the number of slices per pizza.

Total slices needed = Number of friends × Slices per person
Total slices needed = 20 × 4 = 80 slices

Now, we need to determine how many slices of pizza this corresponds to. Since each slice is made of 8 slices, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

Number of pizzas = Total slices needed ÷ Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 ÷ 8 = 10 pizzas

1. Let's denote the ages of Mary, John, and Jess as \( M \), \( J \), and \( S \) respectively.
2. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
   - Mary is 2 years younger than John: \( M = J - 2 \)
   - John is 5 years older than Jess: \( J = S + 5 \)
   - Jess is 20 years old: \( S = 20 \)
3. Substitute \( S = 20 \) into the second equation to find John's age:

Answer: Let's denote the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday as \( S \) and on Tuesday as \( T \). From the information given:

- On Monday, \( S = 5 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, \( T = 13 \) cookies.

Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so \( S = 2T \). We can substitute \( T \) with 13:

\[ S = 2 \times 13 = 26 \]

So, Sue ate 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate:

- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies

Total cookies Sue ate: \( 5 + 26 = 31 \) cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed are:

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate:

- Monday: 5 cookies

Total cookies her sister ate: \( 5 + 13 = 18 \) cookies.

The total calories her sister consumed are:

\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we find the difference in calories between Sue and her sister:

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: $80,000
2. **Cost of Repairs**: $50,000
3. **Total Cost**: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000
4. **Increase in Value**: 150% of the initial purchase price
   - 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
5. **Total Value After Repairs**: $130,000 (initial cost) + $120,000 (increase in value) = $250,000

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total Value After Repairs - Initial Purchase Price
- Profit = $250,000 - $80,000 = $170,000

1. **Determine the number of sprints per week:**
   - James decides to run 3 sprints per week.

2. **Determine the distance of each sprint:**
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.

3. **Calculate the total distance for one sprint:**
   - Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance for one sprint is 60 meters.

4. **Calculate the total distance for 3 sprints:**
   - Since James runs 3 sprints per week, the total distance for 3 sprints is:
     \[
     3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters}

5. **Determine the number of weeks in a month:**
   - Assuming a month has 4 weeks, James runs 3 sprints per week for 4 weeks.

6. **Calculate the total distance for 4 weeks:**
   - Since James runs 180 meters per week for 4 weeks, the total distance for 4 weeks is:
     \[
     4 \text{ weeks} \times 180 \text{ meters/week} = 720 \text{ meters}

2. Feed given in the morning = 15 cups
3. Feed given in the afternoon = 25 cups
4. Remaining feed for the third feeding = Total feed - Feed given in the morning - Feed given in the afternoon

How many sheep are there in total if Turuーズ has twice the number of sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has four times the number of sheep as Seattle? If there are 20 sheep in Seattle, how many sheep are there in total?

Let's denote:
- The number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \).
- The number of sheep in Charleston as \( C \).
- The number of sheep in Turuーズ as \( T \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S = 20 \) (Seattle has 20 sheep).
2. \( C = 4S \) (Charleston has four times the number of sheep as Seattle).
3. \( T = 2C \) (Turuーズ has twice the number of sheep as Charleston).

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Turuーズ:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we find the total number of sheep:

Carla is downloading a 200 gigabyte file. Normally, she can download at a speed of 2 gigabytes per minute. However, when she reaches 40% of the file, Windows updates cause her to restart for 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla starts over from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file and then add the time it takes for the restart and the download time after the restart.

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 gigabytes is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) gigabytes.
   - At a speed of 2 gigabytes per minute, it takes \( \frac{80 \text{ gigabytes}}{2 \text{ gigabytes per minute}} = 40 \) minutes to download 40% of the file.

2. **Time for the restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - The remaining 60% of 200 gigabytes is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) gigabytes.
   - At a speed of 2 gigabytes per minute, it takes \( \frac{120 \text{ gigabytes}}{2 \text{ gigabytes per minute}} = 60 \) minutes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

4. **Total time to download the file:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to download 40%, the restart time, and the time to download the remaining 60%.
   - Total time = \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).

Answer: Let's denote the number of years it takes for Carlos to start making a profit as \( x \).

The total cost of planting the lemon tree is $90.

The total revenue from selling lemons over \( x \) years is \( 7 \times 1.5 \times x = 10.5x \) dollars.

The total cost of watering and fertilizing the tree over \( x \) years is \( 3x \) dollars.

For Carlos to start making a profit, the revenue must be greater than the total cost. So we set up the inequality:

\[ 10.5x > 90 + 3x \]

Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:

\[ 7.5x > 90 \]

Divide both sides by 7.5:

\[ x > \frac{90}{7.5} \]

\[ x > 12 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, Carlos will start making a profit after 13 years.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{13} \).",13,13

Melany is a visiting salesperson. Among the cleaning machines being sold, 1/3 of the green house, 2 machines from the red house, and half of the orange house, she sold. If there are 5 cleaning machines left in her possession, how many cleaning machines did she start with?

### 英文解答

Let's denote the total number of cleaning machines sold as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the green house was sold, so \( \frac{1}{3}x \) green machines were sold.
- 2 machines from the red house were sold.
- Half of the orange house was sold, so \( \frac{1}{2}x \) orange machines were sold.

The total number of machines sold is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}x + 2 + \frac{1}{2}x \]

The number of machines left is:
\[ x - \left( \frac{1}{3}x + 2 + \frac{1}{2}x \right) = 5 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x - \left( \frac{2}{6}x + 2 + \frac{3}{6}x \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \left( \frac{5}{6}x + 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{5}{6}x - 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{6}x - 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{6}x = 7 \]
\[ x = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of cleaning machines Melany started with is \( \boxed{42} \).",42,18

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of students**: 20
2. **Percentage of students learning contemporary dance**: 20%
3. **Percentage of students learning jazz dance**: 25%

\[ \text{Number of students learning contemporary dance} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \]

Next, calculate the number of students learning jazz dance:
\[ \text{Number of students learning jazz dance} = 20 \times \frac{25}{100} = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of students learning hip-hop dance:
\[ \text{Number of students learning hip-hop dance} = 20 - 4 - 5 = 11 \]

Finally, calculate the percentage of students learning hip-hop dance:

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

According to the problem, Kai paid 75% of the original price, which is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.",0,26

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items other than the pizza:
   - $12 for chicken
   - $3 × 5 = $15 for milk
   - $1.5 × 4 = $6 for grapes

2. Now, add these amounts to find the total cost of the other items:
   $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

3. We know that the total amount paid was $50, so the cost of the pizza is:
   $50 - $33 = $17

4. The cost of one box of pizza is $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza is:
   $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2.",2,2

Answer: We need to calculate the total number of servings Stephanie will eat in 60 days. Since she eats one serving per night, in 60 days she will eat $60$ servings.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of servings} \times \text{Cost per serving}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 60 \times 4 = 240

1. Henry travels 60 miles in total.

3. The second stop is 15 miles from the end of his journey.

To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the second stop from the distance to the second stop.

First, let's find the distance to the second stop from the end of the journey:
60 miles (total) - 20 miles (first stop) = 40 miles

Now, we know the second stop is 15 miles from the end of the journey. So, the distance between the first and second stops is:
40 miles (to the second stop from the end) - 15 miles (to the second stop from the first stop) = 25 miles

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The price of one pair of heels is $33.
   - The price of two pairs of heels is twice the price of one pair of heels, so it is $66.
   - The total budget for the shoes is $5 less than the price of two pairs of heels, which is $66 - $5 = $61.

2. **Determine the price of one pair of boots:**
   - Let's denote the price of one pair of boots as \( B \).
   - The price of two pairs of boots is \( 2B \).
   - We know that \( 2B = 66 \) (price of two pairs of heels).
   - Therefore, \( B = \frac{66}{2} = 33 \).

3. **Calculate the total budget:**
   - The total budget is $61.

Another says there are half as many as the first person's answer plus 20. The third person says there are 25% more than the first person's answer. What is the average of the three guesses?""

### Solution:
1. First, let's calculate the second person's guess:
   - The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.
   - The second person guessed 80 / 2 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.

2. Now, let's calculate the third person's guess:
   - The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.
   - The third person guessed 80 + 25% of 80 = 80 + 0.25 * 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

3. Finally, let's find the average of the three guesses:
   - The average is (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80 jelly beans.

So, the average of the three guesses is $80$.",80,80
