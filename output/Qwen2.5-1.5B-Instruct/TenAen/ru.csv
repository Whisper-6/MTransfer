mgsm-ru-47,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount John spent on the gowns. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the blue gowns:**
   - John spent $200 on blue gowns, and each blue gown costs $40.
   - Therefore, the number of blue gowns John bought is:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue gowns} = \frac{\text{Total cost of blue gowns}}{\text{Cost per blue gown}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the red gowns:**
   - John bought two times as many red gowns as blue gowns.
   - Therefore, the number of red gowns John bought is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red gowns} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue gowns} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of the red gowns:**
   - Each red gown costs 50% more than each blue gown.
   - Therefore, the cost of each red gown is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per red gown} = \text{Cost per blue gown} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red gowns:**
   - The total cost of the red gowns is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of red gowns} = \text{Number of red gowns} \times \text{Cost per red gown} = 10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of all gowns:**
   - The total cost of all gowns is the sum of the cost of the blue gowns and the cost of the red gowns:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of all gowns} = \text{Total cost of blue gowns} + \text{Total cost of red gowns} = 200 + 600 = 800
     \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on gowns is $800.

mgsm-ru-49,"To determine the total number of unfurnished apartments in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the building.
2. Determine the number of apartments that are occupied.
3. Subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of unfurnished apartments.

First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments is:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many apartments are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate the number of occupied apartments as follows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Now, we subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of unfurnished apartments:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unfurnished apartments in the building is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]",30,30
mgsm-ru-50,"English translation: Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens lay 252 eggs per day, and he sells them by the dozen for $2 each. How much does Lloyd earn from eggs per week?

To find out how much Lloyd earns from eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Lloyd sells in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Lloyd sells in one week.
3. Calculate the total earnings from eggs per week.

Step 1: Number of eggs sold in one day
Lloyd sells 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Number of eggs sold in one week
There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs sold in one week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from eggs per week
Lloyd sells the eggs by the dozen, so each dozen contains 12 eggs. The number of dozens sold in one week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Since each dozen sells for $2, the total earnings per week are:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earns $294 from eggs per week.",294,294

First, we need to calculate the distance the ship travels in the first part of its journey. The ship travels from 13:00 to 16:00, which is a duration of 3 hours. At a speed of 10 miles per hour, the distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance the ship travels in the second part of its journey. The ship travels from 16:00 back to 13:00, which is also a duration of 3 hours. At a speed of 6 miles per hour, the distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 6 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance the ship travels is the sum of the two distances:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 18 \, \text{miles} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

The time taken to travel this distance is the total distance divided by the average speed. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total time is the sum of the two travel times:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \, \text{hours} + 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{hours} \]

The average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{48 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{hours}} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

The time taken to return is the total distance divided by the average speed:
\[ \text{Time to Return} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{48 \, \text{miles}}{8 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 6 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, the time taken for the ship to return is $6$ hours.",6,5

mgsm-ru-53,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue for both days and then determine the difference in revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue for Thursday.**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 passenger car tires.
- The revenue from truck tires is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The revenue from passenger car tires is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue for Friday.**
- The mechanic repairs 12 passenger car tires.
- The revenue from passenger car tires is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires.
- Therefore, the total revenue for Friday is \(480\) dollars.

**Step 3: Determine the difference in revenue between the two days.**
- The difference in revenue is \(480 - 520 = -40\) dollars.
- Since the difference is negative, it means the mechanic made less money on Friday than on Thursday. The question asks for the difference in revenue, so we need to consider the absolute value of the difference, which is \(40\) dollars.

If the top level of the 4-level sandcastle has an area of 16 square feet, then each level below it has half the area of the level above it. Therefore, the second level has an area of 16 / 2 = 8 square feet, the third level has an area of 8 / 2 = 4 square feet, and the bottom level has an area of 4 / 2 = 2 square feet. 

To find the average area of the levels, we add up the areas of all the levels and divide by the number of levels:

(16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet.

If Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sara, and Sara washes 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash, if Sara washes 400 pounds of laundry.

**Answer:**
Let's denote the amount of laundry David washes as \( D \) pounds. According to the problem, Sara washes 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sara washes \( 4D \) pounds of laundry. Additionally, Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sara, so Raymond washes \( \frac{4D}{2} = 2D \) pounds of laundry.

We are given that Sara washes 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 4D = 400 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond washes:
\[ 2D = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash is:
\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \]

Therefore, the difference is \( \boxed{200} \) pounds.",200,100

2. Emi (E) is 2 years younger than Korri (K).
3. James (D) is 10 years old.
4. James (D) is 1 year younger than Korri (K).

First, we can express the ages of Emi and Jackson in terms of Jackson's age:
\[ E = J + 5 \]
\[ E = K - 2 \]

Since James is 10 years old, we can substitute this into the equations:
\[ D = 10 \]
\[ E = K - 2 \]

Since James is 1 year younger than Korri, we have:

\[ 10 = K - 1 \]
\[ K = 11 \]

Now, we can find Emi's age:
\[ E = K - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Since Emi is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age:

If Tim can skate at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Solution:

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile = 5280 feet:

1. **Translation:**
   - Дейв купил большую упаковку ломтиков картошки-фри и съел четырнадцать, пока голодная чайка не украла упаковку из его руки.
   - Когда чайка приземлилась, она выхватила половину от количества ломтиков картошки, которое съел Дейв.
   - Затем три голубя прогнали ее от еды, и каждый голубь съел три ломтика.
   - После этого енот украл две трети оставшихся ломтиков картошки.
   - Муравьи унесли последний ломтик картошки, оставив пять штук.
   - Сколько ломтиков картошки-фри было в упаковке, когда Дейв купил ее?

2. **Solving the problem:**
   - Let's denote the total number of potato chips in the package as \( x \).
   - After Deyv ate 14 chips, the number of chips left was \( x - 14 \).
   - The chook took half of Deyv's chips, so it took \( \frac{x - 14}{2} \) chips.
   - After the chook took its share, there were \( x - 14 - \frac{x - 14}{2} = \frac{x - 14}{2} \) chips left.
   - Three robins took three chips each, so they took \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) chips.
   - After the robins took their chips, there were \( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \) chips left.
   - The bear took two-thirds of the remaining chips, so it took \( \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) \) chips.
   - After the bear took its share, there were \( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 - \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) \) chips left.
   - The ants took the last chip, leaving 5 chips.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 - \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) = 5

Blake runs to the goal and back 15 times. Kelly runs to the goal and back once, and then decides she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther did the winner run compared to the loser?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Blake's total distance:**
   - Blake runs to the goal and back 15 times.
   - Distance to the goal = 100 yards.
   - Distance back = 100 yards.
   - Total distance for one round trip = 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.
   - Total distance for 15 rounds = 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.

2. **Kelly's total distance:**
   - Kelly runs to the goal and back once.
   - Distance to the goal = 100 yards.
   - Distance back = 100 yards.
   - Total distance for one round trip = 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.
   - Total distance for 34 rounds = 34 * 200 yards = 6800 yards.

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Difference = Kelly's total distance - Blake's total distance.
   - Difference = 6800 yards - 3000 yards = 3800 yards.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

Let's denote the original price as \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars.

The price after the first two months will be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \times 1.20 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The price after the next two months (four months total) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.20) = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.80 \text{ dollars} \]

The price after the next two months (six months total) will be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 + 0.20) = 28.80 \times 1.20 = 34.56 \text{ dollars} \]

We can see that the price increases by a factor of 1.20 every two months. To find the price after 36 months, we need to determine how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \text{Number of two-month periods in 36 months} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

The price after 36 months will be:
\[ P_{36} = P_0 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 11.16 \]

Therefore, the price after 36 months will be:
\[ P_{36} = 20 \times 11.16 = 223.20 \text{ dollars} \]

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payments.
2. Find 50% of the total minimum monthly payments.
3. Add this amount to the total minimum monthly payments to get the total annual payment.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payments:
   - Minimum credit card payment: $200
   - Minimum loan payment: $500
   - Total minimum monthly payments = $200 + $500 = $700

2. Find 50% of the total minimum monthly payments:
   - 50% of $700 = 0.50 * $700 = $350

3. Add this amount to the total minimum monthly payments to get the total annual payment:
   - Total annual payment = $700 + $350 = $1050

Therefore, Jessica will pay $1050 in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payments. The answer is $1050.",1050,18000

mgsm-ru-175,"Let's start by calculating the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 gallons of lemonade at $0.50 per gallon, so the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.50/\text{gallon} = \$10.00 \]

Let's denote the cost of one gallon of lemonade as \( C \). We know that the cost of one gallon includes the cost of 3 pounds of lemons and 2 pounds of sugar. Therefore, the cost of one gallon is:
\[ C = 3 \text{ pounds of lemons} + 2 \text{ pounds of sugar} \]

They also received $25 in profit. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is the cost of 20 gallons of lemonade:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ gallons} \times C \]

The profit is given by:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - 20C \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):
\[ 25 = 10 - 20C \]
\[ 20C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ 20C = -15 \]
\[ C = -\frac{15}{20} \]
\[ C = -\frac{3}{4} \]

The cost of one gallon of lemonade is $0.75. Since the cost of one gallon includes the cost of 3 pounds of lemons, the cost of lemons per gallon is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons per gallon} = 3 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ 20 \text{ gallons} \times 2.25 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Sander ordered 200 red roses, which is five times the number of white violets.
3. Sander threatens to change suppliers if the red roses are not delivered by 5 PM.

To find out how many red roses Sander should expect to be delivered by 5 PM, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( W \) represent the number of white violets.
Then, \( 4W \) represents the number of red roses.

According to the information given:

So, Sander ordered 50 white violets.

Now, we need to find out how many red roses are expected to be delivered by 5 PM. Since the red roses are delivered in batches, we can assume that the delivery time is consistent with the delivery of the white violets.

Therefore, Sander should expect to receive 200 red roses by 5 PM. This is because the problem states that the red roses are delivered in batches of 200, and the delivery time is consistent with the delivery of the white violets.

Thus, the number of red roses that should be delivered by 5 PM is $200$.",200,160

Let's denote:
- Mark's current age as \( M \)
- Jin's current age as \( J \)
- Yang's current age as \( Y \)

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( J = M + 2 \) (Jin is two years older than Mark)
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \)
3. Two years ago, Yang's age was \( Y - 2 \)

The two track and field teams compete in a 4x400 meter relay. Each team consists of four runners, each running 400 meters, or one lap, on a standard circular track. One of the two teams is well-prepared, and each of its runners completes their 400-meter lap in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less prepared; its first runner completes their lap in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner runs 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

Question: Jerry throws a six-sided die. How much more likely (in percentage) is it that he will roll a number greater than 3 than that he will roll two consecutive even numbers?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events:

1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
2. The probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2 and 4. The probability of rolling an even number is:

\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{2}{6} = 0.3333 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is:

\[ P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = 0.3333 \times 0.3333 = 0.1111 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities

The difference in probabilities is:

\[ \Delta P = P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = 0.5 - 0.1111 = 0.3889 \]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage

\[ \Delta P\% = 0.3889 \times 100 = 38.89\% \]

3. **Rabbits**: Let's denote the number of rabbits by \( R \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
- There are 10 hare cages, each containing one hare. So, \( H = 10 \).
- Each hare gets 5 brikets of straw. So, the total number of brikets for hares is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 160 brikets of straw in total. So, the remaining brikets are for solomons and rabbits. The number of brikets for solomons and rabbits is \( 160 - 50 = 110 \).
- There are 3 solomons cages, each containing one solon. So, \( S = 3 \).
- Each solon gets 6 brikets of straw. So, the total number of brikets for solomons is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
- The remaining brikets are for rabbits. So, the number of brikets for rabbits is \( 110 - 18 = 92 \).

Now, we need to find out how many solomons are in each solon cage. Let's denote the number of solomons in each solon cage by \( x \). Then, the total number of brikets for solomons is \( 3x \). We know that \( 3x = 18 \), so \( x = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of solomons in each solon cage is \( \boxed{6} \).",6,5

\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 5 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 120 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Now, we multiply this by three to find the total internal volume for all three boxes:

\[ \text{Total internal volume} = 3 \times 120 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

\[ \text{Total internal volume} = 360 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

So, the total internal volume of all three boxes is $360$ cubic inches.",360,72

1. **Determine the total time spent watching TV:**
   - On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour shows each night, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
   - On Thursday, he watched 1-hour and 30-minute shows, which is \(1 + \frac{30}{60} = 1.5\) hours.
   - On Friday, he watched 2 1-hour shows, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
   - On Saturday, he watched 1-hour shows, which is \(1\) hour.
   - On Sunday, he watched 30-minute shows, which is \(1\) hour.

   Adding these up, the total time spent watching TV is:
   \[
   2 + 1.5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Convert the total time spent watching TV into minutes:**
   Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the total time in minutes is:
   \[
   7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the time spent watching 30-minute shows:**
   - On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour shows, which is 60 minutes each night, so he watched \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes on Monday and Tuesday.
   - On Thursday, he watched 1.5 hours, which is \(1.5 \times 60 = 90\) minutes.
   - On Friday, he watched 2 hours, which is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - On Saturday, he watched 1 hour, which is \(1 \times 60 = 60\) minutes.
   - On Sunday, he watched 1 hour, which is \(1 \times 60 = 60\) minutes.

   Adding these up, the total time spent watching 30-minute shows is:
   \[
   120 + 90 + 120 + 60 + 60 = 490 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of 30-minute shows:**
   Since each 30-minute show is 30 minutes long, the number of 30-minute shows he watched is:
   \[
   \frac{490}{30} = 16.3333 \approx 16 \text{ shows}
   \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute shows he watched on Wednesday is $\boxed{16}$.",16,3
mgsm-ru-108,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cakes Henry planned to bake in the past by \( x \).
2. According to the problem, Henry wants to bake twice as many cakes as he did last year, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cakes.
3. When he finishes baking, he realizes he has baked 15 more cakes than he planned, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cakes.
4. He then drops 5 cakes, so the number of cakes he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. The problem states that he now has 110 cakes, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110 \implies 2x = 100 \implies x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cakes in the past. The answer is $50$.",50,50

In the application of one company, there is a cashback offer of $0.20 per gallon when filling at this station. If you buy 10 gallons of gasoline, how much will it cost after receiving the cashback?

Calculation:
- The cost of 10 gallons of gasoline without cashback is $3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00
- The cashback for 10 gallons of gasoline is $0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Marcel and Beatrice compete to see who can eat more fruit rolls, so they roll all the rolls they can find. Unfortunately, someone made a mistake, and Beatrice's roll was 2 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, while Marcel's roll was 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long. If they ate all this amount, how many rolls on average would they have eaten?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total length of the rolls and then divide by the number of rolls to find the average length.

First, calculate the total length for each person:
- Beatrice's roll: 24 rolls * 3 rolls/roll = 72 rolls
- Marcel's roll: 14 rolls * 24 rolls/roll = 336 rolls

Now, add these together to get the total number of rolls:
72 rolls + 336 rolls = 408 rolls

Next, divide the total number of rolls by the number of people to find the average length:
408 rolls / 2 people = 204 rolls

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{204}$ rolls.",204,45
mgsm-ru-111,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water was added to the boat as it was being pushed back to the shore. We know that every 10 feet of travel, 2 liters of water are added to the boat. Additionally, we know that it took 16 seconds to travel 20 feet, which means it took 64 seconds to travel 64 feet (since 64 feet is 32 times 20 feet).

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 10-foot segments are in the total distance:
\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 6.4 \text{ segments} \]

Since the boat adds 2 liters of water for every 10 feet traveled, we can calculate the total amount of water added by multiplying the number of 10-foot segments by 2 liters:
\[ \text{Total water added} = 6.4 \text{ segments} \times 2 \text{ liters/segment} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the answer is $12.8$ liters.",8,16

In Jamal's phone, there can be 6 times more photos than in Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos in Brittany's phone is 50 times the number of ducks in the photo that Jamal took at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, how many ducks are in the photo that Jamal took at the zoo?

### Answer:
Let's denote the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took at the zoo as \( D \).

According to the problem, the maximum number of photos in Brittany's phone is 50 times the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took at the zoo. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{Maximum number of photos in Brittany's phone} = 50D \]

We are also given that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos. Since Jamal's phone can be 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, we can write:
\[ \text{Number of photos in Jamal's phone} = 6 \times \text{Maximum number of photos in Brittany's phone} \]
\[ 1800 = 6 \times 50D \]
\[ 1800 = 300D \]
\[ D = \frac{1800}{300} \]
\[ D = 6 \]

1. **Identify the cost and selling price of each type of wood:**
   - Each 2x4 x 10 piece costs $10.
   - Each 4x4 x 10 piece costs $16.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the wood Sash has:**
   - Sash has 10 pieces of 2x4 x 10 each, so the total cost for these pieces is \(10 \times 10 = 100\) dollars.
   - Sash also has 5 pieces of 4x4 x 10 each, so the total cost for these pieces is \(5 \times 16 = 80\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost of all the wood is \(100 + 80 = 180\) dollars.

3. **Determine the total revenue from selling the wood:**
   - Sash will sell all 15 pieces of wood at their selling price. Since the problem does not specify the selling price, we assume she sells them at the cost price for simplicity.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the wood is \(180\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \(180 - 180 = 0\) dollars.

Thus, the profit Sash will make is $0.

Давайте решим это пошагово:

1) Начнем с того, что мы знаем, что 7 чайных ложек сахара соответствуют 13 чашек воды.

2) Это значит, что 1 чайная ложка сахара соответствует 13/7 чашек воды.

3) Теперь, если Кейти использовала всего 120 чайных ложек сахара, то количество чашек воды, которое она использовала, будет:

If their salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrian's salary was $40,000 four years ago, calculate their combined salary after four years.

Let's denote Adrian's salary four years ago as \( A \) and Layla's salary as \( L \). According to the problem, \( A = 40,000 \) dollars.

Four years later, Adrian's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A = 1.4 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Layla's salary also increased by 40%, so her new salary is:
\[ L_{\text{new}} = L + 0.4L = 1.4L \]

The combined salary of Adrian and Layla after four years is:
\[ \text{Combined salary} = A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 56,000 + 1.4L \]

Since L is the same as \( A \) (Adrian's salary four years ago), we have:
\[ L = 40,000 \]

Substituting \( L \) into the combined salary equation:
\[ \text{Combined salary} = 56,000 + 1.4 \times 40,000 = 56,000 + 56,000 = 112,000 \text{ dollars} \]

   - On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than on Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours Seyed slept from Monday to Wednesday:**

She stuck labels on one third of the letters without labels. If now in the box with already labeled letters there are 30 letters, then how many letters were in this box when Jenny started working?

To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of letters in the box with already labeled letters as \( x \).

According to the problem, Jenny stuck labels on one third of the letters without labels. Therefore, the number of letters without labels is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

The total number of letters in the box with already labeled letters is the sum of the letters without labels and the letters with labels. This gives us the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} + x = 30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} + \frac{3x}{3} = 30 \]

   - He sells 20 candles.
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the raw materials:**
   - He uses 100 grams of honey per candle.
   - He has 200 grams of honey.
   - Each gram of honey costs $0.10.
   \[
   \text{Cost of honey} = 200 \text{ grams} \times \$0.10/\text{gram} = \$20.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the fuses:**
   - He uses 10 fuses per candle.
   - He has 200 fuses.
   - Each fuse costs $10.00.
   \[
   \text{Cost of fuses} = 200 \text{ fuses} \times \$10.00/\text{fuse} = \$2000.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of honey} + \text{Cost of fuses} = \$20.00 + \$2000.00 = \$2020.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$40.00 - \$2020.00 = -\$1980.00
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is $-\$1980.00$.",0,20
polymath-low-ru-45,"English translation: Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health as her main job and sends the written content to her clients every day. On average, it takes her 4 hours to study and write a blog post. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and twice as many articles on Tuesday as on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles over three days.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Articles: 5

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Articles: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Articles: \(2 \times 10 = 20\)

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days:

- **Monday:**
  - Hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)

- **Tuesday:**
  - Hours: \(10 \times 4 = 40\)

- **Wednesday:**
  - Hours: \(20 \times 4 = 80\)

**Total hours spent:**
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days is $140$.",140,104
polymath-low-ru-46,"Let's denote the number of stickers in the pack as \( x \).

Initially, Kendis had 80 stickers in her purse. After buying the pack, she had \( 80 + x \) stickers. At the workplace, she placed one sticker on each of 220 different coffee cups, which means she used up 220 stickers. After placing the stickers, she had 23 stickers left. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

Adding 140 to both sides of the equation, we find:

\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of stickers in the pack is \( \boxed{163} \).",163,163

   - Each box weighs 15 pounds.
   - There are 3755 pounds of cargo (driver + empty truck).

2. **Calculate the total weight of the cargo and the driver:**
   - Total weight = 3755 pounds (driver) + 15 pounds (each box) * number of boxes
   - Let \( n \) be the number of boxes.
   - Total weight = 3755 + 15n

3. **Set up the inequality for the maximum weight the bridge can handle:**
   - The bridge can handle a maximum of 5000 pounds.
   - Therefore, we have the inequality: \( 3755 + 15n \leq 5000 \)

4. **Solve the inequality for \( n \):**
   - Subtract 3755 from both sides: \( 15n \leq 5000 - 3755 \)
   - Simplify: \( 15n \leq 1245 \)

### Step 1: Pension after 20 years

The pension after 20 years is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Pension after 20 years} = 50,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{20} \]

### Step 2: Pension after 30 years

After 20 years, the pension increases by 5% annually. So, the pension after 30 years is:

2. Calculate the pension after 30 years:
\[ \text{Pension after 30 years} = \text{Pension after 20 years} \times (1.05)^{10} \]

Now, let's compute the values:

1. Calculate \( (1.05)^{20} \):
\[ (1.05)^{20} \approx 2.6533 \]

2. Calculate the pension after 20 years:

1. **Determine the time spent on each activity per week:**
   - Time spent on the first activity (watching TV): 2 hours
   - Time spent on the second activity (reading): \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) hours = 1 hour

   So, the total time spent on both activities per week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent on both activities in 4 weeks:**
   - Time spent on both activities in 4 weeks:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the time spent on each activity in 4 weeks:**
   - Time spent on watching TV in 4 weeks:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent on reading in 4 weeks:

polymath-low-ru-67,"Let's denote the number of rubies as \( R \), the number of diamonds as \( D \), and the number of emeralds as \( E \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of diamonds is 35 less than the number of rubies:
\[ D = R - 35 \]

2. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies:
\[ E = 2R \]

3. The total number of stones (diamonds and rubies) is 175:
\[ D + R = 175 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( D \) and \( E \) into the equation \( D + R = 175 \), we get:
\[ (R - 35) + R = 175 \]
\[ 2R - 35 = 175 \]
\[ 2R = 210 \]
\[ R = 105 \]

Now we can find the number of diamonds and emeralds:
\[ D = R - 35 = 105 - 35 = 70 \]
\[ E = 2R = 2 \times 105 = 210 \]

The total number of stones in the satchel is:

- Since \( K = 11 \), we can write \( E = K - 2 \). Substituting \( K = 11 \), we get \( E = 11 - 2 = 9 \).

However, we already calculated \( E = 15 \) from the first equation. This means there is a contradiction in the problem statement or in the interpretation of the information. Let's recheck the problem statement and the interpretation.

Given the problem statement, let's assume the correct interpretation is that Emi is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Korri, and James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Korri. Let's recheck the ages:

- If James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Korri, then Korri is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) years old.
- If Emi is 5 years older than Jackson, then Jackson is \( 11 - 5 = 6 \) years old.
- If Emi is 2 years younger than Korri, then Korri is \( 11 + 2 = 13 \) years old.

This is consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

polymath-low-ru-93,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Speed Comparison:**
   - Let \( L \) be the initial speed of Li.
   - Let \( J \) be the initial speed of Gerald.
   - According to the problem, \( L = J + 2 \) (Li is 2 seconds faster than Gerald).

2. **Speed Increase Due to Diet:**
   - Gerald's speed increases by 10%, so his new speed \( J' \) is \( J' = J + 0.1J = 1.1J \).

3. **Time for Li to Run 400 Metres with Obstacles:**
   - Li's speed is \( L = J + 2 \).
   - Time taken by Li to run 400 metres with obstacles is \( t_L = \frac{400}{L} \).

4. **Time for Gerald to Run 400 Metres with Obstacles:**
   - Gerald's new speed is \( J' = 1.1J \).
   - Time taken by Gerald to run 400 metres with obstacles is \( t_J = \frac{400}{J'} = \frac{400}{1.1J} \).

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We know \( t_L = 38 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{400}{J + 2} = 38 \).

6. **Solving for \( J \):**
   - \( 400 = 38(J + 2) \)
   - \( 400 = 38J + 76 \)
   - \( 38J = 324 \)
   - \( J = \frac{324}{38} = 8.4117647 \) (approximately).

7. **Calculating \( t_J \):**
   - \( t_J = \frac{400}{1.1J} = \frac{400}{1.1 \times 8.4117647} \approx \frac{400}{9.25294117} \approx 43.2 \) seconds.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{43.2} \) seconds.",2,36

     \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls who are members of the scout association:**
   - The fraction of girls who are members of the scout association is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
   - Therefore, the number of girls who are members of the scout association is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of girls who are not members of the scout association:**
   - The number of girls who are not members of the scout association is the total number of girls minus the number of girls who are members of the scout association:

\[ 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

Now, let's calculate Layla's salary four years ago:
\[ L_0 = \frac{56000}{1.30} = 43076.92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate their combined salary four years later:

1. **Determine the number of fruits each person brought:**
   - **Mizette:** 
     - Apples: 8
     - Oranges: 5
     
   - **Kayla:** 
     - Apples: 2 * 8 = 16 (twice as many as Mizette)
     - Oranges: 1/2 * 5 = 2.5 (half of what Mizette brought, but since we can't have half a fruit, we'll round to the nearest whole number, which is 2)
     
   - **Total fruits:**
     - Mizette's total: 8 (apples) + 5 (oranges) = 13
     - Kayla's total: 16 (apples) + 2 (oranges) = 18
     
   - **Combined total:**

polymath-low-ru-122,"English translation: In Monday, Seydi slept for 8 hours. In each of the following two days, she slept 2 hours less than she did on Monday because she needed to finish some assignments. If at the end of the week she slept 1 hour more than in these two days, how many hours did she sleep in this week?

Let's denote the number of hours Seydi slept on Tuesday and Wednesday as \( x \) hours each. According to the problem, she slept \( x - 2 \) hours on Tuesday and \( x - 4 \) hours on Wednesday.

The total hours she slept from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ 8 + (x - 2) + (x - 4) = 8 + 2x - 6 = 2x + 2 \]

The total hours she slept from Monday to Wednesday and the next day (Thursday) is:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 2x + 3 \]

The total hours she slept from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 2x + 3 + 1 = 2x + 4 \]

Since the total hours she slept from Monday to Friday is the same as the total hours she slept from Monday to Wednesday and the next day (Thursday), we have:
\[ 2x + 4 = 2x + 3 \]

This equation is not possible, which means there must be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

If she slept 8 hours on Monday and 2 hours less on Tuesday and Wednesday, then she slept \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) hours on Tuesday and \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) hours on Wednesday. The total hours she slept from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 \]

If at the end of the week she slept 1 hour more than in these two days, then she slept \( 18 + 1 = 19 \) hours in total for the week.

Therefore, the total hours she slept in this week is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]",19,48
polymath-low-ru-123,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance that Rosa can run in 7 hours. We can break this down into two parts: the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours.

1. **Distance in the first 3 hours:**
   - Rosa's speed in the first 3 hours is 10 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance she runs in the first 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Distance in the remaining 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosa's speed decreases to 5 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total distance:**
   - The total distance Rosa can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances from the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}

polymath-low-ru-124,"English translation: Jenny helps her mom at the office. She has a box containing 60 letters, of which she needs to stick labels on. She has another box with letters already labeled. She stuck labels on one third of the letters without labels. If now there are 30 letters with labels in the box with labeled letters, how many letters were there in this box when Jenny started working?

Let's denote the number of letters without labels in the box with labeled letters as \( x \). According to the problem, Jenny stuck labels on one third of these \( x \) letters, so she stuck labels on \( \frac{x}{3} \) letters. The total number of letters in this box is then \( x + \frac{x}{3} = \frac{4x}{3} \).

We know that the total number of letters in the box with labeled letters is 30, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{4x}{3} = 30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ 4x = 90 \]

Then we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{90}{4} = 22.5 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number (as you can't have half a letter), we need to re-evaluate the problem. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's assume the problem meant that the total number of letters in the box with labeled letters is 30, and we need to find the original number of letters in that box before labeling.

If the total number of letters in the box with labeled letters is 30, and these letters were labeled from the original box, then the original number of letters in that box must be:
\[ 30 + \frac{30}{3} = 30 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the original number of letters in the box with labeled letters was 40.

First, we calculate the total cost of purchasing the mешков:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20x \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of transporting the mешков from the farmer's farm to the trader's store:
\[ \text{Transport cost} = 2x \]

The trader's total cost for purchasing and transporting the mешков is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The trader's total revenue from selling the mешков is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 30x \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 30x - 22x = 8x \]

We know the trader's profit is $400:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per proposal, and Publisher B pays him twice as much, which is 10 cents per proposal. The total amount he earns per week is the sum of his earnings from both publishers, which can be expressed as:

The formula for the weighted average is:

\[
\text{Weighted Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}}

We want the weighted average to be 93, so we set up the equation:

\[

\]

First, we calculate the sum of the scores from the first five exams:

\[
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

\[
93 \times 6 = 438 + x

""Twenty dozen plates cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates that cost $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of buying one plate.""

Let's break it down:

1. Let the cost of one plate be \( x \) dollars.
2. The cost of half a dozen plates (6 plates) is \( 6x \).
3. The cost of twenty dozen plates is \( 20 \times 12x = 240x \).
4. According to the problem, twenty dozen plates cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates:
   \[
   240x = 6x - 1200

   \]
   \[
   234x = -1200
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{-1200}{234} = \frac{-1200}{234} = \frac{-1200 \div 6}{234 \div 6} = \frac{-200}{39}

The small pool loses water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so after 4 minutes, the volume of water in the small pool is \( x - 4 \times 4 = x - 16 \) gallons.

The large pool loses water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so after 4 minutes, the volume of water in the large pool is \( 2x - 4 \times 4 = 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x - 16 = 2(x - 16) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x - 16 = 2x - 32 \]
\[ -16 = -32 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2x - 16 = 2x - 32 \]
\[ -16 = -32 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, the volume of water in the small pool is \( x = 16 \) gallons.

Now, the volume of water in the large pool is \( 2x = 2 \times 16 = 32 \) gallons.

The problem also states that now the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:

1. Janet's initial loan amount is $2000.
2. She agreed to add 10% to this amount, so the additional amount is $2000 * 10% = $200.
3. Therefore, the total amount Janet will repay is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after 12 months of payments:

1. Janet pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount paid is $165 * 12 = $1980.

2. Harry is half the age of Zak: \( H = \frac{Z}{2} \).

We also know that Harry is currently 21 years old, so \( H = 21 \).

First, we can find Zak's current age using the second relationship:
\[ H = \frac{Z}{2} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{Z}{2} \]
\[ Z = 21 \times 2 \]
\[ Z = 42 \]

Now, we can find Adrian's current age using the first relationship:

\[ A = 3 \times 21 \]
\[ A = 63 \]

Next, we need to find the ages of Adrian, Harry, and Zak three years from now. Three years from now, their ages will be:

\[ H_{\text{future}} = H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 \]
\[ Z_{\text{future}} = Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45 \]

The average age of Adrian, Harry, and Zak three years from now is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A_{\text{future}} + H_{\text{future}} + Z_{\text{future}}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} \]

1. **Total number of chows per day:**
   - Each day, Venny gives 15 chows in the morning.
   - She gives 25 chows in the afternoon.
   - Therefore, the total number of chows given per day is:
     \[
     15 + 25 = 40 \text{ chows}
     \]

2. **Number of chows per chicken per day:**
   - There are 20 chickens in the flock.
   - Each chicken gets 40 chows per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of chows needed for all chickens per day is:
     \[
     40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ chows}
     \]

3. **Chows given in the last meal:**
   - Each chicken gets 3 chows per meal.
   - There are 3 meals per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of chows given per day is:
     \[
     3 \times 20 \times 3 = 180 \text{ chows}

4. **Chows needed for the last meal:**
   - The total number of chows given per day is 800.
   - The total number of chows given in the last meal is 180.
   - Therefore, the number of chows needed for the last meal is:
     \[
     800 - 180 = 620 \text{ chows}

mgsm-ru-6,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city and then sum them up. Let's denote the number of sheep in Silette as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of sheep in Toulouse is twice the number of sheep in Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).
2. The number of sheep in Charleston is four times the number of sheep in Silette, so \( C = 4S \).
3. The number of sheep in Silette is 20, so \( S = 20 \).

First, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80. \]

Next, we substitute \( C = 80 \) into the equation for \( T \):
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160. \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260. \]

- The cost of one apple is $1.50.
- The cost of one box of pizza is $8.50.

Mari ordered 5 packs of milk, 4 apples, and an unknown number of boxes of pizza. Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza as \( x \).

The total cost of the items is given as $50. We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[
12 + 5 \times 3 + 4 \times 1.50 + 8.50 \times x = 50

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of the milk:
\[

2. The price of the second pair of high-heeled shoes is \( 2x \) dollars.
3. The total price of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is \( x + 2x = 3x \) dollars.
4. The price of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is $5 less than the price of the two pairs of boots.
5. Therefore, the price of the two pairs of boots is \( 3x + 5 \) dollars.
6. The price of one pair of boots is \( \frac{3x + 5}{2} \) dollars.
7. We know that the price of one pair of boots is $33, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3x + 5}{2} = 33
   \]
8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   3x + 5 = 66 \implies 3x = 61 \implies x = \frac{61}{3}
   \]
9. The price of one pair of boots is \( \frac{61}{3} \) dollars, so the price of two pairs of boots is:
   \[
   2 \times \frac{61}{3} = \frac{122}{3} \approx 40.67
   \]
10. The price of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is $5 less than the price of the two pairs of boots, so the price of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is:
    \[
    \frac{122}{3} - 5 = \frac{122}{3} - \frac{15}{3} = \frac{107}{3} \approx 35.67
    \]
11. The price of one pair of high-heeled shoes is:
    \[
    \frac{107}{3} \div 2 = \frac{107}{6} \approx 17.83
    \]
12. Therefore, the price of one pair of boots is $33, and the price of one pair of high-heeled shoes is $17.83.

1. The first friend guesses \( x = 80 \).
2. The second friend guesses that the number of marzipan candies is 20 more than half of what the first friend guessed. So, the second friend's guess is:

""Grétchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Grétchen have?""

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. \( G + S = 110 \) (total number of coins)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the second equation:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Grétchen has 70 gold coins. The answer is $70$.",70,70

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's work, including the discount, and then determine how much the actress paid.

1. Calculate the total hours of makeup application:
   - Each day, it takes 6 hours to apply makeup.
   - She applies makeup 4 times a week.
   - There are 5 weeks in the film.

   Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

2. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   - The cost per hour is $250.

   Total cost = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

3. Calculate the discount:
   - The discount is 10%.

   Discount amount = $30,000 * 10% = $3,000

4. Calculate the final amount paid by the actress:
   - Subtract the discount from the total cost.

   Final amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Therefore, the answer is $27,000.",0,27000

mgsm-ru-249,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of cookies Sissy ate on Monday:**
   - Sissy ate 5 cookies on Monday.
   - Sissy ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday.
   - Therefore, her sister ate \( \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \) cookies on Monday.

2. **Determine the number of cookies Sissy ate on Tuesday:**
   - Sissy ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   - Sissy ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{2} = 6.5 \) cookies on Tuesday.

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies Sissy ate:**
   - Total cookies on Monday: 5
   - Total cookies on Tuesday: 13
   - Total cookies eaten by Sissy: \( 5 + 13 = 18 \) cookies

4. **Calculate the total number of cookies Sissy's sister ate:**
   - Cookies eaten by Sissy's sister on Monday: 1.25
   - Cookies eaten by Sissy's sister on Tuesday: 6.5
   - Total cookies eaten by Sissy's sister: \( 1.25 + 6.5 = 7.75 \) cookies

5. **Calculate the difference in calories consumed:**
   - Calories per cookie: 200
   - Calories consumed by Sissy: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \) calories
   - Calories consumed by Sissy's sister: \( 7.75 \times 200 = 1550 \) calories
   - Difference in calories: \( 3600 - 1550 = 2050 \) calories

Therefore, Sissy consumed $2050$ calories more than her sister.",2050,
polymath-low-ru-0,"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Daily production**: The question states that the duck Jenny lays 16 eggs per day.
2. **Eggs eaten for breakfast**: Jenny eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. **Eggs used for cakes**: Jenny uses 4 eggs to make cakes each day.
4. **Eggs sold at the market**: The remaining eggs are sold at the market.

Let's calculate the remaining eggs:

- Total eggs laid per day: 16
- Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
- Eggs used for cakes: 4
- Remaining eggs: \( 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \)

Now, we need to calculate how much Jenny earns from selling these eggs at the market:

- Price per egg: $2
- Total earnings from selling eggs: \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \)

Therefore, Jenny earns $18 from selling eggs at the market every day.

1. Calculate the total cost of the house after the renovation.
2. Determine the selling price of the house.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the selling price.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house after the renovation:**
   - Initial cost of the house: $80,000
   - Amount spent on renovation: $50,000
   - Total cost after renovation: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Determine the selling price of the house:**
   - The renovation increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - This means the selling price is 250% of the total cost after renovation.
   - Selling price = 250% of $130,000 = 2.5 * $130,000 = $325,000

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Selling price - Total cost
   - Profit = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

Therefore, the profit from the house sale is $195,000.",0,70000

- Let \( S_T \) be the number of sheep in Toulouse.
- Let \( S_C \) be the number of sheep in Charleston.
- Let \( S_S \) be the number of sheep in Seattle.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. In Toulouse, there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston:
   \[
   S_T = 2 \cdot S_C
   \]
2. In Charleston, there are four times as many sheep as in Seattle:
   \[
   S_C = 4 \cdot S_S
   \]
3. In Seattle, there are 20 sheep:
   \[
   S_S = 20
   \]

First, we substitute \( S_S = 20 \) into the equation for \( S_C \):
\[
S_C = 4 \cdot 20 = 80
\]

Next, we substitute \( S_C = 80 \) into the equation for \( S_T \):
\[
S_T = 2 \cdot 80 = 160
\]

Now, we know the number of sheep in each city:
- Toulouse: \( S_T = 160 \)
- Charleston: \( S_C = 80 \)
- Seattle: \( S_S = 20 \)

To find the total number of sheep in all three cities, we sum these values:
\[
S_T + S_C + S_S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is:

polymath-low-ru-17,"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both her teaching and her cherrilatin' coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks in a year.
- Her hourly rate for teaching is $20.

\[
\text{Earnings from teaching} = 35 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} \times 20 \, \text{\$/hour}
\]

\[
\text{Earnings from teaching} = 35 \times 50 \times 20

Next, let's calculate her earnings from cherrilatin' coaching:
- She works 15 hours per week as a cherrilatin' coach.
- She works 50 weeks in a year.
- Her hourly rate for cherrilatin' coaching is $30.

\[
\text{Earnings from cherrilatin' coaching} = 15 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} \times 30 \, \text{\$/hour}

polymath-low-ru-19,"The question is already in English, so no translation is necessary.

To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the total distance and the total time spent on the trip.

1. The total distance is 12 miles.
2. The time spent on the first 4 miles is 1 hour.
3. The time spent on the next 2 miles is 1 hour.
4. The remaining distance is 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 miles.
5. The total time spent is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
6. The desired average speed is 4 miles per hour.

Let's denote the speed for the remaining 6 miles as \( v \) miles per hour. The time spent on these 6 miles is \( \frac{6}{v} \) hours.

The total time spent on the trip is the sum of the time spent on the first 6 miles and the time spent on the remaining 6 miles:
\[ 1 + 1 + \frac{6}{v} = 2 + \frac{6}{v} \]

The total distance is 12 miles, and the total time is 2 hours. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

We set the average speed equal to the desired average speed:
\[ 6 = 4 + \frac{6}{v} \]

Solving for \( v \):
\[ 6 - 4 = \frac{6}{v} \]
\[ 2 = \frac{6}{v} \]
\[ v = \frac{6}{2} \]
\[ v = 3 \]

So, the speed needed to reach the desired average speed is $3$ miles per hour.

I have 10 liters of an apple juice that is two-thirds water. I want to add it to 15 liters of a pineapple juice that is one-third water. But when I pour, I spill one liter of apple juice. How much water is left in the remaining 24 liters?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the amount of water in the apple juice and the pineapple juice before and after the spill.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the apple juice:**
   - The apple juice is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the apple juice is:
     \[
     \text{Water in apple juice} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple juice:**
   - The pineapple juice is one-third water, so the amount of water in the pineapple juice is:
     \[
     \text{Water in pineapple juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill:**
   - The total amount of water before the spill is the sum of the water in the apple juice and the pineapple juice:
     \[
     \text{Total water before spill} = \frac{20}{3} + 5 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{15}{3} = \frac{35}{3} \approx 11.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water after the spill:**
   - One liter of apple juice is spilled, so the amount of water in the apple juice after the spill is:
     \[
     \text{Water in apple juice after spill} = \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \approx 5.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water after the spill:**
   - The total amount of water after the spill is the sum of the water in the pineapple juice and the remaining water in the apple juice:
     \[
     \text{Total water after spill} = 5 + \frac{17}{3} = \frac{15}{3} + \frac{17}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.67 \text{ liters}

The total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is given as 5 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 5 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{5}{3} \]

So, the price of one pair of high-heeled shoes is \( \frac{5}{3} \) dollars. The price of one pair of high-heeled shoes is twice the price of the first pair of high-heeled shoes, so the price of the first pair of high-heeled shoes is:
