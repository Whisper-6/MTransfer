mgsm-en-47,"Let's denote the cost of a blue tie as \( B \) and the cost of a red tie as \( R \). According to the problem, the cost of a blue tie is $40, so \( B = 40 \). John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so if he buys \( x \) blue ties, he buys \( 2x \) red ties. The cost of the blue ties is $200, so we have:

\[ x \cdot B = 200 \]
\[ x \cdot 40 = 200 \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

So, John buys 5 blue ties and \( 2 \cdot 5 = 10 \) red ties. The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie, so:

\[ R = B + 0.5B = 1.5B = 1.5 \cdot 40 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of blue ties} = 5 \cdot 40 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \cdot 60 = 600 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount John spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

mgsm-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs produced per day:**
   Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

2. **Convert the daily egg production into dozens:**
   Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
   \[
   \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. Therefore, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
   \[
   21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily earnings by 7:

mgsm-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM, we need to calculate the total distance he travels and then use the speed to find the time.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 PM to 4 PM. The distance is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

From 1 PM to 4 PM is a span of 3 hours. The speed is 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance traveled from 1 PM to 4 PM is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM. The speed is 6 miles per hour. The distance is the same, 30 miles. The time can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

First, we calculate the total weight of the comic books. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Therefore, the weight of the toys he needs to remove is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys \( T \) that need to be removed is:
\[ T = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys.",15,15

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight:

\[ \text{Combined weights} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]

mgsm-en-84,"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we have the equation:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games. The final answer is:

1. Calculate the number of vacations Gene has been on.
2. Determine the number of blocks from each year of vacations.
3. Sum the blocks from all the years.

First, we calculate the number of vacations Gene has been on. Since he goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, we need to find out how many years have passed since he was 23. The number of years is:

\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years} \]

Since he has been on four vacations a year, the total number of vacations is:

\[ 11 \times 4 = 44 \text{ vacations} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of blocks from each year of vacations. Since each year has a different number of blocks, we need to know the number of blocks for each year. However, the problem does not specify the number of blocks for each year, so we assume that the number of blocks for each year is a constant value, say \( b \). Since the problem does not provide this information, we cannot determine the exact number of blocks from each year, but we can still calculate the total number of blocks if we assume a constant value for \( b \).

If we assume that each year has the same number of blocks, and since the problem does not specify the number of blocks for each year, we can only calculate the total number of blocks if we assume a constant value for \( b \). However, since the problem does not provide this information, we cannot determine the exact number of blocks from each year, but we can still calculate the total number of blocks if we assume a constant value for \( b \).

Since the problem does not provide the number of blocks for each year, we cannot determine the exact number of blocks from each year, but we can still calculate the total number of blocks if we assume a constant value for \( b \).

3. Determine the salary after three more years.

First, the initial salary of Sylvie is $600.

Next, we calculate the salary increase for each of the next three years. The salary increase is 10% of the initial salary, which is $600. Therefore, the increase in salary each year is:

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}

- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. James is 10 years old.
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey.

First, let's use the information about James:
\[ I = 10 \]

Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, we can write:
\[ C = I + 1 \]
\[ C = 10 + 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now, we know Corey's age:
\[ C = 11 \]

Next, we use the information that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time was \( G - 2 \) seconds. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald originally took 40 seconds to run the 400-meter hurdles. With his diet, his speed improved by 10%. To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we need to calculate 110% of 40 seconds. This can be done by multiplying 40 by 1.10:

1. **Monkeys:**
   - The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - Over 2 months, the monkeys will need:
     \[
     200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}
     \]

2. **Gorillas:**
   - The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - Over 2 months, the gorillas will need:
     \[
     400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}

mgsm-en-157,"To determine how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, the distance for one round trip is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
So, the distance Blake runs in 15 round trips is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for one round trip is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
So, the distance for the initial round trip is 200 yards. The distance for the 34 round trips to the 40-yard line and back is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 6800 \text{ yards} \]
Adding these together, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards} + 6800 \text{ yards} = 7000 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances run by Blake and Kelly:
\[ 7000 \text{ yards} - 3000 \text{ yards} = 4000 \text{ yards} \]

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, so we can use the formula for compound interest to find the final price.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% of $20 every two months, which means the price after each two months is multiplied by 1.20 (or 120%).

First, let's calculate the price after 12 months (which is 6 two-month periods):
\[ \text{Price after 12 months} = 20 \times 1.20^6 \]

Next, we calculate the price after 24 months (which is another 6 two-month periods):
\[ \text{Price after 24 months} = 20 \times 1.20^6 \times 1.20^6 = 20 \times 1.20^{12} \]

Finally, we calculate the price after 36 months (which is another 6 two-month periods):
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 1.20^{12} \times 1.20^6 = 20 \times 1.20^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.20^{18}\). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ 1.20^{18} \approx 8.858 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ 20 \times 8.858 \approx 177.16 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price is $177.16.

Therefore, the final answer is:

2. \( A = 5 \) (since an action figure costs $5)

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car. So, the cost of the doll \( D \) can be expressed as:

\[ D = 3A + R \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( R \):

\[ D = 3 \times 5 + 4 \]
\[ D = 15 + 4 \]
\[ D = 19 \]

Now, we need to find the total value of all the toys. The total value \( T \) is the sum of the values of the red cars, action figures, and the doll:

\[ T = R + 3A + D \]
\[ T = 4 + 3 \times 5 + 19 \]

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Next, we need to convert the time to cut one potato into minutes to make the calculation easier:

First, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade. The total number of glasses sold per gallon is 20, and they sell each glass for $0.50, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling \( g \) gallons of lemonade is:

4. Calculate the amount Zaid donates to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation to charity.
6. Subtract the amount given to his daughter and his wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent. His salary is $6000, so:
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500

2. Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel. So:
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
   \]

3. The remaining amount after paying rent and car fuel is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
   \]

4. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his charity. So:
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
   \]

5. The remaining amount after the donation to charity is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250

First, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ J = M + 2 \]

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. So, two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \), and half of Jean's age was \( \frac{J - 2}{2} \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{J - 2}{2} \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( J = M + 2 \)
2. \( M - 2 = \frac{J - 2}{2} \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( M \):
\[ M - 2 = \frac{(M + 2) - 2}{2} \]
\[ M - 2 = \frac{M}{2} \]
\[ 2(M - 2) = M \]
\[ 2M - 4 = M \]
\[ M = 4 \]

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

First, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

Next, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}

\[ J = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother, we add the number of apples each picked:

\[ J + 20 = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters.
2. Determine the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits.
3. Use the information about the rats to find out how many rats are in each cage.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Next, let's determine the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits is:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Now, let's find out how many pieces of straw are left for the rats. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160, and we have already accounted for 50 pieces for the hamsters and 20 pieces for the rabbits. Therefore, the number of pieces of straw left for the rats is:
\[ 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of rats is:
\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 15 rats and they are kept in 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]",5,5

mgsm-en-94,"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The problem states that the number of dogs is 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   We are given that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs and the number of cats:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = (\text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats}) - 12 = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is $\boxed{348}$.",348,348

2. Calculate the number of girls in the class.
3. Determine how many of the girls are in the Girl Scout.
4. Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the Girl Scout.

First, we calculate the number of boys:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Then, we determine how many of the girls are in the Girl Scout:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, we find the number of girls not in the Girl Scout:

Therefore, Harry slept $3$ more hours than James.",3,3
mgsm-en-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make the 32 ounces of sauce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce. This means that for every 16 ounces of tomatoes, the sauce produced is 8 ounces.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used**: Since the sauce produced is 32 ounces, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to make this amount of sauce. This can be calculated by dividing the total volume of the sauce by the volume of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 2 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of tomatoes used**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:

mgsm-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through, and 5 cars exit the line. The number of cars remaining on the motorway after 15 minutes is:

\[ 30 - x + 20 - 5 = 45 - x \]

We need to determine the value of \( x \) such that the number of cars remaining on the motorway is a non-negative integer. Since the number of cars on the motorway must be a non-negative integer, we have:

\[ 45 - x \geq 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x \leq 45 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum possible value for \( x \) is 45. However, we need to check if this value is feasible given the conditions of the problem. If \( x = 45 \), then the number of cars remaining on the motorway would be:

\[ 45 - 45 = 0 \]

This means that all 30 cars would have driven through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, and no cars would have driven through in the second 15 minutes. The problem states that 20 more cars drive through in the second 15 minutes, but since all 30 cars have already driven through in the first 15 minutes, this condition is not possible.

Therefore, the maximum feasible value for \( x \) is 40. Let's check if \( x = 40 \) is feasible:

If \( x = 40 \), then the number of cars remaining on the motorway after 15 minutes is:

\[ 30 - 40 + 20 - 5 = 5 \]

This means that 40 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, and 20 more cars drove through in the second 15 minutes. This is a valid scenario, and the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of potted plants she gives away from the total number of potted plants she has:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

Let \( B \) represent the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Therefore:
\[ 1800 = 6 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} \]
\[ B = 300 \]

Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let \( N \) represent the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Therefore:
\[ B = 50 \times N \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50 \times N \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides by 50:
\[ N = \frac{300}{50} \]
\[ N = 6 \]

The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \( N \), which is 6.

Therefore, the number of ducks seen in Jamal's photograph is \( \boxed{6} \).",6,6

mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

First, we need to find out how many ""units"" of the ratio correspond to the total amount of sugar used. Since the ratio is 7:13, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many units of the ratio correspond to 120 teaspoons of sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{13} = \frac{120}{x}
\]

Here, \(x\) represents the total number of units of the ratio that correspond to 120 teaspoons of sugar. To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
7x = 13 \times 120
\]

\[
7x = 1560
\]

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

\[
x = \frac{1560}{7}
\]

\[
x = 222.857142857
\]

Since the number of units must be a whole number, we round 222.857142857 to the nearest whole number, which is 223. Therefore, the total number of units of the ratio that correspond to 120 teaspoons of sugar is 223.

Now, we need to determine how many teaspoonfuls of sugar correspond to 223 units of the ratio. Since the ratio is 7:13, each unit of the ratio is equivalent to 7 teaspoons of sugar. Therefore, the total number of teaspoonfuls of sugar is:

\[
223 \times 7 = 1561
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{1561}\).",1561,42

After the first day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is the difference between the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day and the number of vehicles imported on the first day:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

- Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.
- Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% compared to what it was four years ago.

First, we calculate Adrien's salary four years ago:
\[ A = 40000 \]

Next, we find Lylah's salary four years ago. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. According to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's:
\[ A = 1.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

Now, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40%:
\[ \text{Increase} = 0.4 \times 40000 = 16000 \]
\[ \text{New Salary} = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later is also $56000.

Finally, we find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:

First, we calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hours are left after the first 3 hours:

Finally, we add the distances from both segments to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}

polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the distances she covers while running and walking. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Dana's skipping rate is half as fast as her running rate. If her skipping rate is 3 miles per hour, then her running rate is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that Dana's running rate is four times her walking rate. If her walking rate is \( w \) miles per hour, then her running rate is \( 4w \). Since her running rate is 6 miles per hour, we can find her walking rate as follows:
\[ 4w = 6 \]
\[ w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the six hours running and two-thirds of the six hours walking. Therefore, the time spent running is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

The distance Dana can travel while running is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance Dana can travel while walking is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]",18,18

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks needed to make 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**

Each candle is sold for $2.00. Therefore, the revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks needed to make 20 candles.**

First, determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles will require:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \div 10 \text{ candles per pound} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \$10.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit is:

3. Sum up the total number of articles written over the three days.
4. Multiply the total number of articles by the average time it takes to write one article.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Number of articles on Tuesday:**
   - She wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.
   - Monday: 5 articles
   - Tuesday: \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \)

Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) post-it notes. At work, she placed one post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, so she used up 220 post-it notes. After placing the post-it notes on the cups, she had \( 80 + x - 220 \) post-it notes remaining.

According to the problem, after placing the post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

polymath-low-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the blue ties.
2. Determine the cost of the red ties.
3. Calculate the total cost of the blue ties.
4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
5. Sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total amount spent.

First, let's calculate the cost of the blue ties. John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]
The cost of the blue ties is $200.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the red ties. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the red ties cost:
\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars each}
\]
Therefore, the cost of the 10 red ties is:
\[
10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total amount spent:
\[
200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[

2. Convert the daily egg production into dozens of eggs.
3. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
4. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to find the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs produced per day.
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Convert the daily egg production into dozens of eggs.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Step 3: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

First, we calculate the cost for the first half of the year. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. The cost per month for the first half of the year is $140. Therefore, the total cost for the first half of the year is:
\[
140 \times 6 = 840
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The second half of the year also consists of 6 months. The cost per month for the second half of the year is 10% less than the cost per month for the first half of the year. A 10% reduction means the cost per month for the second half of the year is:

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount of money she receives from her allowance is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total includes her initial amount plus the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Given:
- The top level has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels as follows:
- Level 1: \( A_1 \)
- Level 2: \( A_2 \)
- Level 3: \( A_3 \)
- Level 4: \( A_4 \)

We know:
\[ A_4 = 16 \]

Since each level below has half the square footage of the level above it:
\[ A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ A_2 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ A_1 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

polymath-low-en-103,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, we can use this information to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles.

First, we calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:
\[
\frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
\]
Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time required to cover the entire city is:

\[
24 \times 24 = 576

1. Calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water.
2. Determine the total distance rowed.
3. Calculate the total amount of water taken on based on the rate and distance.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. The problem states that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total distance rowed. The problem states that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Since the rate of rowing is not given, we can infer that the time taken to row 20 feet is a consistent rate. However, the problem does not provide the time taken to row 20 feet, so we will assume that the time taken to row 20 feet is the same as the time taken to row any given distance, which is not necessary for the calculation of the water taken on.

The total distance rowed is 20 feet. Now, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by the boat:
\[
\text{Total water taken on} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Distance} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \text{ liters}

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is:

\[ 5x \]

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is the sum of the vehicles imported on the first day and the vehicles imported on the second day. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A_0 = 1.30 L_0 \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 L_0 \]
\[ L_0 = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

The total cost of the tickets and food is therefore \( 3T + (3T - 4.50) = 6T - 4.50 \).

The problem also states that they went on 2 rides, each costing $33, so the total cost of the rides is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \). The total cost of all expenses is the sum of the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides, which is \( 6T - 4.50 + 66 \). According to the problem, this total cost is $20.25, so we can set up the equation:

2. Convert the weekly amount to a daily amount.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the weekly amount to a daily amount. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

1. Calculate the net change in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Account for the trees that die after 10 years.

First, let's calculate the net change in the number of trees each year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net change is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Tom has after 10 years. Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years is:

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 240x = 34800 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 240:

1. Calculate the new total number of cards after the changes.
2. Determine the new number of water type cards.
3. Calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card.

First, let's find the new total number of cards:
- James originally has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is \(40 - 8 = 32\).
- He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is \(20 + 14 = 34\).
- The number of fire type cards remains 30.
- Therefore, the new total number of cards is \(30 + 34 + 32 = 96\).

Next, we calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:
- The number of water type cards is 32.
- The total number of cards is 96.
- The percentage chance is \(\frac{32}{96} \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\).

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is \(33\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{33}\).",33,33

First, let's find the rate at which Kalinda can add pieces. Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.

Next, let's find the rate at which her mom can add pieces. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. Therefore, her mom's rate is:
\[

3. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready to be harvested two weeks later.
4. Determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after she returned two weeks later.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn took home initially. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest, the number of watermelons she took home is:
\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \text{ watermelons} \]

After Ashlyn took the 36 watermelons home, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested is:

2. Determine the total cost of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

First, let's find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. The increase in value due to the repairs is 150% of the repair cost. Therefore, the increase in value is:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given to all chickens in the morning and afternoon.
2. Subtract this total from the total amount of feed given to all chickens in the day.

First, let's find the total amount of feed given to all chickens in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, each chicken gets 15 cups of feed, and there are 20 chickens.
  \[
  15 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 300 \text{ cups}
  \]
- In the afternoon, each chicken gets 25 cups of feed, and there are 20 chickens.
  \[

  \]
- Adding the morning and afternoon amounts:
  \[
  300 \text{ cups} + 500 \text{ cups} = 800 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how many cups of feed are given in the final meal. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day and there are 20 chickens, the total amount of feed given to all chickens in the day is:
\[
3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed given in the day to find the amount of feed given in the final meal:
\[
60 \text{ cups} - 800 \text{ cups} = -740 \text{ cups}
\]

Since it is not possible to have a negative amount of feed, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to find the total amount of feed given in the day and subtract the morning and afternoon amounts from this total. The correct calculation is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the second glass, which is 60% of the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the third glass, which is 60% of the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the third glass} = 0.60 \times 3 = \$1.80 \]

We continue this process for each subsequent glass. The cost of the \( n \)-th glass can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost of the } n\text{-th glass} = 5 \times (0.60)^{n-1} \]

To find the total cost for 16 glasses, we sum the costs of each glass from the first to the sixteenth:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 3 + 1.80 + 1.08 + 0.648 + 0.3328 + 0.16968 + 0.095808 + 0.0575248 + 0.03451488 + 0.020708928 + 0.0124253568 + 0.00745521744 + 0.004473120704 + 0.002736560352 + 0.001637936216 + 0.000982761704 \]

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[
\text{Increase in jewelry value} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125
\]
\[
\text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 + 125 = 5125

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She is paid $20 per hour for teaching.

Earnings from teaching = Number of weeks * Hours per week * Hourly rate
Earnings from teaching = 50 weeks * 35 hours/week * $20/hour
Earnings from teaching = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She works 15 hours a week as a cheerleading coach.
- She is paid $30 per hour for being a cheerleading coach.

Earnings from cheerleading coaching = Number of weeks * Hours per week * Hourly rate
Earnings from cheerleading coaching = 50 weeks * 15 hours/week * $30/hour
Earnings from cheerleading coaching = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from both positions to get her total annual salary:
Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from cheerleading coaching

First, we know that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. According to the problem, her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Dana spends one-third of her six-hour trip running and two-thirds of her trip walking. Therefore, the time she spends running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time she spends walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana covers while running and walking. The distance she covers while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she covers while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance Dana travels in six hours is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

This distance is the difference between the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone and the dragon's reach:

\[
1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Polly can stand $200$ feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the javelin. The final answer is:

mgsm-en-43,"First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag and each serving has 250 calories, we multiply 5 by 250 to get the total number of calories in the bag:

$$
5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories}
$$

Now, we know that you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily calorie target is 2000. To find out how many more calories you can eat, we subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target:

$$
2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
$$

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can eat:

$$
\frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings}
$$

Finally, we multiply the number of servings by the weight of each serving to find out how many grams you can eat:

$$
0.8 \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams}

1. **Calculate the total number of candles Charlie can make with 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks:**
   - For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles.
   - Therefore, for 20 pounds of beeswax, he can make:
     \[
     20 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ candles per pound} = 200 \text{ candles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 200 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 200 candles is:
     \[
     200 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$400.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks:**

mgsm-en-236,"To determine the total number of pens Ram gets, we need to understand the process he uses to make new pens. Ram can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. This means that for every pen he uses to make a new pen, he saves five pens.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. For each pen he uses to make a new pen, he saves 5 pens. So, for each pen he uses, he gets 6 pens in total (1 original pen + 5 saved pens).
3. To find out how many pens he gets in total, we need to determine how many sets of 6 pens he can make from 25 pens. This is given by the integer division of 25 by 6.

\[ \text{Number of sets} = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{6} \right\rfloor = 4 \]
This means he can make 4 sets of 6 pens, which gives him \(4 \times 6 = 24\) pens from the 25 pens he started with.

4. After making 24 pens, he will have \(25 - 24 = 1\) pen left over. This leftover pen can be used to make one more pen, but it won't save him any pens because he already has one pen left.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is:

2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 \times 0.60 = $3.
3. The cost of the third glass is 60% of $3, which is $3 \times 0.60 = $1.80.
4. The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of $1.80, which is $1.80 \times 0.60 = $1.08.
5. The cost of the fifth glass is 60% of $1.08, which is $1.08 \times 0.60 = $0.648.

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. This forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.60\).

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Here, \(n = 16\), \(a = 5\), and \(r = 0.60\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to account for the time he spends in traffic. He spends the first 2 hours in traffic, which means he does not travel any distance during this time. The remaining time he spends driving is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

During these 2 hours, he drives at a speed of 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, he drives the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance}_3 = 2 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 160 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance John has traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 180 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} + 160 \text{ miles} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

If John had driven continuously at 60 mph for 4 hours, the distance he would have traveled is:
\[ \text{Total Distance}_{\text{continuous}} = 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

The distance John is from home at the end of 4 hours is the difference between the distance he would have traveled if he had driven continuously and the distance he actually traveled:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 240 \text{ miles} - 300 \text{ miles} = -60 \text{ miles} \]

Since the distance cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:
\[ \boxed{60} \]",60,45

polymath-low-en-11,"To calculate the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen donuts costs $68.
   - Total cost of donuts = 3 dozen × $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Cost of mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.
   - Total cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozen × $80/dozen = $160.

- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

Therefore, the total cost of the pastries Toula bought is $694.",694,694
polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it will take to accumulate a profit of $90.

First, let's calculate the net profit per year:
- The tree grows 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue from selling lemons is:
  \[
  7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.50
  \]
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3. Therefore, the net profit per year is:
  \[
  \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50
  \]

Next, we need to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to accumulate a net profit of $90. We do this by dividing the total amount of money needed by the net profit per year:
\[
\frac{\$90}{\$7.50 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years}

Thus, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13
polymath-low-en-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. After selling to the red house, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners to the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   We know that after selling to the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Next, we isolate \( \frac{2x}{3} \) by adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12

First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Then, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which is the remaining number of students after those enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

Let's denote the future value of the jewelry purchase as \( V_{\text{jewelry}} \) and the future value of the electronic gadgets purchase as \( V_{\text{gadgets}} \).

The future value of the jewelry purchase after a 2.5% increase is:
\[ V_{\text{jewelry}} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \]

The future value of the electronic gadgets purchase after a 1.2% increase is:
\[ V_{\text{gadgets}} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \]

The profit from the jewelry purchase is the difference between the future value and the original purchase price:
\[ \text{Profit}_{\text{jewelry}} = V_{\text{jewelry}} - 5000 = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

The profit from the electronic gadgets purchase is the difference between the future value and the original purchase price:
\[ \text{Profit}_{\text{gadgets}} = V_{\text{gadgets}} - 8000 = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the two profits, the profit from the jewelry purchase is higher. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry purchase plan to maximize profit.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour for teaching.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.

Earnings from teaching = Hours per week * Hourly rate * Weeks per year
Earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year
Earnings from teaching = $3500/week * 50 weeks/year
Earnings from teaching = $175,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a cheerleading coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour for coaching.
- There are 50 weeks in a year.

Earnings from coaching = Hours per week * Hourly rate * Weeks per year
Earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year
Earnings from coaching = $450/week * 50 weeks/year
Earnings from coaching = $22,500/year

Finally, let's add her earnings from both positions to find her total annual salary:
Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
Total annual salary = $175,000 + $22,500
Total annual salary = $197,500

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Determine the number of eggs she eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.**
Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. Therefore, she eats 3 eggs each day.

**Step 2: Determine the number of eggs she eats in one week.**
There are 7 days in a week. So, the number of eggs she eats in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.**
Since she eats 21 eggs each week, in 4 weeks she will eat:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.**
There are 12 eggs in a dozen. Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking.
2. Determine the remaining distance she needs to walk.
3. Use the desired average speed to find the required time for the remaining distance.
4. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent so far is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine the remaining distance she needs to walk. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find the required time for the remaining 6 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
So, the required time for the remaining 6 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find the required speed for the remaining distance. The required speed is the distance divided by the time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:

2. Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.
3. Determine the amount of orange drink that remains after one liter is spilled.
4. Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink.

First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we need to determine the amount of orange drink that remains after one liter is spilled. Since 1 liter of orange drink is spilled, the amount of orange drink that remains is:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink is the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the water in the pineapple drink:
