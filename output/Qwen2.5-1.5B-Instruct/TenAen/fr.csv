Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on blue ties which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?

Now, let's break down the information given:

1. Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
2. The cost of red ties is 50% more than the cost of blue ties.
3. He spent $200 on blue ties, which cost $40 each.

Let's denote:
- The number of blue ties as \( B \).
- The cost of one blue tie as \( C_b = 40 \) dollars.
- The cost of one red tie as \( C_r = 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \) dollars (since they cost 50% more).

From the information given, we know:
- \( B \) blue ties cost \( 200 \) dollars.
- \( B \) blue ties cost \( 200 \) dollars.

So, \( B = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \) blue ties.

Since Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) red ties.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the ties:
- Cost of blue ties: \( 5 \times 40 = 200 \) dollars.
- Cost of red ties: \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is \( 200 + 600 = 800 \) dollars.

So, the answer is \( \boxed{800} \).",800,800
mgsm-fr-48,"English translation: Tracy, to support her tomato plants in her garden, used a 4-foot long wire. This wire was cut into several pieces of 6 inches each. How many pieces did she get?

To solve this, we first convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet is equal to 48 inches.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she got:

$$
\text{Number of pieces} = \frac{\text{Total length of wire}}{\text{Length of each piece}} = \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",8,8
mgsm-fr-49,"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments, the total number of apartments is:

\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many apartments are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

To find the number of unoccupied apartments, we subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the number of unoccupied apartments in the building is $30$.",30,30
mgsm-fr-50,"English translation: Lloyd owns a poultry farm. His hens produce 252 eggs per day and they sell them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd earn per week from his eggs?

To calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs sold per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings.
3. Find the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Number of eggs sold per day
Lloyd's hens produce 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings
The eggs are sold for $2 per dozen. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the daily earnings as follows:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Find the weekly earnings
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily earnings by 7:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earns $294 per week from his eggs.",294,294

Tom's boat moves at 10 miles per hour. It travels from 13:00 to 16:00, then returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour. How long will it take for the boat to return?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey:**
   - The boat travels from 13:00 to 16:00, which is a duration of 3 hours.
   - The speed of the boat is 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Calculate the time taken for the return journey:**
   - The boat returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour.
   - The distance to be covered is 30 miles.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

3. **Calculate the total time taken for the round trip:**
   - The first part of the journey took 3 hours.
   - The return journey took 5 hours.
   - Total time = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

""The bag of Uriah becomes too heavy for him. He needs to reduce his weight by 15 pounds. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and each toy 1/2 pound. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?""

To answer this, let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the total weight reduction from comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
   - Removing 30 comic books means:
     \[
     30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining weight after removing comic books:**
   - The initial weight of the bag is not specified, but we know it needs to be reduced by 15 pounds.
   - After removing 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight is:
     \[
     15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of toys to remove:**
   - Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
   - To find out how many toys need to be removed to bring the weight back to 15 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:
     \[
     \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
     \]

So, the final answer is $15$ toys.",15,15
mgsm-fr-53,"First, let's translate the question into English:

A mechanic charges different repair prices for truck tires and car tires. For each truck tire repaired, he charges $60, and for each car tire, he charges $40. On Thursday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, he repaired 12 car tires and none of the truck tires. Which day had the highest earnings, and how much more did the mechanic earn on that day compared to the other day?

Next, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total earnings: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60/tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total earnings: $0 + $480 = $480

Comparing the earnings:
- Thursday: $520
- Friday: $480

The day with the highest earnings was Thursday, with a difference of $520 - $480 = $40 more than Friday.

Therefore, the answer is $40.",40,40
mgsm-fr-54,"English translation: The Doubtfire sisters leave the local animal shelter with 7 adopted kittens in their car. On their way home, they receive a call from their mother who informs them that their two domestic cats have given birth to kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, had three times the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other, had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family have now?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of kittens born to both Patchy and Trixie.

1. Patchy had 3 times the number of adopted kittens as the 7 adopted kittens, so Patchy had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.
2. Trixie had 12 kittens.

Adding these together gives the total number of kittens:

The truck is filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds. The empty weight of the driver and the truck is 3755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge?

To find the answer, we need to determine the total weight limit of the bridge and then subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck. After that, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box to find out how many boxes can be loaded.

1. Calculate the total weight limit of the bridge:
\[ \text{Total weight limit} = 5000 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck:
\[ \text{Weight of driver and empty truck} = 3755 \text{ pounds} \]

3. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:
\[ \text{Remaining weight capacity} = \text{Total weight limit} - \text{Weight of driver and empty truck} \]
\[ \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

4. Calculate the number of boxes that can be loaded:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Remaining weight capacity}}{\text{Weight of one box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \]

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sara, and Sara does four times as much laundry as David. Given that Sara does 400 loads of laundry, calculate the difference between the amount of laundry that Raymond does and that which David does.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how much laundry Sara does:**
   Sara does 400 loads of laundry.

2. **Determine how much laundry David does:**
   Since Sara does four times as much laundry as David, we can calculate David's laundry load as follows:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sara's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ loads}
   \]

3. **Determine how much laundry Raymond does:**
   Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sara, we can calculate Raymond's laundry load as follows:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sara's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ loads}
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference between the amount of laundry that Raymond does and that which David does:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ loads}

1. **Identify the cost per bouquet for each option:**
   - For the bouquet of 3 flowers for $2.50:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bouquet} = \frac{2.50}{3} = \frac{2.50}{3} \approx 0.8333 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the bouquet of 2 flowers for $1.00:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bouquet} = \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the best option for 18 flowers:**
   - If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the cost of 0.50 dollars per bouquet:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 18 \times 0.50 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the cost of 0.8333 dollars per bouquet:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 18 \times 0.8333 \approx 15.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost at the cheaper option - Total cost at the more expensive option
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 9.00 - 15.00 = -6.00 \text{ dollars}

A football team played 22 games. It won $x$ times as many games as it lost. How many times did it win?

To answer this, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of games lost as $y$. Since the team won $x$ times as many games as it lost, the number of games won would be $x \cdot y$. The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x \cdot y + y = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won $x$ times as many games as it lost, so we can express this as:
\[ x = x \cdot y \]

Now, we need to solve this system of equations. First, let's solve the second equation for $y$:
\[ x = x \cdot y \]
\[ y = 1 \]

Now that we know $y = 1$, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find $x$:
\[ x \cdot 1 + 1 = 22 \]
\[ x + 1 = 22 \]
\[ x = 21 \]

   - Let \( J \) be the age of Jackson.
   - Let \( A \) be the age of Amy.
   - Let \( C \) be the age of Corey.
   - Let \( Q \) be the age of Jacques.

2. From the problem, we know:

   - \( Q = C - 1 \) (Jacques is 1 year younger than Corey)

4. According to the problem, there are two times more worker bees than queen bees, so \( W = 2Q \).
5. There are two times more queen bees than drone bees, so \( Q = 2D \).
6. The total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, queen bees, and drone bees, so \( B = W + Q + D \).
7. Substituting the expressions for \( W \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( D \), we get \( 700 = 2(2D) + 2D + D \).

Jean has 10 hectares of banana plantation. Each hectare has 100 bananas, so the total number of bananas per hectare is 100. Therefore, the total number of bananas in the plantation is 10 hectares * 100 bananas/hectare = 1000 bananas/hectare.

Jean harvests all the bananas every 3 months. In a year, there are 4 quarters, so Jean can harvest bananas 4 times in a year. Therefore, the total number of bananas Jean can harvest in a year is 1000 bananas/hectare * 4 harvests/year = 4000 bananas/year.

Therefore, the answer is 4000.",4000,4000

To find the total number of pieces Johnny gathered, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each Lego set and then sum them up.

1. The first Lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second Lego set has 3 times as many pieces as the first one, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third Lego set has 1/4 of the number of pieces in the first set, so it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add the pieces from all three Lego sets:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

Therefore, Johnny gathered a total of \(2125\) pieces.",2125,

Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees enter and exit in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, then half of those return in the next 6 hours. Then, during the next 6 hours, she sees twice as many bees leave the hive as those that left the first time. Finally, during the next 6 hours, all the bees that were out and hadn't returned yet return to the hive. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day?

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of those 30 bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave the hive as those that left the first time, which is 30 * 2 = 60 bees.
4. During the next 6 hours, all the bees that were out and hadn't returned yet return to the hive. Since 30 bees left the first time and 15 bees returned in the second time, a total of 30 + 15 = 45 bees were out and hadn't returned yet. Therefore, all 45 of those bees return to the hive.

So, the total number of bees that returned to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day is 45.

If Tim moves by skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?

Answer: To determine who will arrive first, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to reach the school.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles
- Speed: 440 feet per minute

Dave bought a large bag of fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hands. When the seagull landed, it ate half the quantity of fries that Dave had eaten. Then, three pigeons forced the seagull to leave the food and each of them could eat three fries. Later, a rat caught two-thirds of the remaining fries. The ants took the last one, leaving five fries. How many fries were in the bag when Dave bought it?

Let's denote the total number of fries in the bag as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so \( x - 14 \) fries were left.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries, leaving \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons ate three fries each, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries were eaten, leaving \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries.
4. The rat ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) \), leaving \( (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries.

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends on his classes in a semester. We can break this down into two parts:

1. Calculate the total hours spent on classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
2. Calculate the total hours spent on classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
3. Add the two totals together to get the final answer.

For Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- There are 3 days in a week.
- There are 16 weeks in a semester.
- Kimo has 3 classes per day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.

Total hours for these days = 3 days/week * 16 weeks * 3 classes/day * 1 hour/class

For Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- There are 2 days in a week.
- There are 16 weeks in a semester.
- Kimo has 2 classes per day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.

- Each small bread measures 4 inches.
- Therefore, the total length of the small breads is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the croissants:
- Bill makes 120 croissants.
- Each croissant measures 6 inches.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:

Now, we sum the lengths of all the products:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\]

So, the total length of all the products when they are placed end-to-end is 3360 inches. Converting this to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase over 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

The price increase every two months can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Price increase} = \text{Initial price} \times \text{Increase percentage} \]
\[ \text{Price increase} = \$20 \times 0.20 = \$4 \]

Since the price increases every two months, we need to calculate how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \text{Number of two-month periods in 36 months} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Now, we can calculate the total price increase over 36 months:
\[ \text{Total price increase} = \text{Price increase per two-month period} \times \text{Number of two-month periods} \]
\[ \text{Total price increase} = \$4 \times 18 = \$72 \]

Finally, we add this total price increase to the initial price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final price} = \text{Initial price} + \text{Total price increase} \]
\[ \text{Final price} = \$20 + \$72 = \$92 \]

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They make 20 glasses of lemonade and sell each glass for $0.50. If they have made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Now, let's answer the question in English:

Let's denote the number of gallons of lemonade they sold as \( x \).

The cost of lemons for \( x \) gallons is \( 3x \) dollars.
The cost of sugar for \( x \) gallons is \( 2x \) dollars.

The total cost for \( x \) gallons is \( 3x + 2x = 5x \) dollars.

They sell each glass for $0.50, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) glasses is \( 0.50x \) dollars.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $25. So we have:
\[ 0.50x - 5x = 25 \]
\[ -4.50x = 25 \]
\[ x = \frac{25}{-4.50} \]
\[ x = -\frac{25}{4.5} \]
\[ x = -\frac{250}{45} \]
\[ x = -\frac{50}{9} \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of gallons sold, it must be a positive value. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that they sold \( x \) gallons, and the profit equation should be:
\[ 0.50x - 5x = 25 \]
\[ -4.50x = 25 \]
\[ x = \frac{25}{-4.50} \]
\[ x = -\frac{25}{4.5} \]
\[ x = -\frac{50}{9} \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of gallons sold, it must be a positive value. Therefore, the correct interpretation should be that they sold \( x \) gallons, and the profit equation should be:
\[ 0.50x - 5x = 25 \]
\[ -4.50x = 25 \]
\[ x = \frac{25}{-4.50} \]
\[ x = -\frac{25}{4.5} \]
\[ x = -\frac{50}{9} \]

The correct answer is \( \boxed{5} \).",5,15

Jean is two years older than Marc. Two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. If Jan is 30 years old, what is Jean's age?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Jean's current age as \( J \), Marc's current age as \( M \), and Jan's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Jean is two years older than Marc, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
3. Two years ago, Marc's age was \( M - 2 \) and Jan's age was \( A - 2 \). The problem states that two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(A - 2) + 5
   \]
4. We know that Jan is 30 years old, so \( A = 30 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(30 - 2) + 5
   \]
   Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5

   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5

   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   M = 21

5. Now that we know Marc's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:
   \[
   J = M + 2

   \[
   J = 21 + 2

One of the two teams is very well-coordinated, with each of its members running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less well-coordinated. Its first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, how many seconds will the fastest team win?

To determine how many seconds the fastest team will win, we need to calculate the total time for each team to complete the race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the fastest team:
- Each of the four members runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for the fastest team is \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 400 meters in 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 400 meters in 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 400 meters in 51 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for the slower team is \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Since the fastest team has a total time of 220 seconds and the slower team has a total time of 222 seconds, the fastest team will win in 220 seconds.

To answer the question, we need to calculate the probability of obtaining a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die and then subtract the probability of obtaining a number greater than 3 and a number greater than 3 again.

The probability of obtaining a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is:
$$
\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
$$
The probability of obtaining a number greater than 3 and a number greater than 3 again is:
$$
\left(\frac{4}{6}\right) \times \left(\frac{4}{6}\right) = \frac{16}{36} = \frac{4}{9}

Therefore, the probability of obtaining a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, but not obtaining a number greater than 3 and a number greater than 3 again, is:
$$
\frac{2}{3} - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{6}{9} - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{2}{9}

So, Jenna picked:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with one rat and receiving 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit pen where 20 pieces of straw are distributed. No straw is used elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed to small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of rats in the hamster cages:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster cage has 1 rat.
   - Therefore, the total number of rats in the hamster cages is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cages} \times 1 \text{ rat per cage} = 10 \text{ rats}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of rats in the rabbit pen:**
   - There is 1 rabbit pen.
   - The rabbit pen distributes 20 pieces of straw.
   - Each rat in the rabbit pen receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the number of rats in the rabbit pen is:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ pieces of straw}}{5 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 4 \text{ rats}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of rats:**
   - The total number of rats is the sum of the rats in the hamster cages and the rats in the rabbit pen:
     \[
     10 \text{ rats} + 4 \text{ rats} = 14 \text{ rats}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**
   - There are 160 pieces of straw distributed to small rodents.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the number of rats per cage is:
     \[
     \frac{160 \text{ pieces of straw}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = \frac{160}{6} \approx 26.67 \text{ rats per cage}
     \]
   - Since the number of rats per cage must be a whole number, we need to consider the context of the problem. The problem states that each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, and the total number of rats is 14. Therefore, the number of rats per cage must be a whole number that fits the distribution.

mgsm-fr-187,"English translation: Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to a monthly interest rate of 2%. If Mandy can pay this amount at the end of 3 months, what amount should she give to Benedict?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months, including the interest.

1. **Initial Amount**: Mandy owes Benedict $100.
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% per month.

The formula to calculate the total amount after a certain period with compound interest is:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

Since the interest is compounded monthly, \( n = 12 \) and \( t = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ A = 100 \left(1 + \frac{0.02}{12}\right)^{12 \times 0.25} \]

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the monthly interest rate:
\[ \frac{0.02}{12} = 0.00166667 \]

2. Calculate the total number of compounding periods:
\[ 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \]

3. Substitute these values back into the formula:
\[ A = 100 \left(1 + 0.00166667\right)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \left(1.00166667\right)^3 \]

4. Calculate \( 1.00166667^3 \):
\[ 1.00166667^3 \approx 1.00500000 \]

5. Multiply by the principal amount:
\[ A = 100 \times 1.00500000 \]
\[ A \approx 100.50 \]

   R = 60 - 12
   R = 48
5) Now, we know there are 60 dogs and 48 rabbits. The total number of pets (D + C + R) is:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we divide the hours by 0.5 (since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours) to find the number of episodes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 4 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, Frankie watched 4 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.",30,3

Henri is preparing cookies for a local pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. At the end of the baking, he finds that he made 15 more cookies than he had planned. He drops 5 of his cookies while they are cooling and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri make last year?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henri planned to make last year.
2. According to the problem, he wants to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he plans to make \( 2x \) cookies this year.
3. At the end of the baking, he finds that he made 15 more cookies than planned, so he actually made \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He drops 5 cookies while they are cooling, so he has \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left.
5. We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110 \\
   2x = 110 - 10 \\
   2x = 100 \\
   x = \frac{100}{2} \\
   x = 50
   \]

Therefore, Henri made $50$ cookies last year.",50,50

A gas station sells gasoline for $3.00 per gallon. A fuel application company offers a $0.20 refund per gallon if you fill up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, what will be the purchase price after the refunds?

To calculate the final price after the refunds, we need to subtract the total refund amount from the total purchase price.

Total purchase price = 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00
Total refund amount = 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00

Final price = Total purchase price - Total refund amount
Final price = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

A leak occurred on Julia's boat while she was on the lake. The boat started taking two liters of water every ten feet in the direction of the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to cover twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, how much water had the boat taken when Julia reached the shore?

To answer this, we need to calculate the speed of the boat in feet per second and then determine how much water it took in over the 64 seconds it took to reach the shore.

First, we calculate the speed of the boat:
- The boat covers 20 feet in 16 seconds, so its speed is $20 \text{ feet} / 16 \text{ seconds} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}$.

Next, we calculate the total distance the boat traveled in 64 seconds:
- The boat travels $1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}$.

Since the boat took 20 feet to take in 2 liters of water, we can calculate the amount of water it took in over 80 feet:
- The boat takes in $2 \text{ liters} / 20 \text{ feet} = 0.1 \text{ liters/foot}$.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of water the boat took in over 80 feet:
- The boat took in $0.1 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ liters}$.

Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. Brittany's phone can store at most 50 times more photos than the number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal, where the photo shows ducks in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo he took?

To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store.
2. Calculate the number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal.
3. Find out how many ducks can be seen in the photo.

Step 1: Determine the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store.
Since Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos and it can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, we can calculate the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store as follows:
\[ \text{Maximum photos Brittany's phone can store} = \frac{\text{Jamal's phone capacity}}{6} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal.
The photo shows ducks in the zoo, and we know that the number of birds in the photo is 50 times the number of ducks. Let \( D \) represent the number of ducks. Then:
\[ D = 50 \times \text{number of ducks} \]

Step 3: Find out how many ducks can be seen in the photo.
Since the number of birds in the photo is 300 (as calculated in Step 1), we can find the number of ducks by dividing the number of birds by 50:
\[ \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 5x = 30 - 10 \]

If the salaries of Adrien and Lylah have increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.

Let's denote:
- Adrien's salary four years ago as \( A_0 = 40,000 \) dollars.
- Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L_0 \) dollars.

According to the problem, Adrien's salary four years later was 40% higher than his initial salary:
\[ A_4 = A_0 + 0.40 \cdot A_0 = 1.40 \cdot A_0 = 1.40 \cdot 40,000 = 56,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary had also increased by 40%, making it 40% higher than her initial salary:
\[ L_4 = L_0 + 0.40 \cdot L_0 = 1.40 \cdot L_0 \]

Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume that their salaries increased by the same percentage. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ L_4 = 1.40 \cdot L_0 \]

We know that \( L_4 = 56,000 \) dollars, so:
\[ 56,000 = 1.40 \cdot L_0 \]

Solving for \( L_0 \):
\[ L_0 = \frac{56,000}{1.40} = 40,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of their salaries four years later:
\[ A_4 + L_4 = 56,000 + 56,000 = 112,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jennie helps her mother's office. She has a pile of 60 letters to stamp and another pile with already stamped letters. She stamps one third of the letters to stamp. There are now 30 letters in the pile of stamped letters. How many letters were in this pile when Jennie started the work?

To solve this, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped initially. Let's denote the number of letters she stamped initially as $x$. Since she stamped one third of the letters to stamp, the number of letters she stamped is $\frac{1}{3}x$. Therefore, the number of letters she still had to stamp is $60 - \frac{1}{3}x$. After stamping, she has 30 letters in the pile of stamped letters. This means that the number of letters she still had to stamp is equal to the number of letters she stamped plus the 30 letters she has now. So we can set up the equation:

\[60 - \frac{1}{3}x = 30 + \frac{1}{3}x\]

Now, let's solve this equation for $x$:

\[
\begin{align*}
60 - \frac{1}{3}x &= 30 + \frac{1}{3}x \\
60 - 30 &= \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}x \\
30 &= \frac{2}{3}x \\
x &= \frac{30}{\frac{2}{3}} \\
x &= 30 \times \frac{3}{2} \\

Dillon is sent to the market to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much does he spend if each pepper costs $15?

Now, let's answer the question in English:

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as \( P \). According to the problem, \( P = 15 \) dollars.

The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of a pepper, so the cost of a watermelon is \( 3P \).

The cost of an orange is 5 times less than the cost of a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is \( \frac{3P}{5} \).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

1. Cost of watermelons: \( 4 \times 3P = 4 \times 3 \times 15 = 180 \) dollars.
2. Cost of peppers: \( 20 \times P = 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.
3. Cost of oranges: \( 10 \times \frac{3P}{5} = 10 \times \frac{3 \times 15}{5} = 10 \times 9 = 90 \) dollars.

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
2. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.

There are only 27 unicorns left in the world. One third of them are located in the Highlands, Scotland. Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are women. How many Scottish unicorns are there?

Answer: Let's denote the total number of unicorns as U. According to the problem, we have:

1. \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the unicorns are in the Highlands, Scotland. So, \( \frac{1}{3}U \) unicorns are in the Highlands.
2. \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the unicorns are Scottish. So, \( \frac{2}{3}U \) unicorns are Scottish.

Since the total number of Scottish unicorns is given as 27, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3}U = 27 \]

To find \( U \), we solve for \( U \):

\[ U = 27 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ U = 27 \times 1.5 \]
\[ U = 40.5 \]

Since the number of unicorns must be a whole number, and we cannot have half a unicorn, we need to round to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's clear that the number of unicorns should be a whole number, so we should re-evaluate the problem statement and the context.

Now, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. **Determine the cost per yogurt:**
   - Terry sells 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per yogurt is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per yogurt} = \frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \text{ dollars}

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Jean makes from selling his Lego sets:

First, let's denote the speed at which Dana walks as \( w \) miles per hour. According to the problem, Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so her running speed is \( 4w \) miles per hour.

Next, we know that Dana's walking speed \( w \) is related to her running speed \( 4w \) by the given information that she saunts two times less fast than she runs. This means that the time she spends walking is two times the time she spends running. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent walking is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of six hours, and the time spent running is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of six hours.

The time spent walking is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours, and the time spent running is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana covers during each activity. The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance while walking} = w \times 4 = 4w \text{ miles} \]

The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance while running} = 4w \times 2 = 8w \text{ miles} \]

The total distance covered in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while walking and while running:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 4w + 8w = 12w \text{ miles} \]

We are also given that Dana's walking speed \( w \) is 3 miles per hour. Therefore, we can substitute \( w = 3 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana covers in six hours is \( \boxed{36} \) miles.",36,18

To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of calories in a 300 g bag of chips.
2. Calculate how many calories are left to reach the daily goal.
3. Determine how many portions of chips can be eaten with the remaining calories.
4. Calculate the total grams of chips eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the number of calories in a 300 g bag of chips.
Since 300 g contains 5 portions, and each portion contains 250 calories, the total calories in 300 g are:
\[ 300 \text{ g} \times \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ g}} = 250 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Calculate how many calories are left to reach the daily goal.
The daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories are:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: Determine how many portions of chips can be eaten with the remaining calories.
Since each portion contains 250 calories, the number of portions that can be eaten with 200 calories is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/portion}} = 0.8 \text{ portions} \]
Since you can't eat a fraction of a portion, you can eat 0 full portions and 0.8 of another portion.

Step 4: Calculate the total grams of chips eaten.
Since each portion is 300 g, 0 full portions are 0 grams, and 0.8 of another portion is:

Let's calculate:

80 (initial thinking caps) - 220 (used thinking caps) + 23 (remaining thinking caps) = 80 - 220 + 23 = -137 + 23 = -114 + 23 = -91 + 23 = -68 + 23 = -45 + 23 = -22 + 23 = 1

So, the number of thinking caps in the packet Candice bought is 1.

Jean buys twice as many red neckties as blue neckties. The red neckties cost 50% more. He spent $20 on blue neckties, each costing $40. How much did he spend on neckties?

Now, let's answer the question in English:

Let's denote the number of blue neckties Jean buys as \( x \). Since he buys twice as many red neckties as blue neckties, he buys \( 2x \) red neckties.

The cost of each blue necktie is $40, so the total cost for blue neckties is \( 40x \).

The cost of each red necktie is 50% more than the cost of a blue necktie. Therefore, the cost of each red necktie is \( 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 60 \) dollars.

The total cost for red neckties is \( 60 \times 2x = 120x \).

The total amount spent on neckties is the sum of the cost of blue neckties and the cost of red neckties:
\[ 40x + 120x = 160x \]

We know that the total amount spent on blue neckties is $200, so:
\[ 40x = 200 \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Now we can calculate the total amount spent on neckties:
\[ 160x = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Therefore, Jean spent $800 on neckties.",800,800

A mechanic charges different repair prices for truck tires and car tires. For each truck tire repaired, he charges $60, and for each car tire, he charges $40. On Thursday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, he repaired 12 car tires and none of the truck tires. On which day did the mechanic earn the most money, and how much more did he earn compared to the other day?

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires × $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires × $40/tire = $160
- Total earnings: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40/tire = $480
- Truck tires: 0 tires × $60/tire = $0
- Total earnings: $480 + $0 = $480

Comparing the earnings:
- Thursday: $520
- Friday: $480

The mechanic earned the most money on Thursday, earning $520 - $480 = $40 more than Friday.

A delivery truck is about to cross a wooden bridge that can only support a weight of no more than 5,000 pounds. The truck is fully loaded with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds. The empty weight of the driver and the truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total weight of the truck and the boxes, and then determine how many boxes can be safely loaded without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

1. Calculate the total weight of the truck and the boxes:
   - Empty weight of the truck and driver: 3,755 pounds
   - Weight of one box: 15 pounds
   - Number of boxes: 5,000 pounds / 15 pounds per box = 333.33 boxes

Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we can only load 333 boxes.

2. Calculate the total weight of the truck and the boxes with 333 boxes:
   - Total weight: 3,755 pounds (empty weight) + 333 boxes * 15 pounds per box = 3,755 pounds + 4,995 pounds = 8,750 pounds

The total weight of the truck and the boxes with 333 boxes is 8,750 pounds, which exceeds the bridge's weight limit of 5,000 pounds.

Therefore, the number of boxes that can be safely loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is $333$.",333,83

A treasure hunter unearthed a chest filled with precious stones. It contained 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than the number of diamonds, and twice as many emeralds as rubies. How many precious stones were in the chest?

To solve this, let's define the variables:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of diamonds.
- Let \( R \) represent the number of rubies.
- Let \( E \) represent the number of emeralds.

1. We know that the château has 4 levels.
2. The largest level has an area of 16 square feet.
3. Each level has half the area of the level below it.

Let's denote the areas of the levels as follows:
- Level 1: \( A_1 \)
- Level 2: \( A_2 \)
- Level 3: \( A_3 \)
- Level 4: \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet (largest level)

Since each level has half the area of the level below it:
- \( A_2 = \frac{1}{2} A_1 \)
- \( A_3 = \frac{1}{2} A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} A_1 \right) = \frac{1}{4} A_1 \)
- \( A_4 = \frac{1}{2} A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4} A_1 \right) = \frac{1}{8} A_1 \)

Given that \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet:
\[ \frac{1}{8} A_1 = 16 \]
\[ A_1 = 16 \times 8 \]
\[ A_1 = 128 \] square feet

Now, we can find the areas of the other levels:
- \( A_2 = \frac{1}{2} A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 128 = 64 \) square feet
- \( A_3 = \frac{1}{4} A_1 = \frac{1}{4} \times 128 = 32 \) square feet

Finally, we calculate the average area of a level:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} \]

Let's denote the number of matches won by the team as \( W \) and the number of matches lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won _ times more than it lost, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = L + _ \]

We also know that the total number of matches played is 22, so:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

\[ (L + _) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[ 2L + _ = 22 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine the value of _. Since the team won _ times more than it lost, _ must be a positive integer. Let's test possible values for _:

""Previously, Lee ran the hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gérald. But after a dietary change, Gérald improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the hurdles in 38 seconds, what is, in seconds, Gérald's race time after his new diet?""

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote Lee's initial time as \( T_L \) and Gérald's initial time as \( T_G \).
2. According to the information given, \( T_L = T_G + 2 \) seconds.
3. After the dietary change, Gérald's speed improves by 10%, so his new time \( T_G' \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   T_G' = \frac{T_G}{1.1}
   \]
4. We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so:
   \[
   T_L = 38 \text{ seconds}
   \]
5. Substituting \( T_L \) into the equation \( T_L = T_G + 2 \):
   \[
   38 = T_G + 2
   \]
   Solving for \( T_G \):
   \[
   T_G = 38 - 2 = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]
6. Now, we can find Gérald's new time \( T_G' \):
   \[
   T_G' = \frac{T_G}{1.1} = \frac{36}{1.1} \approx 32.73 \text{ seconds}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. We know that each can of 16 ounces contains 3 tomatoes, and each tomato loses half its volume when cooked.

First, let's find out how many tomatoes are in 32 ounces of sauce. Since each can of 16 ounces contains 3 tomatoes, we can calculate the number of tomatoes in 32 ounces as follows:

1. Determine the number of cans needed to get 32 ounces of sauce:

   \]

2. **New plant pots received**: Marie received 18 new plant pots from her favorite nursery. Adding these to the initial number of plant pots:

1. Let's denote the number of times the first friend rang the bell as \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the second friend rang the bell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend, so the second friend rang the bell \( x + \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{5}{4}x \).
3. The third friend rang the bell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend rang the bell \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) times.

Henri is preparing cookies for a local pastry contest. He wants to make twice as many cookies as last year. At the end of the baking, he notices that he made 15 more cookies than he planned. He drops 5 of his cookies while they are cooling and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri make last year?

Now, let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henri made last year as \( x \).
2. According to the problem, Henri wants to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he plans to make \( 2x \) cookies.
3. At the end of baking, he notices that he made 15 more cookies than planned, so he actually made \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He drops 5 cookies while they are cooling, so he ends up with \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies.
5. We know that he ends up with a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110 \\
   2x = 110 - 10 \\

If each of them eats all their shortbread, how many on average did they eat?

**Answer:**
Let's denote the number of shortbread squares Marcell eats as \( M_s \) and the number of long shortbread squares as \( M_l \). Similarly, let the number of shortbread squares Béatrice eats be \( B_s \) and the number of long shortbread squares be \( B_l \).

If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo he took?

Now, let's break down the information:

1. Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos.
2. Brittany's phone can store at most 50 times more photos than Jamal's phone.
3. Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone.

Now, we know that Brittany's phone can store at most 50 times more photos than the number of birds on the photo taken by Jamal. Since Jamal's photo shows ducks, we can assume that the number of birds is the same as the number of ducks.

\[ \text{Number of birds} = \frac{\text{Brittany's phone capacity}}{50} = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \text{ birds} \]

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. She slept 2 hours less each of the two following days due to some obligations. Given that she slept 1 hour more than during these two days for the rest of the week, how many hours did she sleep in total during the entire week?

Let's denote the number of hours Sadie slept on Tuesday and Wednesday as \( x \). According to the problem, she slept \( x - 2 \) hours on each of these days due to her obligations.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \( x + 1 \) hours each day.

The total number of hours she slept during the week can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 8 + (x - 2) + (x - 2) + (x + 1) + (x + 1) + (x + 1) + (x + 1)
\]
Simplifying the expression:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 8 + 3x - 6 + 3x + 3 + 3x + 3 + 3x + 3 + 3x + 3
\]
\[
\text{Total hours} = 8 + 3x + 3x + 3x + 3x + 3x + 3x - 6 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3
\]
\[
\text{Total hours} = 8 + 18x - 6 + 15
\]
\[
\text{Total hours} = 8 + 18x + 9
\]
\[
\text{Total hours} = 17 + 18x
\]

Since the problem does not provide the specific value of \( x \), we cannot determine the exact number of hours Sadie slept in the entire week. However, if we assume \( x = 10 \) (a reasonable assumption based on the problem's context), we can calculate the total hours as follows:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 17 + 18 \times 10 = 17 + 180 = 197
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Sadie slept during the entire week is \( \boxed{197} \).",197,48

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Rosie runs in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First segment:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second segment:**
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours (since she has already run for 3 hours)
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Total distance:**
   - Distance from the first segment: 30 miles
   - Distance from the second segment: 20 miles
   - Total distance: \( 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles} \)

Jennie helps her mother at the post office. She has a pile of 60 letters to stamp and another pile with already stamped letters. She stamps one third of the letters to stamp. There are now 30 letters in the pile of stamped letters. How many letters were in this pile when Jennie started her work?

To solve this, let's denote the number of letters in the pile when Jennie started her work as \( x \).

1. Jennie stamps one third of the 60 letters to stamp:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ letters}
   \]
   So, after stamping, she has \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) letters left to stamp.

2. She then stamps one third of the remaining 40 letters to stamp:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 40 = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \text{ letters}
   \]
   Since the number of stamps must be a whole number, we round down to 13 stamps (as she can't stamp a fraction of a letter).

3. After stamping 13 letters, the number of letters left to stamp is:
   \[
   40 - 13 = 27 \text{ letters}
   \]

4. She then stamps one third of the remaining 27 letters to stamp:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \text{ letters}
   \]
   So, after stamping, she has \( 27 - 9 = 18 \) letters left to stamp.

5. After stamping 9 letters, the number of letters left to stamp is:
   \[
   27 - 9 = 18 \text{ letters}
   \]

6. She then stamps one third of the remaining 18 letters to stamp:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \text{ letters}

12. She then stamps one third of the remaining 6 letters to stamp:
    \[

The total cost of the sacks is \( 20x \) dollars.

The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost:

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 18x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{400}{18} = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22 \]

Now, let's break down the costs:

1. **Tickets to the fair:** $20.25
2. **Food:** $20.25 - $0.45 = $19.80
3. **Merry-go-rounds:** 2 * $33 = $66

Tom plants 10 trees per year. He also cuts down 2 trees each year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?

To solve this, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years and then subtract that from the initial number of trees.

1. Calculate the net change in the number of trees per year:

To find the answer, we need to calculate the total earnings for each publisher and then find the difference.

1. **Publisher A:**
   - Marc edits 1000 sentences per week.

3. Find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to reach this total sum.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the scores needed for a mean of 93 over six tests. The formula for the mean is:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Scores}}{\text{Number of Tests}} \]
So, for a mean of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. We subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ 558 - 448 = 110 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score $110$ on the sixth test to achieve a mean of 93.

The answer is $\boxed{110}$.",110,98

1. Joe's Halloween candy bag contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 caramel-coated candies.
2. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a caramel-coated candy.
3. Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

Let's calculate the weight of the caramel-coated candies first:
- Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each caramel-coated candy weighs half of that, each caramel-coated candy weighs \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) grams.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the caramel-coated candies:
- There are 80 caramel-coated candies, so their total weight is \( 80 \times 20 = 1600 \) grams.

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
- There are 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40 grams, so their total weight is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \) grams.

Finally, let's add the weight of the caramel-coated candies and the chocolate bars to get the total weight of the candy bag:
- The total weight is \( 1600 + 1000 = 2600 \) grams.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{2600} \) grams.",2600,2600

So, the equation is:
\[ 240x = 72 \times 6000 - 1200 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 240x = 432000 - 1200 \]
\[ 240x = 430800 \]

mgsm-fr-210,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Sara wants to buy a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she chose costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysits for her neighbor 4 times a week and earns $5 each time. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah had $10 in savings before starting to babysit, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to be able to afford the jacket and shoes?

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
- Jacket: $30
- 2 pairs of shoes: 2 * $20 = $40
- Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Next, let's calculate Sara's total earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Earnings from babysitting: 4 times * $5 = $20
- Earnings from mowing the lawn: 4 times * $4 = $16
- Total earnings: $20 + $16 = $36

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara needs to save:
- Total cost: $70
- Total earnings: $36
- Amount needed: $70 - $36 = $34

Finally, let's calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn $34:
- Amount needed: $34
- Earnings per mowing: $4
- Number of mowings needed: $34 / $4 = 8.5

Since Sara can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, she needs to mow the lawn 9 times to be able to afford the jacket and shoes.

mgsm-fr-214,"The question is already in English. Let's break down the problem:

1. Jerry has two pools, both with leaks that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
2. There are 4 minutes between the initial and current states.
3. At the initial state (4 minutes ago), the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
4. Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote:
- The initial amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons.
- The initial amount of water in the large pool as \( L \) gallons.

From the problem, we know:
- The large pool had twice as much water as the small pool at the initial state: \( L = 2S \).
- The large pool now has four times as much water as the small pool: \( L = 4S \).

Since the large pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in the large pool after 4 minutes is:
\[ L - 4 \times 4 = L - 16 \]

Since the small pool is leaking at the same rate, the amount of water in the small pool after 4 minutes is:
\[ S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \]

Given that \( L = 4S \), we can substitute \( L \) in the equation for the large pool:
\[ 4S - 16 = 4S - 16 \]

This confirms that the amount of water in the large pool after 4 minutes is indeed \( 4S - 16 \).

Now, we need to find the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ S - 16 \]

Since the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool after 4 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

\[ 4S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ -16 = -64 \]

To find out how much money Janeth will have left, we need to calculate the total amount she will repay and then subtract it from the amount she borrowed.

First, let's calculate the total amount she will repay:
- She pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will repay is $165 * 12.

Next, we calculate the surcharge:
- The surcharge is 10% of the borrowed amount, so we calculate 10% of $2,000.

Finally, we subtract the total amount she will repay and the surcharge from the amount she borrowed to find out how much money she will have left.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total amount to be repaid: $165 * 12 = $1,980
2. Surcharge: 10% of $2,000 = $2,000 * 0.10 = $200

Let's denote:
- $A$ as Adrian's current age,
- $H$ as Harriet's current age,
- $Z$ as Zack's current age.

From the problem, we have:
1. $H = 21$ (Harriet's current age),
2. $A = 3H$ (Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age),
3. $H = \frac{1}{2}Z$ (Harriet's age is half of Zack's age).

First, we find Zack's current age:
\[ Z = 2H = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Next, we find Adrian's current age:
\[ A = 3H = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

Now, we calculate their ages three years from now:
- Adrian's age in three years: $A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66$,
- Harriet's age in three years: $H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24$,
- Zack's age in three years: $Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45$.

Finally, we calculate the average age of the three three years from now:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{(A + 3) + (H + 3) + (Z + 3)}{3} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

2. We know that \( N = 68 \).
3. Yuri scored 10 points more than half of Naomi's points, so \( Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10 \).
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so \( B = N + 17 \).
5. The total points scored by all four students is 251, so \( N + Y + B + J = 251 \).

\[ Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]
\[ B = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

mgsm-fr-228,"English translation: Kalinda and her mother are trying to solve a puzzle with 360 pieces. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mother places two times less per minute. How many hours will it take for them to finish the puzzle?

To solve this, we first need to determine the rate at which Kalinda's mother places the pieces. Since she places two times less than Kalinda, her rate is:

$$
\text{Mother's rate} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Kalinda's rate} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
$$

Now, we calculate the total time required for them to solve the puzzle together:

$$
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{4 + 2} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}

mgsm-fr-229,"The question is in French, and we need to translate it to English. Then, we will answer it in English.

Translation: A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashley visited the farm two months later and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested and brought them home. Two weeks later, Ashley returned to the farm, and 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, so she harvested them. How many watermelons were not yet ready for harvest after these two weeks?

Answer: Let's calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks:

1. Ashley brought home 30% of the watermelons, which is 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons.
2. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, so the number of watermelons ready after two weeks is 3/4 * (120 - 36) = 3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons.
3. Therefore, the number of watermelons not yet ready for harvest after these two weeks is 120 - 36 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

So, the answer is $\\boxed{21}$ watermelons.",21,21

Steve now wants to eat more tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend per day, with 6 tomatoes per day. Knowing that a vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, how many vines does he need?

To answer this, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per day and then determine how many vines are required to produce that amount of tomatoes.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes Steve eats per day:
- His girlfriend eats 6 tomatoes per day.
- Steve eats twice as many as his girlfriend, so he eats \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tomatoes per day.

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, Steve eats \(12 \times 7 = 84\) tomatoes per week.

Now, we need to determine how many vines are required to produce 84 tomatoes per week. Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes per vine:
- \( \frac{84}{3} = 28 \) vines.

\[ \text{White yarn rolls} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Now, we add the rolls of blue yarn and white yarn together to find the total number of rolls needed:

Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay for them?

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. The price of the first glass is $5.
2. The price of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.
3. The price of the third glass is 60% of $3, which is $1.80.
4. The price of the fourth glass is 60% of $1.80, which is $1.08.
5. This pattern continues for the remaining 14 glasses.

We can see that the price of each glass forms a geometric sequence where the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.6\).

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Here, \(n = 16\), \(a = 5\), and \(r = 0.6\).

Let's calculate the total cost:

\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - 0.6^{16}}{1 - 0.6} \]

First, calculate \(0.6^{16}\):

\[ 0.6^{16} \approx 0.000531441 \]

Now, substitute this value into the formula:

\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - 0.000531441}{0.4} \]
\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{0.999468559}{0.4} \]
\[ S_{16} = 5 \times 2.4986713975 \]
\[ S_{16} \approx 12.4933569875 \]

How far is he from his home at the end of 4 hours?

Now, let's calculate the distance:

1. **First 3 hours at 60 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **1.5 hours detour back home:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Next half hour at 30 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}

To find out how many years it takes for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then determine how many years it takes to reach a positive profit.

First, calculate the annual profit from the citrons:
\[ \text{Annual profit from citrons} = (\text{Annual yield} \times \text{Price per citron}) - \text{Annual cost of arrosage and nutrition} \]
\[ \text{Annual profit from citrons} = (7 \times 1.5) - 3 \]
\[ \text{Annual profit from citrons} = 10.5 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Annual profit from citrons} = 7.5 \]

Next, calculate the total profit after \( n \) years:
\[ \text{Total profit after } n \text{ years} = n \times \text{Annual profit from citrons} \]
\[ \text{Total profit after } n \text{ years} = n \times 7.5 \]

Carlos starts making a profit when the total profit is greater than the initial cost of planting the citronnier:
\[ n \times 7.5 > 90 \]
\[ n > \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n > 12 \]

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as \( x \).
2. At the house green, she sold a third of them, so she had \( \frac{2}{3}x \) left.
3. At the house red, she sold 2 more, so she had \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) left.
4. At the house orange, she sold half of what was left, so she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \) left.
5. We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 12

2. She took 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles.
3. She took another hour to cover the next 2 miles.
4. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles, we can use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

We know the total distance is 12 miles and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour. We need to find the total time taken for the entire hike.

First, calculate the time taken for the first part of the hike:
- 4 miles at 1 hour per mile = 4 hours
- 2 miles at 1 hour per mile = 2 hours

Total time for the first 6 miles = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours

Now, let's denote the time taken for the remaining 6 miles as \( t \) hours.

The total time for the entire hike is the sum of the time taken for the first 6 miles and the time taken for the remaining 6 miles:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} + t \text{ hours} \]

The total distance is 12 miles, and the average speed is 4 miles per hour. Therefore, the total time can also be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, we have:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} + t \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = 3 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ t = -3 \text{ hours} \]

This result is incorrect because the time cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The total time for the entire hike should be:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time taken for the remaining 6 miles should be:
\[ t = 3 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{4 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ t = 3 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ t = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining 6 miles:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$ miles per hour.",4,6

I have 10 liters of orange juice, which is two-thirds water. If I mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is three-quarters water, and I accidentally pour out 1 liter of orange juice, how much water is there in the remaining 24 liters?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of water and orange juice in the initial mixture:**
   - Orange juice: 10 liters
   - Water: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters

2. **Determine the amount of water and orange juice in the pineapple juice:**
   - Pineapple juice: 15 liters
   - Water: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} \) liters

3. **Calculate the total amount of water and orange juice before mixing:**
   - Total water: \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{45}{4} \)
   - Total orange juice: 10 liters

4. **Convert the fractions to a common denominator (12) and add them:**
   - Total water: \( \frac{20 \times 4}{3 \times 4} + \frac{45 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{80}{12} + \frac{135}{12} = \frac{215}{12} \) liters
   - Total orange juice: 10 liters

5. **Calculate the total volume of the mixture before mixing:**
   - Total volume: \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters

6. **Determine the amount of orange juice and water in the 1 liter of orange juice that was poured out:**
   - Orange juice: 1 liter
   - Water: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \) liters

7. **Calculate the remaining water and orange juice in the 24 liters:**
   - Remaining water: \( \frac{215}{12} - \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Remaining orange juice: 10 liters

8. **Convert the fractions to a common denominator (12) and subtract them:**
   - Remaining water: \( \frac{215}{12} - \frac{8}{12} = \frac{207}{12} \) liters
   - Remaining orange juice: 10 liters

9. **Calculate the total remaining volume:**
   - Total remaining volume: \( \frac{207}{12} + 10 \)

10. **Convert 10 liters to a fraction with a denominator of 12:**
    - 10 liters = \( \frac{120}{12} \) liters

11. **Add the fractions:**
    - Total remaining volume: \( \frac{207}{12} + \frac{120}{12} = \frac{327}{12} \) liters

12. **Simplify the fraction:**

Now, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boxes Cynthia buys in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every evening.
   - There are 60 days in 60 days.
   - Therefore, she will buy 60 portions of ice cream in 60 days.
   - Since each box contains 15 portions, the number of boxes she buys is:

Let's denote Darell's age as $7x$ and Allen's age as $11x$. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162, so we have:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18 to solve for $x$:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying $x$ by 11:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find the age Allen will have in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

Gunter tries to count candies in a jar. He asks his friends to estimate the quantity. One of them says 80 candies. Another says 20 more than half of the first. The third says 25% more than the first. What is the average of their estimates?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the first estimate as \( x \). According to the problem, the second estimate is 20 more than half of the first estimate, so it is \( \frac{x}{2} + 20 \). The third estimate is 25% more than the first estimate, so it is \( x + 0.25x = 1.25x \).

2. We know that the sum of their estimates is 80 candies:
   \[
   x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 20 \right) + 1.25x = 80
   \]

3. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 20 + 1.25x = 80
   \]
   \[
   x + 0.5x + 1.25x + 20 = 80

4. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2.75x = 80 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2.75x = 60

   \[
   x = \frac{60}{2.75}
   \]
   \[
   x = 21.818181818181816

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of yogurt per day and then multiply it by 30 days.

1. **Calculate the cost of yogurt per day:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts each day.
   - The price of 4 yogurts is $5.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of 2 yogurts is:

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Jean sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he earns $15 * 13 = $195 from selling his Lego sets.
2. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so he spends $20 * 8 = $160 on video games.
3. After buying the video games, he has $5 left.

Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets he has left. We know he started with 13 Lego sets and spent $160 on video games, so we can calculate the number of Lego sets he has left as follows:

Number of Lego sets left = Initial number of Lego sets - Amount spent on video games
Number of Lego sets left = 13 - $160 / $15
Number of Lego sets left = 13 - 10.67
Number of Lego sets left = 2.33

   - Jeannot court 3 jours par semaine.
   - Le premier jour, il court pendant 3 heures.
   - Les deux autres jours, il court deux fois moins longtemps que le premier jour.

   Let's denote the time spent running on the second day as \( t \).
   - Since he runs two times less on the second day, the time spent running on the second day is \( \frac{t}{2} \).
   - The time spent running on the third day is also \( \frac{t}{2} \).

   The total time spent running each week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ jours} \times (3 \text{ heures} + t \text{ heures} + \frac{t}{2} \text{ heures}) = 3 \times \left(3 + t + \frac{t}{2}\right) = 3 \times \left(3 + \frac{3t}{2}\right) = 9 + \frac{9t}{2}

2. **Determine the total distance Jeannot runs each week:**
   - Jeannot runs 60 miles each week.
   - The total distance can be calculated by multiplying the total time spent running by his speed.

   Let \( v \) be Jeannot's speed in miles per hour.
   - The total distance is:
   \[
   9 + \frac{9t}{2} \times v = 60

   \[
   \frac{9t}{2} \times v = 60 - 9

Dana runs four times faster than she walks, but jumps twice as fast as she runs. If she jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she cover in six hours, given that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Let \( v \) be Dana's walking speed in miles per hour.
   - Then, her running speed is \( 4v \) miles per hour.
   - Her jumping speed is \( 2 \times 4v = 8v \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the time running and \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time walking.
   - In 6 hours, the time spent running is \( 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \) hours.
   - The time spent walking is \( 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance covered in each activity:**
   - Distance covered by running: \( 2 \times 4v = 8v \) miles.
   - Distance covered by walking: \( 4 \times v = 4v \) miles.

   - Total distance covered = Distance covered by running + Distance covered by walking
   - Total distance covered = \( 8v + 4v = 12v \) miles.

5. **Determine the value of \( v \):**
   - We know her jumping speed is 3 miles per hour, so \( 8v = 3 \).
   - Solving for \( v \): \( v = \frac{3}{8} \) miles per hour.

6. **Calculate the total distance covered:**

mgsm-fr-41,"English translation: Perg, the great dragon, was sitting at the top of the Mount Farbo and spitting fire over a distance of 1,000 feet. Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but at a distance of 400 feet, which was well within the range of his flames. However, when Polly held the precious stone, she could throw it three times farther. At what distance could Polly maintain her distance from the dragon's flames while still being able to throw the golden javelin?
Let's denote the distance Polly can throw the golden javelin as \( x \) feet. Since Polly can throw the precious stone three times farther than the golden javelin, the distance she can throw the precious stone is \( 3x \) feet. The total distance from the dragon to the point where Polly can throw the precious stone is the sum of the distance from the dragon to the point where Polly can throw the golden javelin and the distance from that point to the point where Polly can throw the precious stone. This total distance must be less than or equal to the distance from the dragon to the point where Polly can throw the golden javelin, which is 1,000 feet. Therefore, we have the inequality:
\[ 1000 + 3x \leq 1000 \]
Simplifying this inequality, we get:
\[ 3x \leq 0 \]
\[ x \leq 0 \]
Since \( x \) represents a distance, it must be a positive value. Therefore, the only solution is:

This means that Polly cannot maintain her distance from the dragon's flames while still being able to throw the golden javelin. However, if we consider the problem in a different way, we can say that Polly can maintain her distance from the dragon's flames while still being able to throw the golden javelin if she throws the golden javelin at a distance of 333.33 feet. This is because the distance from the dragon to the point where Polly can throw the golden javelin is 1,000 feet, and the distance from that point to the point where Polly can throw the precious stone is \( 3 \times 333.33 = 1000 \) feet, which is less than or equal to 1,000 feet. Therefore, the distance Polly can maintain her distance from the dragon's flames while still being able to throw the golden javelin is:

mgsm-fr-42,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Grand-mère Jones prepared 5 apple pies for the firefighters' lunch. She then cut each pie into 8 parts and placed the five pies on the buffet table so that each guest could serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after all guests had taken and eaten their pies, there were 14 parts left. How many guests were there?

Now, let's answer the question in English:

Let's denote the number of guests as \( n \). Each guest took 8 parts of the pie. After all guests have taken their parts, there are 14 parts left. Therefore, the total number of parts taken by the guests plus the remaining parts equals the total number of parts initially prepared, which is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) parts.

So, we have the equation:
\[ 8n + 14 = 40 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ 8n = 40 - 14 \]
\[ 8n = 26 \]
\[ n = \frac{26}{8} \]
\[ n = 3.25 \]

Since the number of guests must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the total number of parts taken by the guests plus the remaining parts equals the total number of parts initially prepared, which is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) parts. So, we have:
\[ 8n + 14 = 40 \]
\[ 8n = 26 \]
\[ n = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of guests is \( \boxed{3} \).",3,26

""Based on its nutritional information, a bag of chips contains 250 calories per portion. If a bag of 300 g contains 5 portions, how many grams of chips will you eat, knowing that your daily calorie goal is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?""

Now, let's answer the question in English:

To determine how many grams of chips you will eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you can consume without exceeding your daily goal of 2000 calories.
3. Calculate the number of portions you can eat based on the remaining calories.
4. Convert the number of portions into grams of chips.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the bag of chips.
The bag contains 300 g and 5 portions, so the total number of calories is:
\[ 250 \text{ calories/portion} \times 5 \text{ portions} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Determine how many calories you can consume without exceeding your daily goal of 2000 calories.
You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you can consume:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of portions you can eat based on the remaining calories.
Since each portion contains 250 calories, you can eat:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/portion}} = 0.8 \text{ portions} \]

Step 4: Convert the number of portions into grams of chips.
Since each portion weighs 300 g, 0.8 portions weigh:
\[ 0.8 \times 300 \text{ g} = 240 \text{ g} \]

Therefore, you will eat $240$ grams of chips.",240,48

Charlie wants to sell honey candles. Each pound of honey candle allows him to produce 10 waxed candles. A pound of honey candle and wicks is priced at $10. If he produces and sells 20 candles, what is his net profit, knowing that each candle is sold for $2?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total cost of materials:
   - Each pound of honey candle costs $10.
   - Charlie produces 20 candles.
   - Therefore, the total cost of materials is $10 × 20 = $200.

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:
   - Each candle is sold for $2.
   - Charlie sells 20 candles.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is $2 × 20 = $40.

3. Calculate the net profit:
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of materials
   - Net profit = $40 - $200 = -$160.

Therefore, the net profit is $-160, which means Charlie has a net loss of $160.",160,20

Méridith is a freelance blogger whose work consists of writing articles on health themes and submitting them daily to clients. A blog post typically takes 4 hours of work, which includes research and writing. Last week, she wrote 5 blog posts on Monday and 2/5 times more on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many posts as on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over these three days.

To find the total number of hours spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of hours spent on each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours
2. **Tuesday**: 2/5 times more than Monday = 2/5 * 5 articles = 2 articles
   2 articles * 4 hours/article = 8 hours
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Tuesday = 2 * 2 articles = 4 articles
   4 articles * 4 hours/article = 16 hours

At work, she placed one note on each of the 220 coffee cups. If after that there were only 23 notes left, how many notes were in the packet she bought?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of notes in the packet Candice bought. We know the following:

1. Candice initially had 80 notes.
2. She placed one note on each of the 220 coffee cups, so she used 220 notes.
3. After placing the notes, she had 23 notes left.

Let's denote the number of notes in the packet Candice bought as \( x \). The total number of notes she had initially is the sum of the notes she bought and the notes she used. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 80 + x = 220 + 23 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 80 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of notes in the packet Candice bought is \( \boxed{163} \).",163,163

Total number of portions needed = Number of people × Number of portions per person
Total number of portions needed = 20 × 4 = 80 portions

Now, we divide the total number of portions needed by the number of portions per pizza:

Number of pizzas needed = Total number of portions needed ÷ Number of portions per pizza
Number of pizzas needed = 80 ÷ 8 = 10 pizzas

Therefore, Jean should order 10 pizzas.",10,10

Next, let's break down the information we need to solve the problem:

1. Mike has corresponded with 5 people.
2. He stopped correspondences with 2 of them.
3. The remaining 3 people send 2 letters of 5 pages every week.
4. He replies in the same way.
5. He can write one page every 6 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes per week:

- Each of the 3 people sends 2 letters of 5 pages each week, so they send a total of \(3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30\) pages per week.
- Since Mike replies in the same way, he also writes 30 pages per week.

Therefore, the total number of pages he writes per week is \(30 + 30 = 60\) pages.

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends writing per week:

- He writes one page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, he spends \(60 \times 6 = 360\) minutes writing per week.

\[ -28 = 2(2x) \]

\[ -28 = 4x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{-28}{4} \]

\[ x = -7 \]

Since the number of fish cannot be negative, we must have made an error in our interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the given information.

The problem states that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is equal to two times the sum of the number of fish in both aquariums. However, the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and in the second aquarium is 32. The difference between these two numbers is:

For the first 40 hours of work in a week, Ella's hourly rate is $10. For her overtime hours, she receives an additional payment equivalent to 1.2 times her normal hourly rate. If Ella worked 45 hours this week, what will be her weekly salary?

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. Ella's normal hourly rate is $10.
2. She worked 45 hours in total, which includes 40 hours at her normal rate and 5 hours of overtime.
3. For the overtime hours, she gets paid 1.2 times her normal hourly rate.

First, calculate the overtime pay:
\[ \text{Overtime pay} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 1.2 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total pay:
\[ \text{Total pay} = \text{Normal pay} + \text{Overtime pay} = 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} + 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total pay:
\[ \text{Total pay} = 400 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 460 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ella's weekly salary is $460.",460,460

A new program was downloaded 60 times in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month. It then decreased by 30% in the third month. How many times in total was the program downloaded during these three months?

To solve this, we'll calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. First month: 60 downloads
2. Second month: 3 times the first month = 3 * 60 = 180 downloads
3. Third month: 70% of the second month's downloads = 0.7 * 180 = 126 downloads

Now, we sum up the downloads for all three months:

60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads

Therefore, the total number of times the program was downloaded during these three months is $366$.",366,366

polymath-low-fr-12,"English translation: Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The planting cost is $90. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which will be sold at $1.5 each. The watering and fertilization of the tree cost $3 per year. How many years will it take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then determine how many years it will take to reach a break-even point.

1. **Calculate the annual profit:**
   - Annual revenue from lemons: \( 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \)
   - Annual cost of planting: \( \$90 \)
   - Annual cost of watering and fertilization: \( \$3 \)
   - Net annual profit: \( \$10.5 - \$90 - \$3 = -\$82.5 \)

Since the net annual profit is negative ($82.5), Carlos will not start earning money until after the first year. Therefore, it will take Carlos **1 year** to start earning money from his lemon tree.

The answer is \( \boxed{1} \) year.",1,13
polymath-low-fr-13,"The question is already in English, so we don't need to translate it. Let's answer it:

Let's denote the initial number of aspirators as \( x \).

1. Mélanie sold one-third of her aspirators at the green house: \( \frac{x}{3} \).
2. She then sold 2 aspirators at the red house: \( 2 \).
3. After these sales, she sold half of the remaining aspirators at the orange house: \( \frac{1}{2} \times (x - \frac{x}{3} - 2) \).

The remaining aspirators after all these sales is given as 5. So we can set up the equation:

\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \times (x - \frac{x}{3} - 2) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

First, simplify the equation:

\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \times (x - \frac{x}{3} - 2) = 5 \]

\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \times x + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]

\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \times x + \frac{1}{6} \times x + 1 = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - \frac{1}{2} \times x + \frac{1}{6} \times x - 1 = 5 \]

\[ x - \frac{2x}{6} - \frac{3x}{6} + \frac{x}{6} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ x - \frac{4x}{6} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

\[ x = 18 \]

In a dance class with 20 students, 20% are enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance?

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first calculate the percentage of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:

- Contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students
- Jazz dance: 25% of 20 students = 0.25 * 20 = 5 students

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

- Hip-hop dance: 20 students - 4 students (contemporary) - 5 students (jazz) = 11 students

Finally, we calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

   - The amount of water in the OJ is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
   - The amount of orange juice in the OJ is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 10 = \frac{10}{3} \) liters.
   - The total volume of the mixture is 10 liters.

2. **Adding Pineapple Juice:**
   - We add 15 liters of pineapple juice (PJ) composed of three-quarters water and one-quarter pineapple juice.
   - The amount of water in the PJ is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} \) liters.
   - The amount of pineapple juice in the PJ is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 15 = \frac{15}{4} \) liters.
   - The total volume of the mixture after adding the pineapple juice is \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters.

3. **Mixing Orange Juice with Pineapple Juice:**
   - We mix 10 liters of orange juice with 15 liters of pineapple juice.

polymath-low-fr-30,"The ages of Darell and Allen are in the ratio of 7:11. If the sum of their current ages is 162, calculate the age Allen will have in 10 years.

Let's denote Darell's current age as \( 7x \) and Allen's current age as \( 11x \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162, so we can write the equation:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 18x = 162 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 18:

\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darell and Allen:

- Darell's current age: \( 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63 \)
- Allen's current age: \( 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \)

To find the age Allen will have in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{109} \).",109,109
polymath-low-fr-31,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Gunter tries to count candies in a jar. He asks his friends to estimate the quantity. One of them says 80. Another says 20 more than half of the first. A third says 25% more than the first. What is the average of their estimates?

Now, let's break down the problem:

1. The first friend estimates 80 candies.
2. The second friend estimates 20 more than half of the first estimate, which is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) candies.
3. The third friend estimates 25% more than the first estimate, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) candies.

Now, we calculate the average of their estimates:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{80}$ candies.",80,80
