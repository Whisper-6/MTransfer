Let's calculate the total number of units:
\[ \text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Since 3/4 of the units are occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Therefore, the number of units that are not occupied is:
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \]

**English Translation:**
Lloyd has a chicken farm. He lays 252 eggs per day. He sells them for $2 per dozen. How much money does Lloyd make per week?

**Answer:**
To find out how much money Lloyd makes per week, we need to calculate his weekly earnings from selling eggs. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs laid in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Number of eggs per day} = 252
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days in a week} = 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total eggs per week} = 252 \times 7 = 1764
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the eggs:**
   \[
   \text{Price per dozen} = \$2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = \frac{1764}{12} \times 2 = 147 \times 2 = \$294
   \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs.

mgsm-th-51,"English translation: Tom's boat travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. He traveled from 13:00 to 16:00. Then he traveled back with a speed of 6 miles per hour. How many hours did he travel back?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time taken for Tom to travel back to the starting point. 

1. First, calculate the distance Tom traveled from 13:00 to 16:00:
   - Time from 13:00 to 16:00 is 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. Next, calculate the time taken to travel back with a speed of 6 miles per hour:
   - Distance = 30 miles.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, the answer is 5 hours.",5,5

Question: Car repair workers charge different rates for tire changes on trucks and cars. For truck tires, the worker charges $60 per tire, and for car tires, the worker charges $40 per tire. On a Tuesday, the worker changed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On a Wednesday, the worker changed 12 car tires and did not change any truck tires. On which day did the worker earn more money, and by how much?

Answer: Let's calculate the earnings for each day.

For Tuesday:
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total earnings on Tuesday: $360 + $160 = $520

For Wednesday:
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60/tire = $0
- Total earnings on Wednesday: $480 + $0 = $480

Comparing the earnings:
- Tuesday earnings: $520
- Wednesday earnings: $480

Difference in earnings: $520 - $480 = $40

The worker earned more money on Tuesday by $40.",40,40

A wooden bridge can bear a maximum weight of 5000 pounds. A truck transporting boxes that weigh the same amount as each box, which is 15 pounds, can cross the bridge. If the total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, what is the maximum number of boxes the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the maximum weight the truck can carry and then divide that by the weight of one box to find the maximum number of boxes it can carry.

1. Calculate the total weight of the driver and the empty truck:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's maximum weight to find the maximum weight the boxes can carry:
   \[
   \text{Maximum weight of boxes} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Divide the maximum weight of the boxes by the weight of one box to find the maximum number of boxes:
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \text{ boxes}

Answer: Steve's total order amount is $40.00. The service charges a 25% fee on his total amount, which is $40.00 * 25% = $10.00. The delivery fee is $3.00 and the tip is $4.00. Therefore, the total amount of Steve's order is $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00. The answer is $57.00.",0,57

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total amount Genet spent, which includes the cost of the material, the cost of the diamond polishing, and the insurance cost.

1. Cost of material: $500
2. Cost of diamond polishing: $800
3. Insurance cost: 10% of the total amount spent

Let's calculate the insurance cost first:
\[ \text{Insurance cost} = 10\% \times (\text{Cost of material} + \text{Cost of diamond polishing}) \]
\[ \text{Insurance cost} = 0.10 \times (500 + 800) \]
\[ \text{Insurance cost} = 0.10 \times 1300 \]
\[ \text{Insurance cost} = 130 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Cost of material} + \text{Cost of diamond polishing} + \text{Insurance cost} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 500 + 800 + 130 \]

Let's break down the problem:

1. Marcy worked in the same company for 40 years.
2. She receives $50,000 per year starting from 20.
3. She gets a 5% increase each year.
4. She retires after 30 years.

To calculate her total earnings, we need to sum up the annual payments for 30 years, considering the 5% annual increase.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:
\[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \]
where:
- \( S \) is the sum of the series,
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( l \) is the last term.

In this case:
- \( n = 30 \) (years),
- \( a = 50,000 \) (first year's payment),
- \( l = 50,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{29} \) (last year's payment).

Let's calculate the last year's payment:
\[ l = 50,000 \times (1.05)^{29} \]

Now, let's calculate the total sum of the series:
\[ S = \frac{30}{2} \times (50,000 + 50,000 \times (1.05)^{29}) \]

\[ S = 15 \times (50,000 \times (1 + (1.05)^{29})) \]

\[ S = 15 \times 50,000 \times (1.05)^{29} \]

\[ S = 750,000 \times (1.05)^{29} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.05)^{29} \):
\[ (1.05)^{29} \approx 3.843 \]

Finally, we multiply:
\[ S = 750,000 \times 3.843 \]

\[ S \approx 2,882,250 \]

\[ R = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we know that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:
\[ E = 2 \times R = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, to find the total number of jewels, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

2. The interest rate is 2% per month.
3. The total number of months is 3.

First, calculate the monthly interest:
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Cost of Phone} \times \text{Interest Rate} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = 150 \times 0.02 = 3 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the phone including interest:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Phone} + (\text{Monthly Interest} \times \text{Number of Months}) \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 150 + (3 \times 3) \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 150 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 159 \]

So, Cheryl will have to pay $159 per month for 3 months.",3,255

Arty sells flowers at the farmers' market. He sells three types of flowers: daffodils, tulips, and begonias. Normally, he sells daffodils in pots for $2.74 each, tulips in pots for $1.87 each, and begonias in pots for $2.12 each. However, today Arty doesn't have change, so he decides to reduce the prices of all flowers. If Arty sells 12 daffodils, 9 tulips, and 17 begonias, how much money will he make in total?

To find the total money Arty will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then sum them up.

1. Revenue from daffodils:
\[ 12 \text{ pots} \times \$2.74 \text{ per pot} = \$32.88 \]

2. Revenue from tulips:
\[ 9 \text{ pots} \times \$1.87 \text{ per pot} = \$16.83 \]

3. Revenue from begonias:
\[ 17 \text{ pots} \times \$2.12 \text{ per pot} = \$36.04 \]

Now, we sum up the revenues:
\[ \$32.88 + \$16.83 + \$36.04 = \$85.75 \]

Therefore, Arty will make $85.75 in total.",75,88

mgsm-th-77,"The question is already in English, so no translation is needed. Here is the answer:

Let's denote the amount of fabric that Raymond, Sarah, and David have as \( R \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively.

According to the problem:
1. Raymond has less fabric than Sarah's half, so \( R < \frac{S}{2} \).
2. Sarah has more fabric than David's four times, so \( S > 4D \).

We are given that Sarah has 400 pounds of fabric, so \( S = 400 \).

From \( S > 4D \), we get \( 400 > 4D \), which simplifies to \( D < 100 \).

From \( R < \frac{S}{2} \), we get \( R < \frac{400}{2} \), which simplifies to \( R < 200 \).

Since \( D < 100 \) and \( R < 200 \), the possible values for \( D \) and \( R \) are limited. To find the exact values, we need to check the constraints.

Let's assume \( D = 99 \) (the maximum possible value for David's fabric that still satisfies \( D < 100 \)). Then \( R < 200 \), and since \( R < \frac{400}{2} = 200 \), the maximum possible value for \( R \) is 199.

Therefore, the difference between the fabric that Raymond and David have is \( R - D \). If \( D = 99 \) and \( R = 199 \), then the difference is \( 199 - 99 = 100 \).

So, the answer is \( \boxed{100} \).",100,100
mgsm-th-78,"The question is already in English, so no translation is needed. Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the price per flower for each option:**
   - For 3 flowers at $2.50, the price per flower is:
     \[
     \frac{2.50}{3} = \frac{250}{300} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ dollars per flower}
     \]
   - For 2 flowers at $1, the price per flower is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \text{ dollars per flower}
     \]

2. **Compare the prices:**
   - The price per flower for 3 flowers at $2.50 is $\frac{5}{6}$ dollars.
   - The price per flower for 2 flowers at $1 is $\frac{1}{2}$ dollars.

3. **Determine which option is cheaper:**
   - To compare $\frac{5}{6}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 2 is 6.
   - Convert $\frac{1}{2}$ to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}
     \]
   - Now compare $\frac{5}{6}$ and $\frac{3}{6}$. Clearly, $\frac{3}{6} < \frac{5}{6}$.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the cheaper price, the cost is:
     \[
     18 \times \frac{3}{6} = 18 \times 0.5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the more expensive price, the cost is:
     \[
     18 \times \frac{5}{6} = 18 \times 0.8333 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the savings:**
   - The savings is the difference between the more expensive and cheaper prices:
     \[
     15 - 9 = 6 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, Vincent would save $6 by buying 18 flowers at the cheaper price. The answer is $6.",6,6

   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}

A football team played 22 matches and won more matches than it lost by 8 matches. How many matches did the football team win?

To answer this question, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of matches won by the team as \( W \) and the number of matches lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of matches played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more matches than it lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( W \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of matches lost is 7, we can find the number of matches won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won 15 matches.

There are 20 full-grown dinosaurs and 5 baby dinosaurs at the picnic. How many pounds of fried green beans should Tod bring to the picnic so that there is enough for all the dinosaurs?

To solve this, we can calculate the total amount of fried green beans needed for the full-grown dinosaurs and the baby dinosaurs separately, and then sum them up.

For the full-grown dinosaurs:
- Each full-grown dinosaur eats 10 pounds.
- There are 20 full-grown dinosaurs.
- Total fried green beans for full-grown dinosaurs = 10 pounds/dinosaur * 20 dinosaurs = 200 pounds.

For the baby dinosaurs:
- Each baby dinosaur eats half the amount of a full-grown dinosaur, which is 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.
- There are 5 baby dinosaurs.
- Total fried green beans for baby dinosaurs = 5 pounds/dinosaur * 5 dinosaurs = 25 pounds.

Now, let's answer the question in English:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Goldy to run 400 meters after he has lost weight. We know that Lily runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, and Goldy runs 10% faster than Lily.

First, let's calculate Goldy's speed in meters per second:
\[ \text{Goldy's speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how much faster Goldy runs compared to Lily. Since he runs 10% faster:
\[ \text{Goldy's speed increase} = 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \times 10\% = 1.053 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we add this increase to Goldy's original speed to find his new speed:
\[ \text{Goldy's new speed} = 10.53 \text{ meters/second} + 1.053 \text{ meters/second} \approx 11.583 \text{ meters/second} \]

Finally, we calculate the time it takes for Goldy to run 400 meters at his new speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11.583 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 34.4 \text{ seconds} \]

Here, the initial price is $20, the interest rate is 20% or 0.20, and the number of periods is 36 months / 2 months = 18 periods.

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Eggs per basket**: 9 eggs

\[ \text{Total eggs needed} = 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we know that each basket contains 9 eggs, so we can find out how many baskets are needed:

\[ \text{Baskets needed} = \frac{\text{Total eggs needed}}{\text{Eggs per basket}} \]

\[ B = \frac{26}{3} \]
\[ B = 8.67 \]

Now, substitute \( B \) back into the equation \( S = 2B \) to find \( S \):

To answer this, we need to calculate the ages of each bird:

1. Sally Four is as old as Sally Thirty-two, which is 8 years old.
2. Sally Two is older than Sally Four by three years, so Sally Two is \(8 + 3 = 11\) years old.
3. Granny Red is older than Sally Four by four times, so Granny Red is \(4 \times 11 = 44\) years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 8 years

If Sandra wants to continue her business, how many red roses should Fred deliver by 17:00?

Answer: Let's denote the number of carnations as \( C \). According to the problem, Sandra orders four times as many red roses as carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4C \). She also orders 200 more pink lilacs than carnations, which is five times more than the carnations, so the number of pink lilacs is \( 5C + 200 \).

The total number of flowers Sandra orders is the sum of the carnations, red roses, and pink lilacs:

Since Sandra wants to continue her business, she needs to deliver all the flowers by 17:00. Therefore, the number of red roses she needs to deliver is:
\[ 4C \]

To find \( C \), we need to determine the minimum number of carnations Sandra needs to order. Since \( C \) must be a positive integer, the smallest value for \( C \) is 1. Therefore, the number of red roses Sandra needs to deliver is:

5. We are given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than Jean. So, two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \) and Jean's age was \( J - 2 \). This gives us the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = (J - 2) + 5
   \]
6. Simplifying the second equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (J - 2)
   \]
   \[
   2(M - 2) = J - 2
   \]
   \[
   2M - 4 = J - 2
   \]
   \[
   2M - J = 2
   \]
7. Simplifying the third equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = J - 2 + 5
   \]
   \[
   M - 2 = J + 3
   \]
   \[
   M = J + 5
   \]
8. Now we have two equations:
   \[
   2M - J = 2
   \]
   \[
   M = J + 5
   \]
9. Substitute \( M = J + 5 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   2(J + 5) - J = 2
   \]
   \[
   2J + 10 - J = 2
   \]
   \[
   J + 10 = 2
   \]
   \[
   J = 2 - 10
   \]
   \[
   J = -8
   \]
10. Since Jean's age cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our steps. Let's go back to the correct interpretation of the problem and solve it again:

   From the problem, we know:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (J - 2)
   \]
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times (J - 2)
   \]
   \[
   2(M - 2) = J - 2
   \]
   \[
   2M - 4 = J - 2
   \]
   \[
   2M - J = 2
   \]
   \[
   M = J + 5
   \]
   \[
   J + 5 = 30 - 5
   \]
   \[
   J = 25
   \]

Therefore, the answer is $J = 25$.",25,23
mgsm-th-183,"The teams are competing in a 4x400m relay race. Each team has 4 members, and each member runs 400 meters. The first member of each team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, and the second member runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The third member runs 400 meters 3 seconds faster than the second member, and the fourth member runs 400 meters 3 seconds faster than the third member. The team that wins will be the one that finishes the race in the shortest time.

To find out how many seconds it will take for the winning team to finish the race, we need to calculate the total time for the winning team to complete the race.

1. The first member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
2. The second member runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
3. The third member runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
4. The fourth member runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.

Now, we add up the times for all four members to find the total time for the winning team:

\[ 55 + 60 + 57 + 54 = 226 \text{ seconds} \]

The winning team will finish the race in 226 seconds. Since the losing team will take longer to finish the race, we need to find out how many seconds faster the winning team will be compared to the losing team.

Assuming the losing team has the same average speed as the winning team, we can calculate the time it will take for the losing team to finish the race:

\[ \text{Time for losing team} = \frac{226 \text{ seconds}}{4} = 56.5 \text{ seconds} \]

The winning team will finish the race 226 - 56.5 = 169.5 seconds faster than the losing team.

Therefore, the winning team will finish the race $169.5$ seconds faster than the losing team.",5,2

2. **Favorable outcomes for rolling a number higher than 3**: The numbers higher than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

3. **Favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers consecutively**: The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. The two consecutive even numbers are 4 and 6. So, there is 1 favorable outcome.

4. **Probability of rolling a number higher than 3**:

   - Since Jennie collected half as many apples as her mother, we need to divide the number of apples her mother collected by 2.
   - \( \text{Number of apples Jennie collected} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of apples collected by both:**
   - Total apples = Number of apples collected by mother + Number of apples collected by Jennie

**Translation:** 
Russell works at a pet store and is giving hay to various pet animals. He keeps mice in cages, with 3 cages equally divided. Each mouse gets 6 pieces of hay. There are 10 hamsters, each getting 5 pieces of hay, and he gives 20 pieces of hay to all the rabbits. He doesn't need to give hay at the store except for this. If he gives 160 pieces of hay to all the small pet animals, how many mice are in each cage?

**Answer in English:**
Let's denote the number of mice in each cage as \( x \).

Since there are 3 cages and they are equally divided, the total number of mice is \( 3x \).

Each mouse gets 6 pieces of hay, so the total hay given to the mice is \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \).

There are 10 hamsters, and each gets 5 pieces of hay, so the total hay given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

There are 20 pieces of hay given to all the rabbits.

The total amount of hay given to all the animals is \( 160 \) pieces.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 18x + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18x + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18x = 90 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, there are \( 5 \) mice in each cage.",5,5
mgsm-th-187,"Question: Manley owes Benedict $100. They agreed to charge an interest rate of 2% per month. If Manley can pay off the debt in another 3 months, how much should Manley pay Benedict?

Answer: Let's denote the monthly payment Manley needs to make as \( P \).

The total amount Manley will owe after 3 months, including interest, can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P \times (1 + \frac{2\%}{100})^3 \]

We know that this total amount is $100, so we have:
\[ P \times (1 + 0.02)^3 = 100 \]
\[ P \times (1.02)^3 = 100 \]
\[ P \times 1.061208 = 100 \]
\[ P = \frac{100}{1.061208} \]
\[ P \approx 94.13 \]

So, Manley should pay Benedict approximately $94.13 per month to pay off the debt in another 3 months.

In a neighborhood where there are a total of more dogs and cats than hamsters, there are 22 hamsters. There are more cats than dogs by 2 times, and there are 60 dogs. How many animals are there in total in this neighborhood?

Let's denote:
- $D$ as the number of dogs,
- $C$ as the number of cats,
- $H$ as the number of hamsters.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. $D + C = H + 22$ (the number of dogs and cats is 22 more than the number of hamsters),
2. $C = 2D$ (there are 2 times as many cats as dogs),
3. $D = 60$ (there are 60 dogs).

Using the second equation, we can substitute $C$ with $2D$:
\[C = 2 \times 60 = 120\]

Now, using the first equation with the values of $D$ and $C$:
\[60 + 120 = H + 22\]
\[180 = H + 22\]
\[H = 180 - 22\]
\[H = 158\]

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the neighborhood:
\[D + C + H = 60 + 120 + 158 = 338\]

So, the total number of animals in the neighborhood is $338$.

To answer this question, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

According to the problem:
1. He doubled the amount from last year, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies this year.

Julia sails 100 feet back to the shore in 11 minutes and 30 seconds, and the shore is 640 seconds away from where she started. How much water will enter the boat when Julia sails back to the shore?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Julia to sail back to the shore and then determine how much water will enter the boat based on the given rate.

1. **Calculate the time to sail back to the shore:**
   - Julia sails 100 feet back to the shore in 11 minutes and 30 seconds.
   - Convert 11 minutes and 30 seconds to seconds: \( 11 \times 60 + 30 = 720 \) seconds.

mgsm-th-118,"English translation: At the large port of the tax-free zone SeaSide, customs officers counted 2 crates of imported vehicles. Each crate contained 5 vehicles. On the second day, more crates were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. How many crates were brought in on the second day if each crate contained 5 vehicles?

Answer: Let's denote the number of crates brought in on the second day as \( x \). Each crate contains 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles brought in on the second day is \( 5x \). The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is the sum of the vehicles from the first day and the vehicles from the second day, which is given as 30. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 5 \times 2 + 5x = 30 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 10 + 5x = 30 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 20 \]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 4 \]

So, the number of crates brought in on the second day is \( \boxed{4} \).",4,4

The total salary of Edwina is more than that of Layla by 30%. Four years later, Edwina's salary increased by 40% compared to the previous year's salary. If Edwina and Layla's salaries increased simultaneously and Layla's salary four years ago was $40,000, calculate their total salary four years later.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate Layla's salary four years ago:**
   Layla's salary four years ago = $40,000

2. **Calculate Edwina's salary four years ago:**
   Edwina's salary four years ago = Layla's salary four years ago + 30% of Layla's salary four years ago
   Edwina's salary four years ago = $40,000 + 0.30 * $40,000
   Edwina's salary four years ago = $40,000 + $12,000
   Edwina's salary four years ago = $52,000

3. **Calculate Edwina's salary four years later:**
   Edwina's salary four years later = Edwina's salary four years ago + 40% of Edwina's salary four years ago
   Edwina's salary four years later = $52,000 + 0.40 * $52,000
   Edwina's salary four years later = $52,000 + $20,800
   Edwina's salary four years later = $72,800

4. **Calculate Layla's salary four years later:**
   Layla's salary four years later = Layla's salary four years ago + 40% of Layla's salary four years ago
   Layla's salary four years later = $40,000 + 0.40 * $40,000
   Layla's salary four years later = $40,000 + $16,000
   Layla's salary four years later = $56,000

5. **Calculate the total salary of Edwina and Layla four years later:**
   Total salary = Edwina's salary four years later + Layla's salary four years later
   Total salary = $72,800 + $56,000
   Total salary = $128,800

Therefore, the total salary of Edwina and Layla four years later is $128,800.",800,95200

Julia initially had no spoons, so she bought \( x \) spoons. Her husband bought another set of 5 spoons, so she now has \( x + 5 \) spoons. She used 3 spoons for tasting, so she has \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \) spoons left. After arranging the table, she has 12 spoons in total, so we can set up the equation:

A woman sells mangoes, chili peppers, and lemons in the local market. One mango costs three times as much as one chili pepper. Lemons are cheaper than mangoes by $5. If a person buys 4 mangoes, 20 chili peppers, and 10 lemons, how much will they pay in total if chili peppers cost $15 each?

To solve this, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit:

1. **Mangoes**: Since one mango costs three times as much as one chili pepper, and chili peppers cost $15 each, one mango costs $15 * 3 = $45.
2. **Chili peppers**: Given that chili peppers cost $15 each.
3. **Lemons**: Since lemons are cheaper than mangoes by $5, one lemon costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

- **Mangoes**: 4 mangoes * $45/mango = $180
- **Chili peppers**: 20 chili peppers * $15/chili pepper = $300
- **Lemons**: 10 lemons * $40/lemon = $400

Finally, we sum up the costs to find the total amount:

   - Brian has 20 video games.
   - Brian's video games have been lost by 5.

2. **Calculate the number of video games Brian has before the loss:**
   - Brian has 20 video games.

3. **Determine the number of video games Bobby has:**
   - Bobby has fewer than 3 times the number of video games that Brian has.
   - Since Brian has 20 video games, 3 times that would be \(3 \times 20 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Bobby has fewer than 60 video games.

4. **Calculate the number of video games Bobby has after the loss:**
   - Brian's video games have been lost by 5.
   - So, Brian's video games are \(20 - 5 = 15\).
   - Therefore, Bobby has \(15\) video games.

5. **Determine the number of video games Bobby has:**

She pays the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost, and she wants to leave a tip of $5.00. How much will she need to pay for the order?

Answer: To find out how much Ronnie will need to pay for the order, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items:

- Sandwiches: 2 pieces * $7.50 = $15.00
- Fried chicken: 2 bags * $1.50 = $3.00
- Cookies: 2 pieces * $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Now, we calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost:

Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Finally, we add the delivery fee and the tip to find the total amount Ronnie needs to pay:

Total amount = Total cost of items + Delivery fee + Tip
Total amount = $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, Ronnie will need to pay $29.00 for the order.",0,29

Now, let's answer the question in English:

Mark took the first exam with 75 questions and answered them at a rate of 5 questions per hour. The time he has for the first exam is 8 hours, so the number of questions he can answer in that time is:

Let's denote:
- The number of gold coins as \( G \)
- The number of silver coins as \( S \)

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110: \( G + S = 110 \)
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins: \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final answer is:

2. Aaron has more gemstones than half of Raymon's by 5:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}R + 5 \]

3. Raymon has 40 gemstones:
\[ R = 40 \]

We can substitute the value of R into the second equation to find A:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2}(40) + 5 \]
\[ A = 20 + 5 \]
\[ A = 25 \]

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the first equation to find S:

### English Translation:
John was planning to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He had 13 sets of Lego, and he sold each set for $15. In the end, he bought 8 video games at $20 each, and he had $5 left. How many Lego sets did he have left?

### Solution:
1. Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:
   \[
   13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount of money John spent on the video games:
   \[
   8 \text{ games} \times \$20 \text{ per game} = \$160
   \]

3. Determine the amount of money John had left after buying the video games:
   \[
   \$195 - \$160 = \$35
   \]

4. Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, the total amount of money he had initially was:
   \[
   \$35 + \$5 = \$40
   \]

5. Calculate the total number of Lego sets John had initially:
   \[
   \frac{\$40}{\$15 \text{ per set}} = \frac{40}{15} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ sets}
   \]

6. Since John cannot have a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \boxed{2}

The total distance John runs in a week is $60$ miles, so we can set up the equation as follows:

\[3x + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}x = 60\]

Solving for $x$:

\[3x + x = 60\]

""Brandon's older iPhone is two years older than Ben's older iPhone, which is two years older than Suzie's older iPhone. If Suzie's older iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon's older iPhone?""

To answer this, we need to work backwards from Suzie's iPhone:

1. Suzie's older iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Suzie's older iPhone is two years older than Ben's older iPhone, so Ben's older iPhone is 1 - 2 = -1 years old. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of age, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.
3. The problem states that the difference between the older iPhones is the same as the difference between Suzie's and Ben's iPhones. So, if Suzie's older iPhone is 1 year old, and the difference between the older iPhones is 2 years, then Ben's older iPhone is 1 + 2 = 3 years old.
4. Finally, the difference between Ben's and Brandon's iPhones is 2 years, so Brandon's older iPhone is 3 + 2 = 5 years old.

Charles wants to sell wax candles made from beeswax. One pound of beeswax can make 10 candles. One pound of beeswax with wax is priced at $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, how much profit will he make if he sells 20 candles?

To find the profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

1. Calculate the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Price per candle} \times \text{Number of candles sold} \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$2.00 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$40.00 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$10.00 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$20.00 \]

3. Calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 \]

To solve this, we first calculate the total weight of the comic books:
\[ 30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds/comic book} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Let's denote the number of toys he needs to take out as \( x \). The total weight of the toys he needs to take out is:
\[ x \text{ toys} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ pounds/toy} = \frac{x}{2} \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the things he needs to take out (comic books and toys) is equal to the weight of the schoolbag, which is 15 pounds:
\[ 7.5 \text{ pounds} + \frac{x}{2} \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 15 - 7.5 \]

- Each box has a weight of 15 pounds.
- The total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

First, we need to find out the maximum weight that the truck can carry without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. We do this by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's maximum capacity:

\[ \text{Maximum weight capacity of the truck} = \text{Bridge's maximum capacity} - \text{Weight of the driver and the empty truck} \]
\[ \text{Maximum weight capacity of the truck} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} \]

To solve this, let's denote:
- The number of rubies as R
- The number of sapphires as S
- The number of diamonds as D

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

Dr. Weiss's school has a boy to girl ratio of 3:2. If the school has 60 girls and there is one teacher for every 5 students, how many teachers are there in total?

To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys in the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students.
3. Determine the number of teachers based on the student-to-teacher ratio.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys in the school.
The ratio of boys to girls is 3:2. This means for every 5 students, 3 are boys and 2 are girls. Since there are 60 girls, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of boys:

\[
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{60}

1. First, we need to calculate how many days are in the first 180 days:
   \[
   \text{Days in first 180 days} = 180 \text{ days}
   \]

2. For the first 180 days, the dog eats 1 cup of food per day. So, the total amount of food needed for the first 180 days is:
   \[
   \text{Food needed for first 180 days} = 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. After 180 days, the dog will need 2 cups of food per day. So, the total amount of food needed for the remaining days is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining days} = 365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days}

   \[
   \text{Food needed for remaining days} = 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}

**Question:** If Raymond washes less than half as many pieces of clothing as Sarah, and Sarah washes four times as many pieces of clothing as David, how many pieces of clothing does Raymond wash if Sarah washes 400 pieces of clothing?

**Answer:** Let's denote the number of pieces of clothing David washes as \( D \). According to the problem, Sarah washes four times as many pieces of clothing as David, so Sarah washes \( 4D \) pieces of clothing. We are given that Sarah washes 400 pieces of clothing, so we can write:

\[ 4D = 400 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

So, David washes 100 pieces of clothing. Since Raymond washes less than half as many pieces of clothing as Sarah, we can write:

\[ R < \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \]

And since Sarah washes 400 pieces of clothing, Raymond must wash less than 200 pieces of clothing. The only number less than 200 that is a multiple of 4 (since Sarah washes four times as many as David and David washes 100 pieces, which is a multiple of 4) is 100. Therefore, Raymond washes 100 pieces of clothing.

Thus, the number of pieces of clothing Raymond washes is \( \boxed{100} \).",100,100

Vincent can buy 3 flowers for $2.50 or 2 flowers for $1 if he buys 18 flowers at a cheaper price, how much money will he save?

To answer this, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the cheaper price and compare it to the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive price.

First, let's find the cheaper price per flower:
- The cheaper price for 3 flowers is $2.50, so the price per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (repeating).

Now, let's calculate the total cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers at the cheaper price:
- Total cost = 18 flowers * $0.8333 per flower = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers at the more expensive price:
- Total cost = 18 flowers * $1 per flower = $18.

Finally, let's find out how much money Vincent will save:
- Savings = Total cost at more expensive price - Total cost at cheaper price = $18 - $15.00 = $3.

Therefore, Vincent will save $3 by buying 18 flowers at the cheaper price.",18,6

A football team played 22 games and won more games than it lost by 8 games. How many games did the football team win?

To answer this question, let's denote the number of games won by the team as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of games played is 22:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]

2. The team won 8 more games than it lost:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( W \):
\[
(L + 8) + L = 22
\]
\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]
\[
2L = 14
\]
\[
L = 7
\]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- \( A \) for Emile
- \( J \) for Jack
- \( C \) for Corrie

We are given the following information:
1. Emile has 4 children: Emile, Jack, Corrie, and James.
2. Emile is older than Jack by 5 years.
3. Emile is younger than Corrie by 2 years.
4. James is 10 years old.
5. James is younger than Corrie by 1 year.

From the information, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( A = J + 5 \)
2. \( A = C - 2 \)
3. \( M = 10 \)
4. \( M = C - 1 \)

We need to find the age of Jack (\( J \)).

First, let's use the information about James:
\[ M = 10 \]
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now, we know Corrie's age:
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = 11 - 1 \]
\[ 10 = 10 \]

Next, we use the information about Emile:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we use the information about Emile's age relative to Jack:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Lily runs around the fence 400 meters faster than Goldy. However, Goldy changes his eating habits to lose weight, which makes him run 10% faster. If Lily runs around the fence in 38 seconds, how long will Goldy take to run around the fence if he has lost weight?

To answer this, we need to calculate Goldy's original speed and then determine how long it will take him to run 400 meters after losing weight.

1. Let's denote Lily's original speed as \( v_L \) and Goldy's original speed as \( v_G \).
2. Lily runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, so her speed is \( v_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \).
3. Goldy runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, so his speed is \( v_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \).
4. Goldy's speed after losing weight is \( v_G' = v_G \times 1.10 \) (since he runs 10% faster).
5. We need to find the time \( t_G \) it takes for Goldy to run 400 meters at his new speed \( v_G' \).

Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):

\[ t_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{v_G'} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{v_G \times 1.10} \]

Now, let's calculate \( v_G \) and \( v_G' \):

\[ v_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \]

\[ v_G' = 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \times 1.10 \approx 11.58 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we can calculate \( t_G \):

\[ t_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11.58 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 34.4 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Goldy will take approximately 34.4 seconds to run around the fence if he has lost weight.",4,36

To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
2. Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
3. Let \( A \) represent the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
- There are more dogs than cats by more than twenty.
- There are 60 dogs.
- There are more cats than dogs by two times.
- The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. \( D = 60 \)
2. \( D > C + 20 \)
3. \( C > D \)
4. \( A + D + C = \text{Total number of pets} \)

Using equation 1, we substitute \( D \) with 60:

1. \( 60 > C + 20 \)
2. \( C > 60 \)
3. \( A + 60 + C = \text{Total number of pets} \)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

1. From equation 1, we get:
\[ 60 > C + 20 \]
\[ 40 > C \]
\[ C < 40 \]

2. From equation 2, we get:
\[ C > 60 \]

Combining these two inequalities, we find that \( C \) must be between 60 and 40, which is impossible. This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's recheck the problem statement and the equations.

Given:
- \( D = 60 \)
- \( D > C + 20 \)
- \( C > D \)
- \( A + D + C = \text{Total number of pets} \)

From equation 1, we get:
\[ 60 > C + 20 \]
\[ 40 > C \]
\[ C < 40 \]

From equation 2, we get:
\[ C > 60 \]

This contradiction indicates that there is no valid solution for \( C \) under the given conditions. Therefore, the problem as stated has no solution.

Let \( A \) be the number of cookies Amy ate and \( C \) be the number of cookies Cody ate. According to the problem, Cody ate three times as many cookies as Amy, so we have:

\[ C = 3A \]

We are also given that Amy ate 5 cookies, so:

\[ A = 5 \]

Substituting \( A = 5 \) into the first equation, we get:

\[ C = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

So, Cody ate 15 cookies. Together, they ate:

\[ A + C = 5 + 15 = 20 \]

Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches his favorite program, which is 1 hour long, one episode per night. On Wednesday, he watches a 30-minute program, one episode. On Thursday, he finishes his homework quickly and watches a 1-hour program and a 30-minute program, one episode each. On Friday, he can stay up late because he's on vacation, so he watches a 1-hour program and two episodes of a 30-minute program. If he watches TV for a total of 7 hours, how many 30-minute episodes does he watch on Wednesday?

Let's break it down:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour per episode, 2 episodes = 2 hours
- Wednesday: 30 minutes per episode, 1 episode = 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 1 hour + 2 episodes of 30 minutes each = 1 + 2 * 0.5 = 2 hours

Total hours: 2 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 6.5 hours

Since he watches TV for a total of 7 hours, the remaining time is 7 - 6.5 = 0.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, he watches 0.5 / 0.5 = 1 episode on Wednesday.

Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$ episode.",1,3

When he bakes the cookies, he realizes he has made 15 more cookies than he should have. He drops 5 cookies while taking them out to cool down, and now he has 110 cookies. How many cookies did he bake last year?

Answer: Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). This year, he bakes \( 2x \) cookies. When he bakes, he realizes he has made 15 more cookies than he should have, so he should have baked \( 2x - 15 \) cookies. He drops 5 cookies while taking them out to cool down, so he actually baked \( 2x - 15 - 5 = 2x - 20 \) cookies. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2x - 20 = 110 \]
Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 65 \]
So, Henry baked 65 cookies last year. The answer is \( \boxed{65} \).",65,50

A local gas station sells gasoline at $3.00 per gallon. A company develops an app that offers a $0.20 rebate per gallon if you fill up at this station. If a customer buys 10 gallons of gasoline, how much will the gasoline cost after receiving the rebate?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline at $3.00 per gallon, and then subtract the total rebate amount.

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00
   \]

2. Calculate the total rebate amount for 10 gallons:
   \[
   \text{Total rebate} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00
   \]

3. Subtract the total rebate from the total cost to find the final amount:
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00

Therefore, the final amount the customer will pay for 10 gallons of gasoline after receiving the rebate is $28.00.",0,28
polymath-low-th-110,"Question: Marcelle and Berthe are competing to see who can eat the largest sheet of dried fruit. They both gather the largest sheets they can find. However, they made a mistake. Berthe's sheet of dried fruit is 24 cm wide and 14 cm long, while Marcelle's sheet is 3 cm wide and 14 cm long. If they eat all the dried fruit, how much did they eat on average?

Answer: To find the average amount of dried fruit eaten by Marcelle and Berthe, we need to calculate the area of each sheet of dried fruit and then find the average of these areas.

For Berthe's sheet:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{Berthe}} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 24 \, \text{cm} \times 14 \, \text{cm} = 336 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

For Marcelle's sheet:
\[ \text{Area}_{\text{Marcelle}} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 3 \, \text{cm} \times 14 \, \text{cm} = 42 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Now, we find the average area:
\[ \text{Average Area} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{Berthe}} + \text{Area}_{\text{Marcelle}}}{2} = \frac{336 \, \text{cm}^2 + 42 \, \text{cm}^2}{2} = \frac{378 \, \text{cm}^2}{2} = 189 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

If Jomaly's phone can store 1,800 photos, how many chickens can Jomaly see in the photos of the chicken farm?

Let's denote:
- \( J \) as the number of photos Jomaly can store on her phone.
- \( B \) as the number of photos Brittaney's phone can store.
- \( C \) as the number of chickens in the photo of the chicken farm.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( J = 6B \)

We need to find \( C \) given that \( J = 1800 \).

First, substitute \( J = 1800 \) into the first equation:

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 300 \) into the second equation:
\[ 300 = 50C \]

Question: Sasha noticed that wood chips are more expensive now than they were a few months ago, after she bought some of them. Since she has some wood chips left, she decided to sell them. She bought 10 sheets of 2 x 4 x 10 wood, each sheet for $10, and 5 sheets of 4 x 4 x 10 wood, each sheet for $16. If she sells all the wood chips, how much profit will she make?

Answer: To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue from selling the wood chips.

Total cost:
- Cost of 10 sheets of 2 x 4 x 10 wood: 10 sheets * $10/sheet = $100
- Cost of 5 sheets of 4 x 4 x 10 wood: 5 sheets * $16/sheet = $80
- Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Total revenue:
- Selling price of 10 sheets of 2 x 4 x 10 wood: 10 sheets * $10/sheet = $100
- Selling price of 5 sheets of 4 x 4 x 10 wood: 5 sheets * $16/sheet = $80
- Total revenue: $100 + $80 = $180

On the second day, more crates were brought in, and the total number of vehicles in the port became 30. How many crates were brought in on the second day if each crate contains 5 vehicles?

Answer: Let's denote the number of crates brought in on the second day as \( x \). Each crate contains 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles brought in on the second day is \( 5x \). The total number of vehicles in the port after the second day is the sum of the vehicles from the first day and the vehicles brought in on the second day, which is given as 30. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 5 + 5x = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

From the problem, we know:
1. $E > L$ (Ed's salary is more than Lila's)
2. After four years, Ed's salary increased by 40% compared to his previous salary, which was $40,000.
3. Ed's salary increased by 40% compared to Lila's salary as well.

First, calculate Ed's current salary:
\[ E = 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

Next, calculate Lila's current salary:
\[ L = 40,000 \times (1 - 0.40) = 40,000 \times 0.60 = 24,000 \]

Now, calculate Ed's salary after four years:
\[ E_{\text{new}} = 56,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 56,000 \times 1.40 = 78,400 \]

And Lila's salary after four years:

Finally, calculate the total salary of both Ed and Lila after four years:
\[ \text{Total} = E_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 78,400 + 33,600 = 112,000 \]

A farmer sells rice to a trader at $20 per basket. The cost to transport one basket from the farm to the warehouse is $2. The trader makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the baskets at $30 each. How many baskets did the trader sell?

To solve this, let's break it down:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of baskets sold.
2. The revenue from selling \( x \) baskets at $30 each is \( 30x \).
3. The cost to transport \( x \) baskets from the farm to the warehouse is \( 2x \).
4. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is given as $400. So, we have the equation:

First, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes, since John's collection rate is given in cherries per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cherries collected by multiplying the number of minutes by the rate of cherries collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 cherries/minute = 360 cherries

Therefore, the answer is 360 cherries.",360,360

Cost of a pen with one barrel = Cost of a pencil + Cost of a rubber
Cost of a pen with one barrel = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen with one barrel = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 barrels of pens, we multiply the cost of one pen with one barrel by 8:

Cost of 8 barrels of pens = Cost of one pen with one barrel × 8

Question: Brinley is in the mathematics class of Mr. Bert. Mr. Bert will give six tests each semester, allowing students to drop the lowest score from their average. If Brinley got 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 points in the first five tests, what score must she get on the sixth test to have an average of 93 points?

Answer: To find the score Brinley must get on the sixth test to have an average of 93 points, we first need to calculate the total points she needs to achieve an average of 93 over six tests. 

The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]

Given that the average should be 93 and there are six tests, we can set up the equation:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{6} \]

Multiplying both sides by 6 to solve for the sum of all scores:
\[ 93 \times 6 = \text{Sum of all scores} \]
\[ 558 = \text{Sum of all scores} \]

Now, we know the sum of the first five scores is:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448 \]

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score on the sixth test} = 558 - 448 \]
\[ \text{Score on the sixth test} = 110 \]

Therefore, Brinley must get a score of $110$ on the sixth test to have an average of $93$ points.",93,98

If Sarah has $10 saved up before she starts taking care of the children, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to be able to buy the jacket and shoes?

To answer this, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes, and then determine how many times Sarah needs to mow the lawn to earn enough money to cover that cost.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is:
- Jacket: $30
- Two pairs of shoes: $20 x 2 = $40
- Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sarah earns $5 per child and has 4 children to take care of each day, so she earns:

Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her parents' contribution per day is:
- Parents' contribution: $4

Therefore, her total daily earnings from taking care of the children and mowing the lawn are:
- Total daily earnings: $20 + $4 = $24

To find out how many days she needs to mow the lawn to earn $70, we divide the total cost by her daily earnings:
- Number of days: $70 / $24 = 2.9167

Since Sarah can't mow the lawn a fraction of a day, she needs to round up to the next whole number:

Question: Jerry has two swimming pools. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool. Now, the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool. How much water is in the smaller pool now?

Answer: Let's denote the current amount of water in the smaller pool as \( x \) gallons. Since the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool, the current amount of water in the larger pool is \( 4x \) gallons.

The larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool four minutes ago, so four minutes ago, the amount of water in the larger pool was \( 2x \) gallons, and the amount of water in the smaller pool was \( x \) gallons.

The larger pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so in four minutes, it has leaked \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the larger pool is \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

Since the larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x - 4x = 16 \]
\[ -2x = 16 \]
\[ x = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool four minutes ago, so the current amount of water in the larger pool is \( 2x + 16 \) gallons.

Now, the current amount of water in the larger pool is \( 4x \) gallons, so we have:
\[ 2x + 16 = 4x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x - 4x = -16 \]
\[ -2x = -16 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the current amount of water in the smaller pool is \( x = 8 \) gallons.",8,8

   - \( N \) for Naomi
   - \( Y \) for Yuri
   - \( B \) for Barbara
   - \( J \) for Joey

2. We know the total score is 251 points:
   \[
   N + Y + B + J = 251
   \]

3. Naomi's score is 68 points:
   \[
   N = 68
   \]

4. Yuri's score is 10 points more than half of Naomi's score:
   \[
   Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

5. Barbara's score is 17 points more than Naomi's score:
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

6. Now, we can find Joey's score by substituting the known values into the total score equation:
   \[
   N + Y + B + J = 251
   \]
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Therefore, Joey's score is 54 points.",54,54

Carmen takes 10 minutes to solve a word puzzle and 5 minutes to solve a Sudoku puzzle. During the week, she solves 3 word puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles. How much time did she spend solving these puzzles?

To answer this, we calculate the total time spent on word puzzles and Sudoku puzzles separately and then sum them up.

1. Time spent on word puzzles:
   - 10 minutes per puzzle
   - 3 puzzles
   - Total time = 10 minutes/puzzle × 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

2. Time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
   - 5 minutes per puzzle
   - 8 puzzles
   - Total time = 5 minutes/puzzle × 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

3. Total time spent:
   - Word puzzles: 30 minutes
   - Sudoku puzzles: 40 minutes
   - Total time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Therefore, the answer is 70 minutes.",70,70

Let's denote the number of Pityum trees planted by Andy as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of Pityum trees is less than 40, so \( x < 40 \). The total number of trees Andy planted is the sum of the Juniper trees and the Pityum trees, which is \( 90 + x \).

Since \( x \) is less than 40, the maximum value for \( x \) is 39. Therefore, the maximum total number of trees Andy could have planted is \( 90 + 39 = 129 \).

To find the minimum total number of trees Andy could have planted, we need to consider the smallest possible value for \( x \), which is 1. Therefore, the minimum total number of trees Andy could have planted is \( 90 + 1 = 91 \).

Since \( x \) can take any value from 1 to 39, the total number of trees Andy planted can range from 91 to 129. The possible total numbers of trees Andy could have planted are all the integers from 91 to 129, inclusive.

To find the total number of possible values, we calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values and add 1:

If he loses 8 cards of Water type and buys 14 cards of Grass type, what is the probability that he will randomly draw a Water type card (rounded to the nearest whole number)?

To find the probability, we need to calculate the total number of cards and the number of Water type cards left after the changes.

Total number of cards = 30 (Fire) + 20 (Grass) + 40 (Water) = 90 cards

Number of Water type cards left = 40 - 8 + 14 = 46 cards

Probability of drawing a Water type card = Number of Water type cards left / Total number of cards
= 46 / 90

Now, let's calculate this probability:

Probability = 46 / 90 = 23 / 45

The probability that James will randomly draw a Water type card is $23/45$ or approximately 0.5111 (rounded to four decimal places).",5111,33

To find the answer, we need to calculate how many puzzles each of them can make per minute and then determine how long it will take for them to complete the set together.

1. Calinda's rate: 4 puzzles per minute
2. Her mother's rate: 4 puzzles per minute * 1.5 = 6 puzzles per minute

Combined rate: 4 puzzles per minute + 6 puzzles per minute = 10 puzzles per minute

Total puzzles: 360

Time to complete: Total puzzles / Combined rate = 360 / 10 = 36 minutes

Convert minutes to hours: 36 minutes / 60 = 0.6 hours

Let's break down the solution:

Let's break down the problem:

1. On Monday, Casey collected 5 more shells than Robert.
2. On Tuesday, Casey collected 2 times as many shells as she collected on Monday.

Let's denote the number of shells Robert collected on Monday as \( R \).

From the first piece of information, we have:
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Monday} = R + 5 \]

From the second piece of information, we have:
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2 \times (\text{Number of shells Casey collected on Monday}) \]
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2 \times (R + 5) \]

Now, let's calculate the number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2 \times (R + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2R + 10 \]

Since we know that on Tuesday Casey collected 5 more shells than Robert, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2R + 10 = R + 5 + 5 \]
\[ 2R + 10 = R + 10 \]

Now, let's solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 10 = R + 10 \]
\[ 2R - R = 10 - 10 \]
\[ R = 0 \]

This result seems incorrect because it implies Robert collected 0 shells, which contradicts the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Since Casey collected 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, and we need to find the number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday, we should use the correct equation:
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2 \times (\text{Number of shells Casey collected on Monday}) \]
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2 \times (R + 5) \]

Let's correct the calculation:
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2 \times (R + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2R + 10 \]

Since we know that on Tuesday Casey collected 5 more shells than Robert, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2R + 10 = R + 5 + 5 \]
\[ 2R + 10 = R + 10 \]

Now, let's solve for \( R \):
\[ 2R + 10 = R + 10 \]
\[ 2R - R = 10 - 10 \]
\[ R = 5 \]

Now that we have \( R = 5 \), we can find the number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2R + 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 2 \times 5 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 10 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of shells Casey collected on Tuesday} = 20 \]

Steve decided to eat more carrots and decided to grow his own carrots. He eats twice as many carrots as his girlfriend eats per day. He eats 6 carrots a day. If one carrot plant produces 3 carrots per week, how many plants does he need to grow?

To answer this question, we need to determine how many carrot plants are required to produce enough carrots for Steve to eat twice as many as his girlfriend eats per day.

1. First, we calculate the number of carrots Steve eats per day:
   \[
   \text{Steve's daily consumption} = 6 \text{ carrots}
   \]

2. Since Steve eats twice as many carrots as his girlfriend, we calculate the number of carrots his girlfriend eats per day:
   \[
   \text{Girlfriend's daily consumption} = \frac{6 \text{ carrots}}{2} = 3 \text{ carrots}
   \]

3. Now, we calculate the total number of carrots Steve needs per day:
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = 6 \text{ carrots} + 3 \text{ carrots} = 9 \text{ carrots}
   \]

4. We know that one carrot plant produces 3 carrots per week. To find out how many plants are needed to produce 9 carrots per day, we first calculate the number of carrots needed per week:
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 9 \text{ carrots/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ carrots/week}
   \]

5. Since one plant produces 3 carrots per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the weekly production of one plant to find the number of plants needed:
   \[
   \text{Number of plants needed} = \frac{63 \text{ carrots/week}}{3 \text{ carrots/plant/week}} = 21 \text{ plants}

Therefore, Steve needs to grow $21$ carrot plants.",21,21

Joe decided to try to fix the house to sell it for a profit. He bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 fixing it up. The repair work increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total cost of the house after the repair, subtract the original purchase price, and then find the difference between the total cost and the original purchase price to determine the profit.

1. The original purchase price of the house is $80,000.

3. The increase in value due to the repair is 150% of the original purchase price, which is $80,000 * 150% = $120,000.
4. The total cost of the house after the repair is the sum of the original purchase price and the repair cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
5. The profit is the total cost after the repair minus the original purchase price: $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000.

Given that the book was sold for $19.50, which is 25% cheaper than the original price, we can express this relationship as:

This simplifies to:

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

Solving for $x$:

\[ 8.50x = 50 - 66 \]
\[ 8.50x = -16 \]

Glória is choosing to buy a pair of shoes and finds a pair of boots that match her budget. However, she has to choose between the high heels and two pairs of sneakers that together cost more than the price of the boots. If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other is twice as expensive, how much does the pair of boots cost?

To answer this question, we first need to calculate the total cost of the two high heels. Since one pair costs $33 and the other is twice as expensive, the total cost for the two high heels is:

$33 + 2 * $33 = $33 + $66 = $99

Now, we know that the total cost of the two high heels is more than the price of the boots. Therefore, the price of the boots must be less than $99. Since the question asks for the price of the boots, and we know that the two high heels together cost more than the boots, the price of the boots must be less than $99. However, we cannot determine the exact price of the boots without additional information. Therefore, the answer is that the boots cost less than $99.",99,104

Question: The age difference between Darrel and Alan is in the ratio 7:11. If the sum of their current ages is 162 years, calculate Alan's age 10 years from now.

Answer: Let's denote Darrel's current age as \(7x\) and Alan's current age as \(11x\). According to the problem, their combined age is 162 years:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

\[18x = 162\]

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

So, Darrel's current age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) years, and Alan's current age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\) years.

In 10 years, Alan's age will be \(99 + 10 = 109\) years.

To find out how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we need to calculate the total time spent on each dog and then multiply by the number of dogs.

First, let's find the total time spent on one dog in a week:

\[ \text{Time per dog per week} = 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \]

Gretchen has 110 coins, with more gold coins than silver coins by 30 coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

Let's denote:
- \( G \) as the number of gold coins.
- \( S \) as the number of silver coins.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

He then bought 8 video games at $20 each. Therefore, the total amount of money he spent on the video games is:

After buying the video games, John had $5 left. Therefore, the total amount of money he had before buying the video games is:

\[ \$195 + \$5 = \$200 \]

Since he spent $160 on video games, the amount of money he had before buying the video games is:

\[ \$200 - \$160 = \$40 \]

Since he had $40 before buying the video games, and he had 13 sets of Lego toys, the number of Lego sets he still has is:

To answer this question, we need to calculate the distance covered in each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Walking Speed**: Since she can walk at half the speed she runs, her walking speed is:
   \[
   \text{Walking Speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Running Speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}

2. **Distance Covered by Walking**: In six hours, the distance covered by walking is:
   \[
   \text{Distance by Walking} = \text{Walking Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ miles}

3. **Distance Covered by Running**: In the remaining two-thirds of the time, she runs at her full speed:
   \[

mgsm-th-41,"Question: Perik the Dragon Slayer stands on the peak of the Farbo Mountain. He can ignite everything within a range of 1000 feet. Pollie can throw the golden sword, the only weapon she knows that can defeat a dragon, 400 feet away. This sword is within the dragon's range of fire, but when Pollie holds the pearl, she can throw the sword three times as far as when she doesn't hold it. If she holds the pearl, how far will Pollie be from the dragon's fire range while still throwing the golden sword at the dragon?

Answer: Let's denote the distance Pollie can throw the sword without holding the pearl as \( d \) feet. According to the problem, holding the pearl allows her to throw the sword three times as far, so the distance she can throw the sword with the pearl is \( 3d \) feet.

The dragon's fire range is 1000 feet, and Pollie is standing on the peak of the Farbo Mountain, which means she is at the highest point of the mountain. The distance from the peak of the mountain to the dragon's fire range is the same as the distance from the peak to the point where the dragon's fire range ends, which is 1000 feet.

When Pollie holds the pearl, she can throw the sword three times as far as without holding the pearl, so the distance from the peak of the mountain to the point where the dragon's fire range ends is \( 3d \) feet. This means that the distance from the peak of the mountain to the point where the dragon's fire range ends is \( 3d \) feet, which is the same as the distance from the peak to the point where the dragon's fire range ends.

Therefore, the distance Pollie is from the dragon's fire range when she holds the pearl is \( 3d \) feet. Since the dragon's fire range is 1000 feet, we have \( 3d = 1000 \). Solving for \( d \), we get \( d = \frac{1000}{3} \) feet.

When Pollie throws the sword without holding the pearl, the distance she can throw the sword is \( d \) feet. Therefore, the distance Pollie is from the dragon's fire range when she throws the sword without holding the pearl is \( d \) feet.

Since \( d = \frac{1000}{3} \) feet, the distance Pollie is from the dragon's fire range when she throws the sword without holding the pearl is \( \frac{1000}{3} \) feet.

The final answer is \( \boxed{\frac{1000}{3}} \) feet.",3,200

Last week, she wrote 5 posts on Monday, and wrote more than Monday by 2/5 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many posts as she did on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing blog posts over the three days.

**Answer:**
Let's denote the number of hours Meredith spent writing on Tuesday as \( x \).

- On Monday, she wrote 5 posts, so the total time spent on Monday is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) hours.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( x \) hours, so the total time spent on Tuesday is \( x \) hours.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many posts as on Tuesday, so she wrote \( 2x \) posts. The total time spent on Wednesday is \( 2x \) hours.

The total time spent writing over the three days is:
\[ 20 + x + 2x = 20 + 3x \]

We know that the total time spent writing is 4 hours per post, and she wrote 5 posts on Monday, so the total time spent on Monday is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) hours. Therefore, the total time spent writing over the three days is:
\[ 20 + 3x = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0 \]

So, Meredith spent 0 hours writing on Tuesday.

The total time spent writing over the three days is:

In a school building, there are 1,000 students in a hall. The hall has three exits: A, B, and C, which are used as exit points. After the meeting, 30% of the students exit the building using exit A. The remaining students are 3/5 using exit B, and the rest using exit C. Calculate the number of students who exit the hall using exit C.

To answer this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of students using exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Students using exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after those using exit A:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700

To find out how many more minutes of calls John will have left, we first need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends on business calls in a month. Since he spends 15 minutes each day on business calls, we can calculate the total number of minutes spent on business calls in a month as follows:

\[ \text{Total minutes on business calls} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Since John's phone plan allows him to make calls for 1,000 minutes per month, we can now calculate the number of minutes he will have left after spending 450 minutes on business calls:

To calculate the total cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked per week.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked over the duration of the movie shoot.
3. Calculate the total cost before the reduction.
4. Calculate the reduction in cost due to the 10% discount.

The total amount of food given in the morning is $15F$ and in the afternoon is $25F$. Therefore, the total amount of food given in a day is $15F + 25F = 40F$.

Since $F = 3$, the total amount of food given in a day is $40 \times 3 = 120$ buckets.

Since she feeds the chickens three times a day, the amount of food given in the evening is $120 / 3 = 40$ buckets.

Normally, she can download a file at a rate of 2 GB per minute, but after downloading for 40% of the time, Windows prompts her to restart and install updates, which take 20 minutes. How long does it take for Karl to download the entire file?

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial download and the restart and update process.

1. **Initial Download:**
   - The total file size is 200 GB.
   - Normally, Karl can download 2 GB per minute.
   - So, the initial download time is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

To answer this, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the trees, and then determine how many years it will take for the revenue from selling lemons to cover this cost.

1. **Initial investment:**
   - Cost per tree: $90
   - Number of trees: 1 (since the question doesn't specify the number of trees, we assume it's just one tree)
   - Total initial investment: $90

2. **Annual maintenance cost:**
   - Cost per tree: $3
   - Number of trees: 1
   - Total annual maintenance cost: $3

3. **Annual revenue from selling lemons:**
   - Yield per tree: 7 lemons per year
   - Price per lemon: $1.5
   - Total annual revenue: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

She sells half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in yellow homes. If Melany has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have initially?

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melany initially had as \( N \).

1. She sells one-third of the vacuum cleaners in green homes, so she sells \( \frac{N}{3} \) vacuum cleaners in green homes.
2. She sells an additional 2 vacuum cleaners in red homes, so she sells \( 2 \) vacuum cleaners in red homes.
3. After selling in green and red homes, she has \( N - \frac{N}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sells half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in yellow homes, so she sells \( \frac{1}{2} \left( N - \frac{N}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners in yellow homes.
5. After selling in yellow homes, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   N - \frac{N}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( N - \frac{N}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   N - \frac{N}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( N - \frac{N}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

2. Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   N - \frac{N}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2}N + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{N}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
   \]

3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   N - \frac{N}{3} - \frac{1}{2}N + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{N}{3} - 2 + 1 = 5
   \]

4. Simplify further:
   \[
   N - \frac{N}{3} - \frac{1}{2}N + \frac{1}{6}N - 1 = 5
   \]

5. Combine the \(N\) terms:
   \[
   N - \frac{N}{3} - \frac{1}{2}N + \frac{1}{6}N = 5 + 1

6. Simplify the \(N\) terms:
   \[
   N - \frac{2}{6}N - \frac{3}{6}N + \frac{1}{6}N = 6

7. Combine the fractions:
   \[
   N - \frac{4}{6}N = 6
   \]

8. Simplify the fractions:

   N - \frac{2}{3}N = 6

1. Calculate the total earnings from teaching:
   - She teaches 35 hours per week.
   - She works 50 weeks in a year.
   - Her hourly rate for teaching is $20.
   - Total teaching hours in a year = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year.
   - Total earnings from teaching = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year.

2. Calculate the total earnings from coaching:
   - She coaches 15 hours per week.
   - She works 50 weeks in a year.
   - Her hourly rate for coaching is $30.
   - Total coaching hours in a year = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year.
   - Total earnings from coaching = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year.

3. Calculate the total earnings for the year:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
   - Total earnings = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500/year.

Therefore, the answer is $57,500.",500,57500
polymath-low-th-18,"Calorie makes 3 egg rolls for breakfast every day. In 4 weeks, how many eggs will she eat?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of egg rolls made in 4 weeks and then multiply by the number of eggs per roll.

First, let's find out how many days are in 4 weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of egg rolls made in 28 days:
\[ 28 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ egg rolls/day} = 84 \text{ egg rolls} \]

Since each egg roll contains 1 egg, the total number of eggs she will eat is:

polymath-low-th-20,"Sure, let's break down the problem and translate it into English.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Watermelon juice: 10 liters
   - Water content in watermelon juice: 2/3
   - Mango juice: 15 liters
   - Water content in mango juice: 3/5

2. **Process:**
   - Add 1 liter of watermelon juice to the mango juice.
   - The total volume of the mixture will be the sum of the initial volumes of both juices plus the additional 1 liter of watermelon juice.

3. **Final Volume:**
   - The total volume of the mixture will be 10 liters (watermelon juice) + 15 liters (mango juice) + 1 liter (additional watermelon juice) = 26 liters.

4. **Final Water Content:**
   - The water content in the final mixture will be the sum of the water content in both juices and the additional watermelon juice.
   - Water content in watermelon juice: 2/3 * 10 liters = 20/3 liters
   - Water content in mango juice: 3/5 * 15 liters = 9 liters
   - Additional watermelon juice: 1 liter
   - Total water content: 20/3 + 9 + 1 = 20/3 + 12/3 + 3/3 = 35/3 liters

5. **Remaining Volume:**
   - The remaining volume of the mixture will be the total volume minus the total water content.
   - Remaining volume: 26 liters - 35/3 liters = 78/3 liters - 35/3 liters = 43/3 liters

### English Translation:
""Initially, I have 10 liters of watermelon juice with 2/3 water content. I also have 15 liters of mango juice with 3/5 water content. I add 1 liter of watermelon juice to the mango juice. After mixing, the total volume of the mixture will be 10 liters (watermelon juice) + 15 liters (mango juice) + 1 liter (additional watermelon juice) = 26 liters. The total water content in the mixture will be 20/3 liters (watermelon juice) + 9 liters (mango juice) + 1 liter (additional watermelon juice) = 35/3 liters. The remaining volume of the mixture will be 26 liters - 35/3 liters = 43/3 liters.""

polymath-low-th-21,"Question: Raymond and Samantha are siblings. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. When Raymond was 23 years old, he had a son. If Samantha is currently 31 years old, how many years ago did Raymond's son was born?

Answer: Let's denote the current age of Samantha as \( S \) and the current age of Raymond as \( R \). According to the problem, \( S = 31 \) and \( R = 23 \). Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we have \( R = S - 6 \). Substituting the values, we get \( 23 = 31 - 6 \), which is true. Now, let's find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. If Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond was 23 years old when he had a son, then the son was born \( 31 - 23 = 8 \) years ago. Therefore, the answer is 8.",8,14

Bill sells DVDs on Monday. He has 8 customers on Monday. The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, the next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, and the last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Bill sell on Monday?

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we calculate the sum of the DVDs sold by each group of customers:

- The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is:

\[3 + 4 + 0 = 7\]

""One candlestick burns down at a rate of 2 cm per hour. If the candlestick starts at 13:00 and ends at 17:00, how much will it have shortened?""

To answer this, we need to calculate the total time the candlestick burns and then multiply that by the rate at which it burns down.

The candlestick burns from 13:00 to 17:00, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate of burning is 2 cm per hour.

So, the total decrease in length of the candlestick is:

polymath-low-th-24,"The question in English is:

Clare bought a best-selling book from last year for $19.50, which is a 25% reduction from the original price. What was the original price of the book?

To answer this, we can set up the following equation:

Let the original price of the book be \( P \).

The price after a 25% reduction is 75% of the original price, which is given as $19.50. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.",0,26
polymath-low-th-25,"The question in English is: Mary orders a chicken dish priced at $12 per pack, 5 packs, and each pack contains $3 apples, 4 apples per pack, and each apple costs $1.50. She also orders a pizza priced at $8.50 per tray. Mary pays a total of $50. How many trays of pizza did Mary order?

Let's break down the cost of the chicken dish:
- Chicken dish: $12 per pack
- Number of packs: 5
- Total cost of chicken dish: $12 * 5 = $60

Now, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
- Apples per pack: 4
- Cost per apple: $1.50
- Total cost of apples: $1.50 * 4 * 5 = $30

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken dish and the apples:
- Total cost of chicken dish and apples: $60 + $30 = $90

Mary pays a total of $50, so the remaining amount for the pizza is:
- Remaining amount: $50 - $90 = -$40

Since the remaining amount is negative, it means Mary did not have enough money to order the pizza. Therefore, Mary did not order any trays of pizza.

The answer is: $0$ trays of pizza.",0,2

polymath-low-th-29,"The question is in Thai, and it asks about the price of shoes. Let's break it down:

1. Glória is choosing between buying a pair of shoes and a pair of high heels that match her budget.
2. However, she has to choose between high heels and two pairs of sneakers that cost more than the high heels.
3. One pair of sneakers costs $33.
4. Another pair of sneakers costs twice as much as the first pair.

To find the price of the high heels, we need to calculate the cost of the two pairs of sneakers and then subtract that from Glória's budget.

Let's calculate the total cost of the two pairs of sneakers:

1. The first pair costs $33.
2. The second pair costs twice as much, so it costs $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add the costs of the two pairs of sneakers:

$33 + $66 = $99

Glória's budget for shoes is $99. Therefore, the high heels cost $99.

polymath-low-th-30,"The question is already in English. Let's solve it step by step.

1. Let's denote the current age of Darrel as \( D \) and the current age of Alan as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write:
   \[
   \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
3. The problem also states that the sum of their current ages is 162 years:
   \[
   D + A = 162
   \]
4. From the ratio, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11}A
   \]
5. Substitute this expression for \( D \) into the sum equation:
   \[
   \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162
   \]
6. Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162
   \]
   \[
   \frac{18A}{11} = 162
   \]
7. Solve for \( A \):
   \[
   18A = 162 \times 11
   \]
   \[
   18A = 1782
   \]
   \[
   A = \frac{1782}{18}
   \]
   \[
   A = 99
   \]
8. Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11} \times 99
   \]
   \[
   D = 7 \times 9
   \]
   \[
   D = 63
   \]
9. The problem asks for Alan's age in 10 years. So, Alan's age in 10 years will be:
   \[
   A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, the answer is 109.",109,109
