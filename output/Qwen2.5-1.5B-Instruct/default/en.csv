mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of units occupied by Richard.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate 3/4 of 120:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

This means that 90 units are occupied. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the total number of eggs produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs per week.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs are in 1764 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, the total revenue per week is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount Lloyd makes on eggs per week is:

mgsm-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back to his starting point, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel from 4 PM to 1 PM at a speed of 6 mph. 

First, we calculate the distance between 1 PM and 4 PM. Since the time difference is 3 hours, and Tom's speed is 6 mph, the distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to travel this distance at 6 mph. The time taken is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom 3 hours to travel back to his starting point. The final answer is:

mgsm-en-52,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
   - Uriah removes 30 comic books.
   - Total weight of comic books = \( 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \) pounds.

2. **Determine the remaining weight after removing the comic books:**
   - Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total.
   - After removing 7.5 pounds from the comic books, the remaining weight is \( 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate the weight of each toy:**
   - Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.

4. **Determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to reach the remaining weight:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of toys.
   - Total weight of toys = \( x \times \frac{1}{2} \).
   - We need \( x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \).

mgsm-en-53,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and repaired 6 truck tires.
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire and repaired 4 car tires.

The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is:
\[ 6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360 \]

The revenue from car tires on Thursday is:
\[ 4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160 \]

The total revenue for Thursday is:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and did not repair any truck tires.
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire and repaired 12 car tires.

The revenue from truck tires on Friday is:
\[ 0 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$0 \]

The revenue from car tires on Friday is:
\[ 12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480 \]

The total revenue for Friday is:
\[ \$0 + \$480 = \$480 \]

Now, we compare the revenues from both days:
- Revenue on Thursday: \$520
- Revenue on Friday: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday.",40,40
mgsm-en-54,"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of adopted kittens Patchy has.
2. Identify the number of adopted kittens Trixie has.
3. Add the number of adopted kittens Patchy and Trixie have to the number of adopted kittens they originally had.

First, we know that Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens as the adopted kittens from the local animal shelter. Since the local animal shelter had 7 adopted kittens, Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) adopted kittens.

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens.

The original number of adopted kittens the Doubtfire family had is not specified, but we can assume it is 0 since no other information is given. Therefore, the total number of adopted kittens is the sum of the adopted kittens from the local animal shelter and the adopted kittens from Patchy and Trixie.

So, the total number of adopted kittens is \(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\).

Since no other information is given about the original number of adopted kittens, we can assume that the total number of adopted kittens is 40. Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is \(40 + 7 = 47\).

mgsm-en-57,"Let's denote the number of boxes by \( n \). Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight of the boxes is \( 15n \) pounds. The total weight of the truck, including the driver and the empty truck, is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the driver is \( 3755 - 15n \) pounds. However, we don't need to know the driver's weight to solve the problem, so we can focus on the weight of the boxes.

The total weight of the truck and the boxes must not exceed 5000 pounds. Therefore, we have the inequality:
\[ 15n + 3755 \leq 5000. \]

To find the maximum number of boxes, we solve for \( n \):
\[ 15n \leq 5000 - 3755, \]
\[ 15n \leq 1245, \]
\[ n \leq \frac{1245}{15}, \]
\[ n \leq 83. \]

1. **Calculate the delivery fee:**
   The delivery fee is $3.00.

2. **Calculate the total before the tip:**
   The total before the tip is the sum of the final bill, the delivery fee, and the tip.
   \[
   \text{Total before tip} = \text{Final bill} + \text{Delivery fee} + \text{Tip}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:

3. **Calculate the total after the 25% fee:**
   The 25% fee is applied to the total before the tip.
   \[
   \text{Fee} = 0.25 \times \text{Total before tip}

1. Calculate the total miles Sophia has driven since the last fill-up.
2. Determine the total miles she can drive on a full tank of gas.
3. Calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car.
4. Use the mpg to find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas.

Step 1: Sophia has driven 100 miles since the last fill-up.

Step 2: The owner's manual says her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already driven 100 miles on 4 gallons, we can calculate the total miles she can drive on a full tank of gas by setting up a proportion:

\[
\frac{4 \text{ gallons}}{100 \text{ miles}} = \frac{12 \text{ gallons}}{x \text{ miles}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{12 \text{ gallons} \times 100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas.

Step 3: To find the miles per gallon (mpg), we use the information that she drove 100 miles on 4 gallons:

\[
\text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
\]

Step 4: Now that we know her car's mpg, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas:

mgsm-en-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both package sizes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The savings is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price. The final answer is:

mgsm-en-85,"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on.
2. Determine the number of blocks for each year of vacations.
3. Sum the total number of blocks.

First, we calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. Since he has been on four vacations a year and he has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, we can find the total number of vacations by multiplying the number of vacations per year by the number of years he has been vacationing.

\[
\text{Total number of vacations} = 4 \text{ vacations/year} \times (34 - 23) \text{ years} = 4 \times 11 = 44 \text{ vacations}
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of blocks for each year of vacations. Since each year has a different number of blocks, we need to know the number of blocks for each year. However, the problem does not specify the number of blocks per year, so we assume that the number of blocks per year is a constant value for each year. Let's denote the number of blocks per year as \( b \).

The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from each year. Since there are 44 years and each year has \( b \) blocks, the total number of blocks is:

\[
\text{Total number of blocks} = 44 \times b
\]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( b \), we cannot calculate a specific numerical answer without additional information. However, if we assume that the number of blocks per year is a constant value, the total number of blocks is simply the product of the number of years and the number of blocks per year.

Given the problem's context and the lack of specific values, the answer in terms of the number of blocks per year \( b \) is:

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}

- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[

2. \( A = C - 2 \)
3. \( I = C - 1 \)

Now that we know Corey is 11 years old, we can use the second piece of information to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Finally, we can use the first piece of information to find Jackson's age:

However, he dropped 5 cookies, so the actual number of cookies he had was \( 2x - 5 \). We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

Since the number of cookies must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem to ensure there are no calculation or interpretation errors. However, the problem states that Henry actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, which means the equation should be:

\[ 2x - 5 = 110 + 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 2x - 5 = 125 \]

Now, we add 5 to both sides:

mgsm-en-110,"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- His roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both of them:
- The total number of roll-ups eaten is \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each of them, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:

mgsm-en-115,"To calculate the profit Sasha makes, we first need to determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and then subtract this from the total revenue she generates from selling the lumber.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**
   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Each board costs $10.
     - Total cost for ten boards = $10 * 10 = $100.
   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Each board costs $16.
     - Total cost for five boards = $16 * 5 = $80.
   - Total cost of all lumber = $100 + $80 = $180.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:**
   - Sasha sells all the boards.
   - Total number of boards = 10 (2 x 4 x 10) + 5 (4 x 4 x 10) = 15 boards.
   - Selling price per board = $100 (since the cost is $10 each and she sells them all).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Total revenue = Selling price per board * Total number of boards = $100 * 15 = $1500.

4. **Calculate the profit:**

mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar by \( S \) and the number of cups of water by \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ S : W = 7 : 13 \]

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Since the ratio \( S : W = 7 : 13 \), we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ W = \frac{13}{7}S \]

Now, substitute \( W \) in the total amount equation:
\[ S + \frac{13}{7}S = 120 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7S}{7} + \frac{13S}{7} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20S}{7} = 120 \]

To solve for \( S \), multiply both sides by 7:
\[ 20S = 840 \]

Now, divide both sides by 20:
\[ S = \frac{840}{20} \]
\[ S = 42 \]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]",42,42

According to the problem, there were 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

After the first day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is the difference between the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day and the number of vehicles at the port after the first day. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4

\[ A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]

We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so:

\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]

\[ L = 30769.23 \]

Now, we know that four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40%, so his new salary is:

\[ A_{\text{new}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A \]

Substituting \( A = 40000 \):

\[ A_{\text{new}} = 1.4 \times 40000 \]

\[ A_{\text{new}} = 56000 \]

Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later is also $56000. Therefore, the total salary they were receiving four years later is:

\[ \text{Total} = A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} \]

\[ \text{Total} = 56000 + 56000 \]

\[ \text{Total} = 112000 \]

So, the total number of fruits Morisette brought is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits} \]

Next, let's determine the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples that Morisette brought. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples} \]
- Kael brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is:

   Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Eggs eaten for breakfast:**
   Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
   \[
   \text{Eggs eaten for breakfast} = 3
   \]

3. **Eggs used to bake muffins:**
   Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins every day.
   \[
   \text{Eggs used for muffins} = 4
   \]

4. **Eggs left for sale at the market:**
   Subtract the eggs eaten for breakfast and the eggs used for muffins from the total number of eggs laid.
   \[
   \text{Eggs left for sale} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9
   \]

5. **Revenue from selling the eggs at the market:**
   Janet sells each egg for $2.
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 9 \times 2 = 18
   \]

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. The final answer is:
\[

mgsm-en-4,"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon.
2. Subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available each day.
3. Divide the remaining amount of feed by the number of chickens to find out how much feed each chicken gets in the final meal.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal. Since Wendi gives 3 cups of feed to each chicken every day, we need to find out how many chickens there are. The problem does not specify the number of chickens, but we can assume that the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is the feed for all the chickens in the morning and afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed for all the chickens in the morning and afternoon is the same as the total amount of feed for all the chickens in the final meal.

Since the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, and this is the same as the total amount of feed for all the chickens in the final meal, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since the question asks for the amount of feed needed for the final meal, and we have already calculated that it is 40 cups, the answer is:

mgsm-en-5,"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and each subsequent glass costs 60% of the price of the previous glass.

Let's calculate the cost step by step:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 \times 0.60 = $3.
3. The cost of the third glass is 60% of $3, which is $3 \times 0.60 = $1.80.
4. The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of $1.80, which is $1.80 \times 0.60 = $1.08.
5. We can see that each subsequent glass costs 60% of the previous glass, so the cost of the \(n\)-th glass is \(5 \times (0.60)^{n-1}\).

To find the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to sum the costs of all 16 glasses. This is an infinite geometric series with the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.60\).

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

For \(n = 16\), the sum is:
\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{1 - 0.60} \]
\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{0.40} \]
\[ S_{16} = 5 \times \frac{1 - (0.60)^{16}}{0.40} \]
\[ S_{16} = 5 \times \frac{1 - 0.00053}{0.40} \]
\[ S_{16} = 5 \times \frac{0.99947}{0.40} \]
\[ S_{16} = 5 \times 2.498675 \]
\[ S_{16} = 12.493375 \]

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
   However, the problem states that the number of downloads in the second month was reduced by 30%. To find the actual number of downloads, we need to calculate 70% of 180 (since 100% - 30% = 70%):
   \[

First, let's calculate the net profit per year. The tree grows 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue from selling the lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, we need to account for the cost of watering and feeding the tree each year. The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year. Therefore, the net profit per year is:

\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

- The jewelry market will increase by 2.5%.
- The increase in value of the jewelry is calculated as \( 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \).

4. Calculate the speed needed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has spent hiking so far. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So, the total time spent so far is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time required to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]
Rearranging this formula to solve for total time, we get:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the remaining time Marissa needs to hike. Since she has already spent 2 hours and needs a total of 3 hours, the remaining time is:

Finally, we calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 4 miles in the remaining 1 hour. The formula for speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.",0,26
mgsm-en-25,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items and then find out how much was spent on the pizzas. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal:
   \[
   \text{Cost of chicken meal} = \$12
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost of the 5 packs of milk:
   \[
   \text{Cost of milk} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the 4 apples:
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 4 \times \$1.50 = \$6
   \]

4. Let the number of boxes of pizza be \( x \). The total cost of the pizzas is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pizzas} = x \times \$8.50 = \$8.50x
   \]

5. The total amount spent by Marie is the sum of the costs of the chicken meal, the milk, the apples, and the pizzas. We know this total is $50:
   \[
   \$12 + \$15 + \$6 + \$8.50x = \$50
   \]

6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   \$33 + \$8.50x = \$50
   \]

7. Isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting $33 from both sides:
   \[
   \$8.50x = \$50 - \$33
   \]
   \[
   \$8.50x = \$17
   \]

8. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by \$8.50:
   \[
   x = \frac{\$17}{\$8.50} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza.",2,2

First, we calculate the cost of the shorts:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the shoes:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

1. Calculate the total number of servings of ice cream Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost of the ice cream.

First, we calculate the total number of servings of ice cream Cynthia will consume in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night and there are 60 nights in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy. Each carton contains 15 servings. Therefore, the number of cartons she will need is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip.
2. Determine the distance of the first stop.
3. Determine the distance of the second stop.
4. Calculate the distance between the first and second stops.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. The first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance to the first stop is 20 miles. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance to the second stop is 45 miles (since the total trip is 60 miles, and the second stop is 15 miles before the end, the distance to the second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles).

The distance between the first and second stops is the distance to the second stop minus the distance to the first stop:

\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. The cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is $104. The final answer is:

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:

\[ \text{Darrell's age} = 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63 \]
\[ \text{Allen's age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Next, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

3. Multiply that by the number of days in a week to find the total number of hours per week.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total number of hours spent per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends per week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the second equation:

mgsm-en-38,"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total time he spends running in a week and then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the time John spends running each day:
- The first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, each of these days he runs for \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we know John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} \]

mgsm-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate her running and walking speeds and then use these to find the total distance traveled.

First, we know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour. According to the problem, her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Dana spends one-third of her six-hour trip running and two-thirds of her trip walking. Therefore, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance traveled during the running and walking periods. The distance traveled while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance traveled while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.
3. Determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ W = 2B \]

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation, we get:

   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

2. **Return of Half the Departed Bees:**
   In the next 6 hours, she sees half as many bees return as those that left initially. Therefore, the number of bees that return is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

3. **Departure of Twice the Initial Departure:**
   In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees leave the hive as those that initially left. Therefore, the number of bees that leave is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Return of the Departed Bees:**
   In the next 6 hours, every bee that left before returning to the hive returns. Since 30 bees initially left and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours, the total number of bees that left is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90
   \]
   Therefore, the number of bees that returned is:
   \[
   90
   \]

Thus, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is \(\boxed{90}\).",90,75
mgsm-en-148,"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then find out how much change she received.

First, let's denote the cost of one child ticket as \( C \) and the cost of one adult ticket as \( A \). According to the problem, the cost of one child ticket is $10 and the cost of one adult ticket is $12. Therefore, we have:
\[ C = 10 \]
\[ A = 12 \]

Brittany's mom gave the cashier one child ticket and one adult ticket, so the total cost of these tickets is:
\[ C + A = 10 + 12 = 22 \]

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier. According to the problem, she received $8 in change, which means the amount of money she gave is $8 more than the total cost of the tickets. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 22 + 8 \]

Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 30 \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30

\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of Facebook friends James has by multiplying the number of friends Dorothy has by 4:
\[ \text{Number of Facebook friends James has} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has \( 16 \) Facebook friends.",16,16
mgsm-en-150,"To determine who will be waiting the longest, we need to calculate the time each person takes to travel from the school to their respective homes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to travel from the school to his home:
- Steve lives 3 miles away from the school.
- Steve's biking speed is 440 feet per minute.

We need to convert the distance from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we have:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Steve to travel 15840 feet at a speed of 440 feet per minute:
\[ \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to travel from the school to his home:
- Tim lives 2 miles away from the school.
- Tim's biking speed is 264 feet per minute.

We convert the distance from miles to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for Tim to travel 10560 feet at a speed of 264 feet per minute:
\[ \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be waiting longer than Tim. The difference in time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Steve will be waiting 4 minutes longer than Tim. The final answer is:

3. The seagull then gobbled down half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
4. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
5. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the remaining fries after the seagull and pigeons ate as \( y \). The number of fries stolen by the raccoon is \( \frac{2}{3}y \). The number of fries left after the raccoon stole some is \( y - \frac{2}{3}y = \frac{1}{3}y \).
6. Ants carried off one fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}y - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \]
\[ y = 18 \]

This means there were 18 fries left after the seagull, pigeons, and raccoon stole some. Since the seagull stole 7 fries, the number of fries before the seagull stole them was:

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on each type of day:

1. **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
   - Kimo has 3 classes each day.
   - Each class is 1 hour long.
   - Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
   - Kimo has 2 classes each day.
   - Each class is 2 hours long.
   - Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is:
     \[
     2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes each week:

\[
\text{Total hours per week} = (\text{hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays}) + (\text{hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays})
\]
\[
\text{Total hours per week} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} + 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Total hours per week} = 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes over the 16 weeks of the semester:

\[
\text{Total hours in one semester} = \text{Total hours per week} \times 16 \text{ weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total hours in one semester} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}

- Let \( D \) be the cost of one doll.

From the problem, we know:
1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car.
2. One red car costs $4.

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 3A + R \]
Since \( R = 4 \), we substitute \( R \) into the equation:

mgsm-en-173,"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate 50% of each minimum payment and then add that to the original minimum payment.

For the student loans:
50% of $300 = 0.50 * $300 = $150
So, the additional amount for the student loans is $150.

For the credit card:
50% of $200 = 0.50 * $200 = $100
So, the additional amount for the credit card is $100.

For the mortgage:
50% of $500 = 0.50 * $500 = $250
So, the additional amount for the mortgage is $250.

Now, we add the original minimum payments to the additional amounts to get the total amount Jessica pays each month:
Total monthly payment = Minimum payment + Additional amount
Total monthly payment = $300 + $150 + $200 + $100 + $500 + $250
Total monthly payment = $1600

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = Total monthly payment * 12
Total annual payment = $1600 * 12
Total annual payment = $19200

Therefore, the final answer is $19200.",19200,18000
mgsm-en-174,"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required for both peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the time to peel one potato into seconds:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add the time to cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

This is the time it takes to prepare one potato. To find the total time for 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by the number of potatoes:
\[ 95 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{5700 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Billy $95$ minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.",95,95
mgsm-en-175,"Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( g \). The cost for lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue from each gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = $10 \). The profit from each gallon is the revenue minus the cost, which is \( 10 - 5 = $5 \).

If they made a total profit of $25, the total number of gallons they made is \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons. Since each gallon requires $5 in costs, the total cost for lemons and sugar is \( 5 \times 5 = $25 \).

The cost for lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost for lemons is \( 5 \times 3 = $15 \).

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is \( \boxed{15} \).",15,15

4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife.
7. Find the final amount of money Zaid has left.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
   \]

4. **Donation to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250

6. **Amount given to daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age: \( M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2) + 5 \)

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old, so \( A = 30 \).

First, substitute \( A = 30 \) into the second equation:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2) + 5 \]

Since \( J = M + 2 \), we can substitute \( J \) in the equation:

\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}M + 5 \]

Now, solve for \( M \):

\[ \frac{1}{2}M = 7 \]
\[ M = 14 \]

mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities for both events and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
After rolling an even number, there are now 5 numbers left on the die. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{2}{5}
\]
Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3
\]
To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.3 \times 100 = 30\%

Since the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number, we conclude that \( r = 8 \) (as it is the whole number part of the division).

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week. He runs 3 days a week, and he runs for 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, he runs for:

\[ \text{Time on the first day} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time on the third day} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these times together gives the total time spent running each week:

\[ \text{Total time} = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the distances she covers while running and walking.

First, we know that Dana's skipping speed is half of her running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
and the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

The distance Dana can travel while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance Dana can travel while walking is:

polymath-low-en-41,"To determine how far Polly can stand outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin when she is not holding the gemstone.
2. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when she is holding the gemstone.
3. Calculate the distance outside the dragon's flames that Polly can still hit the dragon with the javelin.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet when she is not holding the gemstone. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when she is not holding the gemstone. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin when she is holding the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can still hit the dragon with the javelin, we subtract the dragon's flames reach from the distance she can throw the javelin when she is holding the gemstone:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly can still hit the dragon with the gold javelin is:

polymath-low-en-43,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many calories are in the bag of chips and then determine how many grams can be eaten based on the daily calorie target.

1. **Calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in the bag.
   - Total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine how many grams can be eaten based on the daily calorie target:**
   - The daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.
   - Since each serving has 250 calories, the number of servings you can eat with the remaining calories is 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.

3. **Calculate the grams of chips you can eat:**
   - Each serving is 300 grams.

polymath-low-en-44,"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to determine his total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the cost of the supplies.

First, let's calculate the number of candles Charlie can make with 20 pounds of beeswax:
\[ \text{Number of candles} = 20 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ candles/pound} = 200 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling 200 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 200 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$400.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the supplies:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10.00 \]

Finally, we calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the revenue:

polymath-low-en-45,"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

1. **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. **Tuesday**: She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
3. **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is $104$.",104,104

\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
80 + x - 220 = 23

polymath-low-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
2. Convert the daily egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
4. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the daily egg production into dozens:
\[ \text{Number of dozens per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Next, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, the daily earnings from selling the eggs are:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the weekly earnings, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

Thus, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week.",294,294
polymath-low-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM, we need to calculate the time it takes for each leg of the journey and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM. The distance from 1 PM to 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour, the time taken to travel this distance is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{10 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.3 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM. The distance from 4 PM to 1 PM is also 3 hours. Since Tom's ship travels at 6 miles per hour, the time taken to travel this distance is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}

Now, we sum the times for both legs of the journey:
\[
0.3 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 0.8 \text{ hours}

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since the comic books weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires.
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire.
- Therefore, the revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires.
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire.
- Therefore, the revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- The total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires.
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire.
- Therefore, the revenue from car tires on Friday is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires.
- Therefore, the revenue from truck tires on Friday is \(0\) dollars.
- The total revenue for Friday is \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars.

Now, we compare the revenues from both days:
- The revenue on Thursday is $520.
- The revenue on Friday is $480.
- The difference in revenue is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

1. Calculate the total weight of the driver and the empty truck.
2. Subtract this weight from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much additional weight the boxes can contribute.
3. Determine how many boxes can be loaded with the remaining weight.

First, we know the driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds. Let's denote the weight of each box as \( x \) pounds. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, the number of boxes, \( n \), can be expressed as \( n = \frac{3755}{15} \).

However, we need to ensure that the total weight of the boxes plus the driver and the empty truck does not exceed the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes plus the driver and the empty truck is \( 3755 + 15n \). We need to find the maximum \( n \) such that:

\[ 3755 + 15n \leq 5000 \]

Subtract 3755 from both sides of the inequality:

\[ 15n \leq 1245 \]

Now, divide both sides by 15:

\[ n \leq \frac{1245}{15} \]

polymath-low-en-70,"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from both the dance classes she teaches on weekdays and the classes she teaches on Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the dance classes on weekdays. Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day from Monday to Friday. Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the number of students per weekday class is:
\[ 15 \text{ students/class} \times 5 \text{ classes/day} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

Since she teaches 5 classes each weekday, her earnings from weekdays are:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 75 \times 5 \times 15 = 5625 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the dance classes on Saturday. She teaches 8 classes on Saturday, and each class has 15 students. Therefore, her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 8 \times 15 \times 15 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add her earnings from weekdays and Saturday to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ 5625 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:

3. **Begonias:**
   - Original price: $2.12
   - Rounded price: $2.00 (since $2.12 is closer to $2.00 than to $3.00)

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:

3. Calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does, which is half of what Sarah does.
4. Find the difference between the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2:

   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do:

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. For each pen he uses to make a new pen, he saves five pens. So, for every pen he uses, he gets five pens back.
3. Therefore, for every 6 pens (1 pen used + 5 pens saved), Ram gets 6 pens in total.

Now, we need to calculate how many sets of 6 pens Ram can get from his 25 pens. We do this by dividing 25 by 6:

\[ 25 \div 6 = 4 \text{ R } 1 \]

This means that Ram can get 4 full sets of 6 pens, and he will have 1 pen left over. So, he will have 4 pens from the first set and 1 pen from the second set, which totals to 5 pens.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist worked.**

The makeup artist works 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week. Therefore, the total number of hours worked per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total number of hours worked is:

2. Subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available to find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed given to all chickens in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, each chicken gets 15 cups of feed, so for 20 chickens, the total amount of feed is \(15 \times 20 = 300\) cups.
- In the afternoon, each chicken gets 25 cups of feed, so for 20 chickens, the total amount of feed is \(25 \times 20 = 500\) cups.
- Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is \(300 + 500 = 800\) cups.

Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for 20 chickens is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cups per day.

To find out how many cups of feed are left for the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available:

4. We can see that each subsequent glass costs 60% of the previous glass's price.

To find the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to sum the costs of all 16 glasses. This can be done using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

where:
- \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( r \) is the common ratio,
- \( n \) is the number of terms.

In this case:
- \( a = 5 \) (the cost of the first glass),
- \( r = 0.60 \) (since each subsequent glass costs 60% of the previous glass),
- \( n = 16 \) (since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - 0.60^{16}}{1 - 0.60} \]

First, calculate \( 0.60^{16} \):

\[ 0.60^{16} \approx 0.000531441 \]

Now, substitute this value back into the formula:

\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1 - 0.000531441}{0.40} \]

\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{0.999468559}{0.40} \]

\[ S_{16} = 5 \times 2.498671398 \]

\[ S_{16} \approx 12.49335699 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total cost is approximately $12.49.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.49} \]",49,64

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[ T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of sheep is \( \boxed{260} \).",260,260
polymath-low-en-7,"To determine how long it takes Carla to download the file after the restart, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

1. **Calculate the time Carla takes to download the first 60% of the file:**
   - The total file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of the file is 200 GB * 0.40 = 80 GB.
   - Carla can download 2 GB per minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time Carla takes to download the remaining 40% of the file:**
   - The remaining 60% of the file is 200 GB * 0.60 = 120 GB.
   - Carla can download 2 GB per minute.
   - Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time including the restart:**
   - Total time = Time to download the first 60% + Time to download the remaining 40% + Time for the restart.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes.

Thus, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is $120$ minutes.",120,160

First, let's calculate the distance John travels in the first 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the distance John travels in the next 2 hours in standstill traffic:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 0 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 0 \, \text{miles}
\]

Then, we calculate the distance John travels in the next 15 minutes (which is 0.25 hours) at a speed of 30 mph:
\[
\text{Distance}_3 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.25 \, \text{hours} = 7.5 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, we calculate the distance John travels in the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph:
\[
\text{Distance}_4 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 160 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we sum the distances from all segments to find the total distance John has traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 + \text{Distance}_3 + \text{Distance}_4 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 7.5 \, \text{miles} + 160 \, \text{miles} = 347.5 \, \text{miles}
\]

Since John starts 180 miles from home, the distance to his home is:
\[
\text{Distance from Home} = \text{Total Distance} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 347.5 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 167.5 \, \text{miles}

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it takes to accumulate a profit.

First, let's calculate the net profit per year. The tree grows 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue from selling the lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree each year. The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year. Therefore, the net profit per year is:

First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]
So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance are subtracted:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]
So, 16 students are remaining.

Then, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]
So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance.

Finally, we determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Solving for $x$, we get:

\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we know that Allen's current age is $11x = 11 \times 9 = 99$. To find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

polymath-low-en-31,"Let's denote the number of jelly beans in the jar as \( x \).

The first friend's guess is \( 80 \).

The second friend's guess is \( 20 \) more than half of the first friend's guess, which can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 80 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

The third friend's guess is \( 25\% \) more than the first friend's guess, which can be expressed as:

mgsm-en-188,"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( x \).

The cost of buying the bags is $20 per bag, so the total cost for \( x \) bags is:
\[ 20x \]

The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is:
\[ 2x \]

The profit from selling each bag at $30 is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

The total profit from selling \( x \) bags is:
\[ 10x \]

The trader's total profit is the sum of the profit from selling the bags and the transportation cost:
\[ 10x + 2x = 12x \]

We know the total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 12x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{12} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Since the number of bags must be a whole number, we need to check if \( x = 33 \) or \( x = 34 \) fits the profit condition.

If \( x = 33 \):
\[ 12 \times 33 = 396 \]
The profit is $396, which is less than $400.

If \( x = 34 \):
\[ 12 \times 34 = 408 \]
The profit is $408, which is more than $400.

Therefore, the trader must have sold 34 bags to achieve a profit of $400. The final answer is:

Solving for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = \frac{20.25}{3} = 6.75 \]
The total cost of the food is $4.50 less than the total cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost of the rides is:

The total cost of all the expenses is the sum of the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]
Since the total cost is $102 and it is to be split evenly among the three friends, each friend pays:

Therefore, each of them paid $34. The final answer is:

2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Account for the trees that die after 10 years.

First, let's find the net change in the number of trees each year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net change is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years. Since he starts with 50 trees and the net change is 8 trees per year, after 10 years he will have:

mgsm-en-211,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write the equation:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs collected per day as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red chickens.",4,4

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers counted over the three days to find the number counted on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers counted on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of customers counted over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers counted on the third day. Then, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250
mgsm-en-214,"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

Additionally, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the leaks empty the pools at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons. This gives us the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 4S \)

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this amount to find Yuri's points:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44

   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, we add 17 to this amount to find Brianna's points:
   \[

polymath-low-en-84,"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write another equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
1. \( W = L + 8 \)
2. \( W + L = 22 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplify and solve for \( L \):
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we have the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the first equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games. The final answer is:

The initial salary of Sylvie is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year.

**Step 1: Initial Salary**
\[ \text{Initial Salary} = \$600 \]

**Step 2: Salary Increase for the First Year**
\[ \text{Increase for the first year} = 10\% \times 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60 \]

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson:
   \[
   A = J + 5

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey:
   \[
   A = C - 2

4. Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls to find out how many are not in the Girl Scout.

First, we calculate the number of boys in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we have:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80

   \[
   \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}

\[ 30 - x - 20 + 5 \]

This simplifies to:

polymath-low-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV and then subtract the time spent on other days.

First, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV on Thursday:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/night} + 0.5 \text{ hours/night} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV on Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these times together gives the total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours} - 7 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{0.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 1 \text{ episode} \]

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:

polymath-low-en-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). According to the problem, he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so he has \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left. We know that after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked \( 50 \) cookies last year. The final answer is:

   The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards shore.

2. **Determine the total distance rowed:**
   Julia rowed 20 feet to reach the shore.

3. **Calculate the total time taken to row 20 feet:**
   It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet.

4. **Calculate the rate of water leakage per second:**
   \[
   \text{Rate of water leakage per second} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{20 \text{ feet}} = \frac{2}{200} = \frac{1}{100} \text{ liters per second}

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. Each teacher uses the whiteboard in each of their lessons.

Next, we calculate the total number of lessons for all 4 teachers per day:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted. Since 5 flowers did not grow, we subtract 5 from 30:

Therefore, the number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
polymath-low-en-114,"Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

According to the information given, Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = 50 \times D \]

We are also told that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can write:

\[ \text{Jamal's phone capacity} = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

Substituting the expression for Brittany's phone capacity from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 1800 = 6 \times (50 \times D) \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 = 300 \times D \]

Dividing both sides by 300 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{1800}{300} \]

\[ D = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).",6,6
polymath-low-en-115,"To calculate the profit Sasha makes from selling the lumber, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**
   - Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Sasha bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost of all lumber:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:**
   - Sasha sells all the boards at the original price, which is not specified in the problem. However, we can assume she sells them at the original price to calculate the profit. Let's denote the original price per board as \( P \).

   - Total number of boards sold:
     \[
     \text{Total number of boards} = 10 + 5 = 15
     \]

   - Total revenue from selling all boards:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 15 \times P
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 15P - 180
     \]

Since the original price \( P \) is not provided, we cannot calculate a specific numerical value for the profit. However, if we assume the original price is known, we can substitute it into the equation to find the exact profit.

For example, if the original price per board is $20:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 15 \times 20 - 180 = 300 - 180 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, if the original price per board is $20, Sasha makes a profit of $120.",120,90
polymath-low-en-116,"Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy uses as \( S \) and the number of cups of water she uses as \( W \). According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. We can express this relationship as:

\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

We also know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write:

\[ S + W = 120 \]

From the ratio, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):

\[ W = \frac{13}{7} S \]

Now substitute this expression for \( W \) into the total amount equation:

\[ S + \frac{13}{7} S = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{7}{7} S + \frac{13}{7} S = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20}{7} S = 120 \]

To solve for \( S \), multiply both sides by 7/20:

\[ S = 120 \times \frac{7}{20} \]
\[ S = 6 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is \( \boxed{42} \).",42,42

polymath-low-en-118,"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we start by calculating the total number of vehicles imported on the first day. According to the problem, there were 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is the total number of vehicles at the port minus the number of vehicles imported on the first day. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as \( x \). Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is:

\[ 5x \]

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is the sum of the vehicles imported on the first day and the vehicles imported on the second day. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 10 + 5x = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 5x = 30 - 10 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
polymath-low-en-119,"To solve the problem, let's denote Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years ago as \( A \) and \( L \) respectively. According to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. This can be expressed as:

\[ A = 1.3L \]

Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40 percent, and he was earning $40,000. Therefore, his salary four years later is:

\[ A + 0.4A = 1.4A \]

We know that four years later, Adrien's salary was $40,000, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 1.4A = 40000 \]

To find \( A \), we solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.4:

\[ A = \frac{40000}{1.4} = 28571.43 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 1.3 times Lylah's salary four years ago, we have:

\[ A = 1.3L \]
\[ 28571.43 = 1.3L \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.3:

\[ L = \frac{28571.43}{1.3} = 21978.37 \]

Now, we need to find the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later. Adrien's salary four years later was $40,000, and Lylah's salary four years ago was $21,978.37, so her salary four years later would be:

\[ L + 0.4L = 1.4L \]
\[ 21978.37 + 0.4 \times 21978.37 = 1.4 \times 21978.37 = 30789.70 \]

Therefore, the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is:
