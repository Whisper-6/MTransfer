mgsm-es-48,"English translation: Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to secure tomato plants in the garden. She cut the wire into pieces of 6 inches each. How many pieces did she get?

To solve this, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the length of each piece is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she got:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces.

Therefore, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.",8,8
mgsm-es-49,"English translation: Richard lives in a 15-story apartment building. On each floor, there are 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What is the total number of unoccupied units in the building?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of units that are occupied.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units.
\[ \text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of units that are occupied.
3/4 of the building is occupied.
\[ \text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
\[ \text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is $\boxed{30}$.",30,30

Por cada neumático de camión que repare, el mecánico cobrará $60 y por cada neumático de automóvil que repare, el mecánico cobrará $40. El jueves, el mecánico repara 6 neumáticos de camión y 4 neumáticos de automóvil. El viernes, el mecánico repara 12 neumáticos de automóvil y ninguno de camión. ¿Cuántos más ingresos obtuvo el mecánico el día con mayores ingresos?

Answer: To determine which day the mechanic earned more, we need to calculate the total earnings for both days.

For Thursday:
- Earnings from truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Earnings from car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total earnings on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

For Friday:
- Earnings from car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total earnings on Friday: $480

Comparing the earnings:
- Thursday: $520
- Friday: $480

The mechanic earned more on Thursday. The difference in earnings is:
$520 - $480 = $40

mgsm-es-54,"English translation: The Doubtfire sisters are driving to their house with 7 cats they adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to tell them that their two domestic cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, the other cat, who has had 12. How many cats are now in the Doubtfire family?

Spanish translation: Las hermanas Doubtfire están conduciendo a su casa con 7 gatitos que adoptaron en el refugio de animales local cuando su madre las llama para avisarles que sus dos gatas domésticas acaban de tener gatitos. Les dice que Patchy, la primera gata, ha tenido tres veces la cantidad de gatitos adoptados, mientras que Trixie, la otra gata, ha tenido 12. ¿Cuántos gatitos tiene ahora la familia Doubtfire?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of gatitos the family Doubtfire has now. 

1. Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of adopted kittens as Trixie. Since Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens, Patchy has had \(3 \times 12 = 36\) adopted kittens.
2. Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 adopted kittens.
3. The total number of adopted kittens is \(36 + 12 = 48\).
4. The family Doubtfire originally had 7 cats, and they adopted 48 kittens. Therefore, the total number of cats in the family now is \(7 + 48 = 55\).

To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of berries in the bunches and then add the individual berries.

1. Calculate the number of berries in the bunches:
\[ \text{Number of berries in bunches} = \text{Number of bunches} \times \text{Berries per bunch} \]
\[ \text{Number of berries in bunches} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

2. Add the individual berries:
\[ \text{Total number of berries} = \text{Number of berries in bunches} + \text{Individual berries} \]

To solve this, we first calculate the total cost before insurance:

Total cost before insurance = Material cost + Jeweler's cost
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800
Total cost before insurance = $1300

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Insurance cost = 10% of $1300
Insurance cost = 0.10 * $1300
Insurance cost = $130

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to get the total amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Insurance cost
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130
Total amount paid = $1430

So, Janet paid $1430 in total.",1430,1430

Si la empresa de streaming le cobró el monto inicial por la primera mitad del año y luego le cobró un 10% menos de dinero en la otra mitad del año, calcule el monto total que ella habrá pagado al final del año por el servicio de streaming.

To find the total amount paid, we need to calculate the amount paid in the first half of the year and the amount paid in the second half of the year, then add them together.

1. Calculate the amount paid in the first half of the year:
   - The first half of the year is 6 months.
   - The initial amount paid is $140 per month.
   - Total amount for the first half = $140 * 6 = $840.

2. Calculate the amount paid in the second half of the year:
   - The second half of the year is also 6 months.
   - The amount paid in the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 = $140 * 0.10 = $14.
   - Amount paid in the second half = $140 - $14 = $126.

3. Calculate the total amount paid at the end of the year:
   - Total amount = Amount paid in the first half + Amount paid in the second half.
   - Total amount = $840 + $126 = $966.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena will have paid at the end of the year for the streaming service is $\boxed{966}$.",966,1596

Question: Sophia is thinking about taking a car trip on the highway and wants to know how far she can travel with a full tank of gas. She has driven 100 miles since she last filled up the tank and had to put in 4 gallons of gas to refill it. The owner's manual for her car states that the tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive with a full tank of gas?

Now, let's answer the question in Spanish:

Si Sophia ha conducido 100 millas desde que llenó el tanque por última vez y ha tenido que ponerle 4 galones de gasolina para volver a llenarlo, y el manual del propietario de su automóvil dice que en el tanque entran 12 galones de gasolina, podemos calcular cuántas millas puede hacer con un solo tanque de gasolina. Primero, necesitamos determinar cuántas millas puede recorrer con un solo galón de gasolina. Para hacer esto, dividimos la distancia que ha recorrido (100 millas) entre el número de galones que ha usado (4 galones): 100 millas / 4 galones = 25 millas por galón. Ahora, multiplicamos este valor por el número de galones que puede llenar el tanque (12 galones): 25 millas por galón * 12 galones = 300 millas. Por lo tanto, Sophia puede hacer 300 millas con un solo tanque de gasolina.

Explanation: 
- Jim watches TV for 2 hours each time.
- He reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour.
- He does this 3 times a week.
- By the end of 4 weeks, he would have watched TV for 4 weeks * 2 hours = 8 hours.
- He would have read for 4 weeks * 3 times * 1 hour = 12 hours.
- Therefore, he would have spent 8 hours + 12 hours = 20 hours watching TV and reading in total.",20,36

   - Number of players per school: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Number of coaches per school: \(2\)

2. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of players and coaches per school by the number of schools:
   - Total number of players: \(4 \times 10 = 40\)
   - Total number of coaches: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)

3. Summing up the total number of people:
   - Total people: \(40 + 8 = 48\)

Spanish translation: Un cazador de tesoros encontró un cofre lleno de diamantes. Había 175 diamantes, 35 rubíes menos que los diamantes y dos veces la cantidad de esmeraldas que de rubíes. ¿Cuántas gemas había en el cofre?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rubies and emeralds first, and then add the number of diamonds to find the total number of gems.

1. **Determine the number of rubies:**
   - The number of rubies is 35 less than the number of diamonds.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of rubies.
   - Given: \( R = 175 - 35 \)
   - Calculate \( R \):
     \[
     R = 175 - 35 = 140
     \]

2. **Determine the number of emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of emeralds.
   - Given: \( E = 2R \)
   - Substitute \( R \) with 140:
     \[
     E = 2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of gems:**
   - The total number of gems is the sum of the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.
   - Let \( T \) represent the total number of gems.
   - Given: \( T = 175 + R + E \)
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( E \) with their values:
     \[
     T = 175 + 140 + 280
     \]
   - Calculate \( T \):
     \[
     T = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We know there are 60 girls.
   - The number of boys is twice the number of girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 120 + 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers:**
   - We know there are 5 students for each teacher.
   - To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher.

Spanish translation: Bailey comienza con una determinada cantidad de dinero. Luego, recibe una mesada semanal de $5 durante 8 semanas. Si al final de las 8 semanas tiene $100 en total, ¿con cuánto dinero comenzó Bailey?

Answer: Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as \( x \).

Over 8 weeks, she receives a weekly allowance of $5, so the total amount she receives from the allowance is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) dollars.

Adding this to her initial amount, we get \( x + 40 \).

According to the problem, at the end of 8 weeks, she has $100 in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

Spanish translation: ¿Cuánto dinero ahorra Vincent si compra 18 flores al mejor precio?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at each option and then find the difference between the two options.

1. **Option 1: Bouquets of 3 flowers for $2.50 each**
   - Cost per bouquet: $2.50
   - Number of bouquets needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars

2. **Option 2: Bouquets of 2 flowers for $1.00 each**
   - Cost per bouquet: $1.00
   - Number of bouquets needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
   - Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9 \) dollars

3. **Comparison of the two options:**
   - Cost at Option 1: $15.00
   - Cost at Option 2: $9.00

4. **Amount saved:**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water received by the girls and the boy, and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

1. Calculate the total amount of water received by the girls:
   \[
   \text{Total water for girls} = 2 \times \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}

mgsm-es-87,"English translation: A company pays each of its employees $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of its employees by 10% of their initial salary each year for those who have been in the company for five years. If Sylvie just turned 5 years old at the end of last year, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?

To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary increase over three years.

1. Calculate the salary increase for the first year:
   \[
   \text{Salary increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, her salary at the end of the first year is:
   \[
   600 + 60 = 660 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the salary increase for the second year:
   \[
   \text{Salary increase} = 660 \times 0.10 = 66 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, her salary at the end of the second year is:
   \[
   660 + 66 = 726 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the salary increase for the third year:
   \[
   \text{Salary increase} = 726 \times 0.10 = 72.6 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, her salary at the end of the third year is:
   \[
   726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $\boxed{798.6}$ dollars.",6,9360
mgsm-es-88,"English translation: The first album by Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as the one by Harald. Together, they sold 88,000 copies. How many copies did Harald sell?

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( M \) be the number of copies of Marilyn's album and \( H \) be the number of copies of Harald's album. According to the problem, we have:

\[ M = 10H \]

And we also know that:

\[ M + H = 88,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 10H + H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his album.

To solve this, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
2. Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
3. Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
4. Let \( I \) be James's age.

From the information given:
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
- James is 10 years old: \( I = 10 \)
- James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( I = C - 1 \)

Since James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, we can find Corey's age:
\[ I = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age using the second equation:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

Finally, we can find Jackson's age using the first equation:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is $\boxed{4}$.",4,4

Now, let's translate the question into Spanish and solve it:

Spanish translation: El lunes, Sue comió 4 veces más galletas que su hermana. El martes, comió dos veces más galletas que su hermana. Su hermana comió 5 galletas el lunes y 13 al día siguiente. Si 1 galleta tiene 200 calorías, ¿cuántas calorías más consumió Sue con respecto a su hermana?

To solve this, we need to determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day and then calculate the difference in calories.

1. **Monday:**
   - Her sister ate 5 cookies.
   - Sue ate 4 times more than her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Her sister ate 13 cookies.
   - Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each ate:

- Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each:

- Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories:

polymath-low-es-3,"English translation: James decides to run 3 speed races 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters in each speed race. How many meters does he run in total per week?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James runs per week. He runs 3 speed races 3 times a week, and each speed race is 60 meters long.

First, calculate the total distance for one speed race:
\[ 60 \text{ meters} \]

Next, calculate the total distance for one speed race 3 times a week:
\[ 60 \text{ meters} \times 3 = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since James runs 3 speed races 3 times a week, we multiply the distance of one speed race by 3:
\[ 180 \text{ meters} \times 3 = 540 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters per week.",540,540

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city and then sum them up.

1. **Seattle**: Given as 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston**: Since there are 4 times as many sheep in Charleston as in Seattle, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. **Toulouse**: Since there are twice as many sheep in Toulouse as in Charleston, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \text{ sheep}

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after contemporary dance enrollment.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance from the remaining students.
5. Determine the percentage of the total students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is \(20\%\) of 20, which is \(0.20 \times 20 = 4\) students.
2. The number of students remaining after contemporary dance enrollment is \(20 - 4 = 16\) students.

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the rest of the distance?

To calculate the speed required for the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has spent walking and the total distance she has already covered. Then we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

1. Total distance covered: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
2. Total time spent: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
3. Average speed required: 4 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the speed for the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. Since the book was sold at a 25% discount, Kyle paid 75% of the original price. This can be expressed as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \):

To solve this, we first calculate the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and bananas:

- Chicken dish: $12.5
- Milk: 3 boxes * $3/box = $9
- Bananas: 4 boxes * $1.50/box = $6

Now, we add these costs together to find the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and bananas:

$12.5 + $9 + $6 = $27.5

Marie paid a total of $50, so we subtract the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and bananas from $50 to find the cost of the pizza:

$50 - $27.5 = $22.5

Finally, we divide the cost of the pizza by the price per box to find out how many boxes Marie ordered:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of ice cream boxes Cynthia will buy and the total cost.

1. Calculate the number of ice cream boxes Cynthia will buy in 60 days:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Cynthia buys ice cream every night, so she buys ice cream 7 times a week.
   - In 60 days, she will buy ice cream \( \frac{60}{7} \) times.

2. Calculate the total number of ice cream boxes:
   - Each box contains 15 portions of ice cream.
   - Cynthia will buy \( \frac{60}{7} \times 15 \) boxes.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each box costs $4.00.
   - The total cost will be the number of boxes multiplied by the cost per box.

Let's perform the calculations:

\[
\text{Number of ice cream boxes} = \frac{60}{7} \times 15
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \left( \frac{60}{7} \times 15 \right) \times 4

First, calculate \( \frac{60}{7} \):

\[
\frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57
\]

Now multiply by 15:

\[
8.57 \times 15 \approx 128.55

polymath-low-es-31,"English translation: Gunter is trying to count the rubber candy pieces in a bottle. He asks his friends how many they think are in the bottle. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half of the first. The third says 25% more than the first. What is their average calculation?

To find the average calculation, we need to calculate the number of candies each friend thinks there are in the bottle and then find the average of these numbers.

1. The first friend thinks there are 80 candies.
2. The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half of the first friend's count. So, the second friend's count is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) candies.
3. The third friend thinks there are 25% more than the first friend's count. So, the third friend's count is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) candies.

Now, we calculate the average of these numbers:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average calculation is 80.

Spanish translation: Josh decide a remodelar y vender una casa. Compra una casa de $80 000 y luego agrega $50 000 para las reparaciones. Esto aumenta un 150 % el valor de la casa. ¿Cuánto obtuvo de ganancia?

To calculate the gain, we first need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. The increase in value is 150% of the original price of the house, which means the new value is 250% of the original price ($80,000).

Let's calculate the new value of the house:

\[
\text{New value} = \text{Original price} + (\text{Original price} \times \text{Increase percentage})
\]

\[
\text{New value} = 80,000 + (80,000 \times 1.5)
\]

\[
\text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000
\]

\[
\text{New value} = 200,000
\]

Now, we can calculate the gain by subtracting the original price from the new value:

\[
\text{Gain} = \text{New value} - \text{Original price}
\]

\[
\text{Gain} = 200,000 - 80,000
\]

\[
\text{Gain} = 120,000

So, Josh obtained a gain of $\boxed{120000}$ dollars.",120000,70000

Answer: 100 ovejas

Explanation: 
1. We know that in Seattle there are 20 sheep.
2. In Charleston, there are 4 times more sheep than in Seattle, so in Charleston there are \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. In Toulouse, there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston, so in Toulouse there are \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.
4. Adding up the sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we get \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\) sheep in total.

Usually, she can download 2 GB per minute, but during 40% of the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How long does the file download take?

To calculate the total time, we need to consider the time lost due to the restart and the time lost during the 40% of the download.

1. Calculate the time lost during the 40% of the download:
\[ \text{Time lost during 40%} = 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 \times 2 \text{ minutes/GB} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

2. Calculate the time lost due to the restart:
\[ \text{Time lost due to restart} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Calculate the time lost during the 60% of the download:
\[ \text{Time lost during 60%} = 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.60 \times 2 \text{ minutes/GB} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

4. Calculate the total time lost:
\[ \text{Total time lost} = 160 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 420 \text{ minutes} \]

5. Calculate the total time for the download:
\[ \text{Total time for download} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 6000 \text{ minutes} \]

6. Convert the total time to hours:
\[ \text{Total time for download in hours} = \frac{6000 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 100 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Carla takes to download the file is 100 hours.",100,160

How far from the house is he at the end of those 4 hours?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John drives in 4 hours.

1. **First 2 hours in traffic jams:**

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. Cost of eclairs: \(3 \text{ dozen} \times \$68 \text{ per dozen} = \$204\)
2. Cost of miniature croissants: \(2 \text{ dozen} \times \$80 \text{ per dozen} = \$160\)

Watering and fertilizing the tree costs $3 annually. How many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it will take to accumulate a profit of at least $90.

1. Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
   \[
   \text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5
   \]

2. Calculate the annual cost of planting, watering, and fertilizing the tree:
   \[
   \text{Annual cost} = \$90 + \$3 = \$93
   \]

3. Calculate the net profit per year:
   \[
   \text{Net profit per year} = \text{Annual revenue} - \text{Annual cost} = \$10.5 - \$93 = -\$82.5
   \]

Since the net profit per year is negative ($-82.5), Carlos will not start making a profit until after the first year. Therefore, it will take 1 year for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree.

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from both her teaching and coaching positions.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings from teaching} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings from coaching} = 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and bananas, and then subtract this from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizza. Finally, we can determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken dish:
\[ \text{Cost of chicken dish} = \$12.5 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the milk:
\[ \text{Cost of milk} = 3 \times \$3 = \$9 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the bananas:
\[ \text{Cost of bananas} = 4 \times \$1.50 = \$6 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the chicken dish, milk, and bananas:
\[ \text{Total cost of chicken dish, milk, and bananas} = \$12.5 + \$9 + \$6 = \$27.5 \]

Marie paid a total of $50, so we subtract the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and bananas from $50 to find the cost of the pizza:
\[ \text{Cost of pizza} = \$50 - \$27.5 = \$22.5 \]

Finally, we divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box of pizza to find the number of boxes Marie ordered:
\[ \text{Number of boxes of pizza} = \frac{\$22.5}{\$8.50} = 2.65 \]

Since Marie cannot order a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[ \text{Number of boxes of pizza} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered $\boxed{2}$ boxes of pizza.",2,2

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of ice cream portions Cynthia will eat in 60 days and then determine how many ice cream boxes she will need to buy. Finally, we will calculate the total cost.

1. Calculate the total number of ice cream portions Cynthia will eat in 60 days:
   - There are 7 nights in a week, so in 60 days, there are \( \frac{60}{7} \) weeks.
   - Each week, she eats 15 portions of ice cream, so in 60 days, she will eat \( 15 \times \frac{60}{7} \) portions of ice cream.

2. Calculate the number of ice cream boxes needed:
   - Each box contains 15 portions of ice cream.
   - The number of boxes needed is the total number of portions divided by 15.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each box costs $4.00.
   - The total cost is the number of boxes multiplied by $4.00.

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Total portions in 60 days:
   \[
   \frac{60}{7} \times 15 = \frac{900}{7} \approx 128.57
   \]
   Since she can't buy a fraction of a box, we round up to the next whole number, which is 129 boxes.

2. Number of boxes needed:
   \[
   \frac{129}{15} = 8.6

   Again, since she can't buy a fraction of a box, we round up to the next whole number, which is 9 boxes.

3. Total cost:

mgsm-es-29,"English translation: Gloria is buying shoes when she sees a pair of boots that fit within her budget for shoes. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high-top shoes that together cost $5 less than the boots. If a pair of high-top shoes costs $33 and the other costs double, how much do the boots cost?

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of one pair of high-top shoes is $33, and the cost of the other pair is double that, which is $66. The total cost of the two pairs of high-top shoes is $33 + $66 = $99.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high-top shoes is $5 less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is $104.

In Spanish, the answer is:

\(\boxed{104}\)",104,104
mgsm-es-30,"English translation: The ratio of the ages of Darrell and Allen is 7:11. Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now if their current total age is 162.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen, and then use that information to find Allen's age 10 years from now.

Let's denote the current age of Darrell as \( D \) and the current age of Allen as \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]
This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We also know that the sum of their current ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \), we get:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99 years. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
mgsm-es-31,"English translation: Gunter is trying to count the rubber candy pieces in a bottle. He asks his friends how many they think are in the bottle. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half of the first. The third says 25% more than the first. What is their average calculation?

To solve this problem, let's calculate the number of candies each person thinks are in the bottle:

1. The first person thinks there are 80 candies.
2. The second person thinks there are 20 more than half of the first person's count, which is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) candies.
3. The third person thinks there are 25% more than the first person's count, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) candies.

Now, let's calculate the average of these three numbers:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of money John has from selling the Lego toys and then subtract the cost of the video games he bought. Finally, we will subtract the leftover money from the total to find out how many Lego toys he still has.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total amount of money from selling the Lego toys:
\[ 13 \text{ toys} \times \$15 \text{ per toy} = \$195 \]

2. Calculate the total cost of the video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

3. Determine the total amount of money John has after selling the Lego toys and buying the video games:
\[ \$195 + \$160 = \$355 \]

4. Subtract the leftover money from the total to find out how much money John has left:
\[ \$355 - \$5 = \$350 \]

5. Calculate the total number of Lego toys John has:
\[ \frac{\$350}{\$15 \text{ per toy}} = 23.33 \]

Since John can't have a fraction of a Lego toy, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[ 23 \text{ Lego toys} \]

6. Calculate the number of Lego toys John still has after buying the video games:
\[ 23 \text{ Lego toys} - 8 \text{ video games} = 15 \text{ Lego toys} \]

So, John still has $\boxed{15}$ Lego toys.",15,2

To find the running speed, we need to calculate the total time he spends running and the total distance he runs.

1. Calculate the total time he spends running:
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
   - Total time: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

2. Calculate the total distance he runs:
   - First day: 3 hours * 60 miles/hour = 180 miles
   - Second day: 1.5 hours * 60 miles/hour = 90 miles
   - Third day: 1.5 hours * 60 miles/hour = 90 miles
   - Total distance: 180 + 90 + 90 = 360 miles

To calculate the net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the net profit.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total cost of supplies for 20 candles:**
   - Cost of honeycomb: 20 candles * 1 pound/candle = 20 pounds
   - Cost of wicks: 20 candles * $100 = $2000
   - Total cost = $2000 (wicks) + $100 (supplies) = $2100

2. **Total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Revenue per candle: $2
   - Total revenue = 20 candles * $2 = $40

3. **Net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $40 - $2100 = -$2060

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( G = S + 30 \) (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)
2. \( S + G = 110 \) (The total number of coins is 110)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\( S + (S + 30) = 110 \)
\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)
\( 2S = 80 \)
\( S = 40 \)

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\( G = S + 30 \)
\( G = 40 + 30 \)
\( G = 70 \)

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

polymath-low-es-44,"English translation: Charlie wants to sell wax beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 cone-shaped candles. A pound of beeswax and the stakes cost $100 in supplies. If he sells each candle for $2, how much net profit will he make when he makes and sells 20 candles?

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles:**
   - Cost per candle = $2
   - Number of candles = 20
   - Total cost = 20 * $2 = $40

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Selling price per candle = $2
   - Number of candles = 20
   - Total revenue = 20 * $2 = $40

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $40 - $40 = $0

Therefore, the net profit Charlie will make when he makes and sells 20 candles is $\boxed{0}$.",0,20
polymath-low-es-45,"English translation: Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and delivers to her clients daily as a permanent job. The blog article takes an average of 4 hours between research and writing. Last week, Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent on the articles over the three days.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Meredith wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Total articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the articles:
- Time per article = 4 hours.
- Total time = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith dedicated to the articles over the three days is $\boxed{104}$ hours.",104,104

polymath-low-es-47,"English translation: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?

To solve this, let's denote:
- The cost of a blue tie as \( B \).
- The cost of a red tie as \( R \).

From the information given:
1. \( B = 40 \) (cost of a blue tie)
2. \( R = B + 0.5B = 1.5B \) (cost of a red tie)
3. John spent $200 on blue ties, so the total cost for blue ties is \( 200 \).

The total cost for blue ties can be represented as:
\[ 200 = 2 \times B \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 2 \times R \]

Substituting \( R \) with \( 1.5B \):
\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 2 \times 1.5B = 3B \]

Since \( B = 40 \):
\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Therefore, John spent $120 on red ties.

To solve this, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet is equal to 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she got:

$$
\text{Number of pieces} = \frac{\text{Total length of wire}}{\text{Length of each piece}} = \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches}} = 8

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of units in the building and then find out how many of those units are occupied and how many are vacant.

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building:
   \[
   \text{Total units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor} = 15 \times 8 = 120
   \]

2. Calculate the number of occupied units:
   \[
   \text{Occupied units} = \text{Total units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90
   \]

3. Calculate the number of vacant units:
   \[
   \text{Vacant units} = \text{Total units} - \text{Occupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30

To solve this, we first need to determine how many popsicles are left after Jean eats 2 of them. Then, we divide the remaining popsicles by the number of popsicles per bag to find out how many bags Jean can fill.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Jean starts with 30 popsicles.
2. Jean eats 2 popsicles, so the number of remaining popsicles is \(30 - 2 = 28\).

polymath-low-es-56,"English translation: Peter plans to go to the cinema this week. He always buys one ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has $42 for the week, how many times can he go to the cinema?

Answer in Spanish: Peter puede ir al cine 6 veces.

Explanation: 
1. Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so in total he spends $14 per visit to the cinema.
2. With $42 available, we divide the total amount by the cost per visit: $42 ÷ $14 = 3 visits.
3. However, since he can't go to the cinema 3 times and then have money left, we need to consider the remainder. If he goes 3 times, he spends $42 - $42 = $0, leaving him with $0.
4. Therefore, the correct number of visits is 3, not 4. The remainder of the division (3) indicates that he can go to the cinema 3 times and have exactly $0 left.",0,3
polymath-low-es-57,"English translation: A wooden bridge cannot support more than 5000 pounds. A fully loaded delivery truck with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will cross the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds.

Let's denote:
- \( n \) as the number of boxes.
- The weight of each box as 15 pounds.

The total weight of the boxes is \( 15n \) pounds.

The total weight of the truck, including the boxes, is the sum of the driver's weight and the weight of the boxes:
\[ 3755 + 15n \]

We need this total weight to be less than or equal to the bridge's weight limit:
\[ 3755 + 15n \leq 5000 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 15n \leq 5000 - 3755 \]
\[ 15n \leq 1245 \]
\[ n \leq \frac{1245}{15} \]
\[ n \leq 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of oranges in good condition. We know that the total number of oranges is 25, and we have the following information:

- 1 orange is in poor condition.
- 20% of the oranges have not ripened.
- 2 oranges are sour.
- The rest are in good condition.

Let's calculate the number of oranges in good condition:

1. Calculate the number of oranges that have not ripened:
\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 25 \times 20\% = 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

2. Calculate the total number of oranges that are not in good condition (including the poor condition and the unripe ones):
\[ \text{Total not in good condition} = 1 + 5 = 6 \]

3. Subtract the number of not in good condition oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of oranges in good condition:
\[ \text{Number of oranges in good condition} = 25 - 6 = 19 \]

Each school has sent a women's basketball team and a men's basketball team, and each team consists of 5 players. Additionally, each school has sent one coach for each team. In total, how many people have sent all the schools?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people sent by all the schools. Each school has sent 2 teams (one for women's basketball and one for men's basketball), and each team has 5 players, plus 1 coach for each team.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Each school has sent 2 teams.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each team has 1 coach.

So, for one school:
- Number of players: \(2 \text{ teams} \times 5 \text{ players/team} = 10 \text{ players}\)
- Number of coaches: \(2 \text{ teams} \times 1 \text{ coach/team} = 2 \text{ coaches}\)

Total number of people for one school:
- Players: 10
- Coaches: 2
- Total: \(10 + 2 = 12\)

polymath-low-es-77,"English translation: If Raymond washes half the laundry that Sarah does, and Sarah washes four times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash if Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of laundry Sarah washes:**
   - Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry David washes:**
   - Since Sarah washes four times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
     \]
     \[
     400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
     \]
     Solving for David's laundry:
     \[
     \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond washes:**
   - Raymond washes half the laundry that Sarah does, so:
     \[
     \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash is $\boxed{100}$ pounds.",100,100

Spanish translation: ¿Cuánto dinero ahorra Vincent si compra 18 flores al mejor precio?

To determine the best price for 18 flowers, we need to calculate the cost for both options:

1. **Bouquets of 3 flowers for $2.50:**
   - Number of bouquets: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - Cost per bouquet: $2.50
   - Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars

2. **Bouquets of 2 flowers for $1.00:**
   - Number of bouquets: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
   - Cost per bouquet: $1.00
   - Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9 \) dollars

Comparing the two options:
- Best price: $9.00 (for 9 bouquets of 2 flowers)
- Cost for 18 flowers: $15.00

The savings by choosing the best price is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boys in the 5th grade.
2. Calculate the number of girls in the 5th grade.
3. Calculate the number of girls in the Girl Explorer group.
4. Subtract the number of Girl Explorer girls from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the Girl Explorer group.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Calculate the number of boys in the 5th grade:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{2 \times 200}{5} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
   \]

2. Calculate the number of girls in the 5th grade:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - \text{Number of boys} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

3. Calculate the number of girls in the Girl Explorer group:
   \[
   \text{Number of Girl Explorer girls} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{2 \times 120}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
   \]

4. Calculate the number of girls not in the Girl Explorer group:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in the Girl Explorer group} = \text{Number of girls} - \text{Number of Girl Explorer girls} = 120 - 80 = 40

Therefore, the number of girls not in the Girl Explorer group is $\boxed{40}$.",40,40

He only read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to complete the reading, how many pages should he read on average per day?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages the student needs to read and then determine how many pages he should read on average per day over the remaining 4 days.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages the student needs to read:

\[
4 \text{ (science)} + 20 \text{ (social studies)} + 7 \text{ (history)} + 8 \text{ (geography)} = 39 \text{ pages}

Next, we know that the student has already read 15 pages on Monday and has 4 more days to complete the reading. Therefore, the total number of days available for reading is:

\[
1 \text{ (Monday)} + 4 \text{ (remaining days)} = 5 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many pages the student should read on average per day over the remaining 4 days. We do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of remaining days:

\[
\frac{39 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 9.75 \text{ pages per day}

Explanation: Poppy initially places one fourth of the 1000 pieces on the board, which is 1000/4 = 250 pieces. So there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mother then places one third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750/3 = 250 pieces. So there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one episode of 1 hour and one 30-minute episode. On Friday, he stayed up late on the weekend and watched two episodes of 1 hour. If he watched a total of 7 hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total minutes of television Frankie watched on each day and then subtract the known amounts to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night = 60 minutes each night
- Wednesday: 30 minutes
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours = 120 minutes

Total minutes watched: 60 + 60 + 30 + 90 + 120 = 380 minutes

Total hours watched: 7 hours

Total minutes watched: 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes

Subtract the known minutes:

420 minutes - 380 minutes = 40 minutes

Since each 30-minute episode is 30 minutes, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:

40 minutes / 30 minutes/episode = 1.33 episodes

Since he can't watch a fraction of an episode, we round down to the nearest whole number:

The next day, they brought more containers, and the total number of vehicles in the port increased to 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported the second day, assuming each container has 5 vehicles.

Answer: Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as \( x \). Each container contains 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is \( 5x \).

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, which totals \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) vehicles. After the second day, the total number of vehicles in the port is 30. Therefore, the equation representing the total number of vehicles after the second day is:

\[ 10 + 5x = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 5x = 30 - 10 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, the number of containers that were imported the second day is \( \boxed{4} \).",4,4

If their salaries increased at the same rate, and four years ago Adrien earned $40,000, calculate the total salary they received four years later.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Adrien's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

Let's start with step 1. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times (1 + 0.30) \]

\[ 40,000 = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times 1.30 \]

Solving for Lylah's salary four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = 30,769.23 \]

Now, let's move to step 2. If Adrien's salary four years later was 40% higher than what he had earned four years ago, we can calculate his salary four years later as follows:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} \times (1 + 0.40) \]

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40,000 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56,000 \]

For step 3, since their salaries increased at the same rate, Lylah's salary four years later would be:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times (1 + 0.40) \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43,117.12 \]

Finally, for step 4, we sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = \text{Adrien's salary four years later} + \text{Lylah's salary four years later} \]

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56,000 + 43,117.12 \]

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99,117.12 \]

Therefore, the total salary that Adrien and Lylah received four years later is $\boxed{99117.12}$.",12,95200

Answer in Spanish: Rosie puede correr 10 millas por hora durante 3 horas. Después de eso, corre 5 millas por hora. ¿Cuántas millas puede correr en 7 horas?

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she runs during the first 3 hours and the distance she runs during the next 4 hours (since 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours).

Distance = Speed × Time

For the first 3 hours:
Distance_1 = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

For the next 4 hours:
Distance_2 = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

Total distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2 = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

She puts stamps on a third of the stamps that need to be put on. If now there are 30 stamps on the stack that already have stamps, how many stamps were on that stack when Jennie started?

Answer: Let's denote the number of stamps on the stack that already have stamps as \( x \). After Jennie puts stamps on a third of the stamps that need to be put on, she puts stamps on \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) stamps. Therefore, the total number of stamps on the stack that already have stamps becomes \( x + 20 \). According to the problem, this number is 30. So, we have:

\[ x + 20 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 30 - 20 \]

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much money will he spend if each pepper costs $15?

Spanish translation: La madre de Well vende sandías, pimientos y naranjas en la tienda local. Una sandía cuesta tres veces lo que cuesta cada pimiento. Una naranja cuesta 5 menos que lo que cuesta una sandía. Dillon es enviado a la tienda a comprar 4 sandías, 20 pimientos y 10 naranjas. ¿Cuál es la cantidad total de dinero que gastará si cada pimiento cuesta $15?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchase.

1. Let's denote the cost of a pepper as \( p \). According to the problem, \( p = 15 \) dollars.
2. The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of a pepper, so the cost of a watermelon is \( 3p \).
3. The cost of an orange is 5 dollars less than the cost of a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is \( 3p - 5 \).

Now, let's calculate the cost of each item:
- The cost of a watermelon is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.
- The cost of a pepper is \( 15 \) dollars.
- The cost of an orange is \( 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchase:
- The total cost for 4 watermelons is \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.
- The total cost for 20 peppers is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.
- The total cost for 10 oranges is \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:

To calculate the hospital's gain, we need to determine the total revenue generated from the visits and subtract the total cost of these visits.

1. **Total Revenue:**
   - The hospital treats 500 people per day.
   - Each patient is examined for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
   - The hospital charges $150 per hour to doctors.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from doctors is 500 * 0.4 * $150 = $24,000.
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour to patients.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from patients is 500 * 0.4 * $200 = $4,000.
   - The total revenue is $24,000 + $4,000 = $28,000.

2. **Total Cost:**
   - The hospital's cost is $150 per hour for doctors, and $200 per hour for patients.
   - The total cost is (500 * 0.4 * $150) + (500 * 0.4 * $200) = $28,000.

3. **Hospital's Gain:**
   - The hospital's gain is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - The hospital's gain is $28,000 - $28,000 = $0.

Therefore, the hospital's gain from these visits is $\boxed{0}$.",0,10000

Question: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in the Santa's Village department store. One third of the elves quit after the children threw up on them; then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after the children poked their tushies. How many elves are left?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 60 elves.
2. One third of them quit after the children threw up on them:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ elves quit}
   \]
   So, the number of elves left is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ elves}
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after the children poked their tushies:
   \[

Spanish translation: ¿Cuántas millas caminó Mike el miércoles?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of miles Mike walked on Wednesday. We know the following:

1. On Monday, Mike walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, Mike walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday.
3. The total distance Mike walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.

Let's denote the distance Mike walked on Wednesday as \( x \) miles.

First, calculate the distance Mike walked on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Distance on Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Distance on Monday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Distance on Monday} + \text{Distance on Tuesday} + \text{Distance on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ 4 + 24 + x = 41 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 28 + x = 41 \]
\[ x = 41 - 28 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, Mike walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

Se agrega a la cuenta un 20 % por el servicio de entrega a domicilio, y Rory quiere añadir una propina de $5,00. ¿Cuánto costará su pedido con entrega a domicilio?

Calculation:
1. Calculate the total cost of the food items:
   - Sandwiches: 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
   - Potatoes: 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
   - Cookies: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
   Total food cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

2. Calculate the service charge:
   Service charge = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

3. Add the tip:
   Tip = $5.00

4. Calculate the total cost with delivery:

We know that the total number of cars is 20, and we have the number of cars with automatic and manual transmission. Therefore, the number of cars with semi-automatic transmission is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of cars with semi-automatic transmission by dividing the number of cars with semi-automatic transmission by the total number of cars and then multiplying by 100:

mgsm-es-141,"English translation: There are 700 bees in a beehive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. How many worker bees are there?

To solve this, let's denote the number of queen bees as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the information given, we have:
1. W = 2B (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2. B = 2Q (there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees)

We also know that the total number of bees is 700:
W + B + Q = 700

Substituting the first two equations into the total number of bees equation:
2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute B in the equation:
3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now, we can find B and W:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200
W = 2B = 2 * 200 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the beehive.",400,400

To calculate the total cost with the 10% tax applied to non-food items, we first calculate the total cost of all items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Tazas: $3
- Traps for cockroaches: $4

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:

Tax = 10% of (Milk + Eggs + Light bulbs + Tazas + Traps for cockroaches)
Tax = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Finally, we add the tax to the total cost before tax to get the final total:

Total cost with tax = Total cost before tax + Tax
Total cost with tax = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

Spanish translation: Steve y Tim decidieron quién llegaría más rápido a casa después de la escuela. Steve vive más lejos de la escuela que Tim, por lo que se le permite andar en bicicleta. Steve vive a 3 millas de distancia de la escuela y puede andar en bicicleta a 440 pies por minuto. Tim vive a 2 millas de distancia de la escuela. Si Tim puede andar en patineta a 264 pies por minuto, ¿cuánto tiempo esperará el ganador en su casa antes de que el perdedor termine la carrera?

Answer: 10 minutos

Explanation: First, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach home. For Steve, the time is given by the distance divided by the speed: 3 miles / 440 feet per minute = 0.068 minutes. For Tim, the time is given by the distance divided by the speed: 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 0.076 minutes. The difference in time is 0.076 - 0.068 = 0.008 minutes, which is 0.008 * 60 = 0.48 seconds. Therefore, the winner will wait 0.48 seconds for the loser before finishing the race.",48,4
mgsm-es-151,"English translation: Shawnda decides that the children in her neighborhood really would benefit from a bicycle tire inflator service. She decides that the best way to charge for the service is by the gumball. Inflating one gumball costs 25 cents. On the first day, 5 people were riding bicycles, inflating two gumballs each. They passed 3 people who were inflating all of their tricycles. Finally, there was one person on a tandem bicycle. How many dollars did Shawnda earn that day?

To calculate the total earnings, we need to consider the number of gumballs inflated and the cost per gumball.

1. For the 5 people riding bicycles, each inflating 2 gumballs:
   \( 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ gumballs/person} = 10 \text{ gumballs} \)

2. For the 3 people inflating tricycles:
   \( 3 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ gumball/person} = 3 \text{ gumballs} \)

3. For the person on a tandem bicycle:
   \( 1 \text{ gumball} \)

Adding these together gives us the total number of gumballs inflated:
\( 10 \text{ gumballs} + 3 \text{ gumballs} + 1 \text{ gumball} = 14 \text{ gumballs} \)

Since each gumball costs 25 cents, we need to convert this to dollars:
\( 14 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.25/\text{gumball} = \$3.50 \)

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{3.50}$.",50,5
mgsm-es-152,"English translation: Carl buys ten packets of cookies. Each packet of cookies contains six cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10. How much change does Carl receive if he pays with a $10 bill?

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Cookies per packet} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cookies} \times \text{Cost per cookie} = 60 \times 0.10 = 6 \]

Finally, we calculate the change Carl receives by subtracting the total cost from the amount he paid:

Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 2 classes of 2 hours each on Tuesday and Thursday. There are 16 weeks of classes in a semester.

To calculate the total hours Kimo spends in classes in a semester, we can break it down as follows:

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.
- In total, Kimo spends 3 + 4 = 7 hours in classes on the days that are not Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester and Kimo has 3 days a week that are not Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

7 hours/week * 16 weeks = 112 hours

Therefore, the answer is 112.",112,272
mgsm-es-155,"English translation: Bill bakes 300 croissants, 120 baguettes, and 60 croissants with chocolate every day. Each croissant is 6 inches long, each baguette is 2 feet long, and each croissant with chocolate is 4 inches long. If Bill arranges all the baked goods in a row, what is their total length in feet?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then sum them up.

1. **Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 300 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants = \( 300 \times 6 \) inches.

2. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 120 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Total length of baguettes = \( 120 \times 2 \) feet.

3. **Croissants with chocolate:**
   - Bill bakes 60 croissants with chocolate.
   - Each croissant with chocolate is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants with chocolate = \( 60 \times 4 \) inches.

Now, let's convert all measurements to feet and sum them up.

1. **Total length of croissants:**
   - \( 300 \times 6 \) inches = \( 300 \times \frac{1}{12} \) feet = \( 25 \) feet.

2. **Total length of baguettes:**
   - \( 120 \times 2 \) feet = \( 240 \) feet.

3. **Total length of croissants with chocolate:**
   - \( 60 \times 4 \) inches = \( 60 \times \frac{1}{12} \) feet = \( 5 \) feet.

Finally, summing up all the lengths:

\[ \text{Total length} = 25 \text{ feet} + 240 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 270 \text{ feet} \]

Answer: The total length of all the baked goods, when arranged in a row, is \( \boxed{270} \) feet.",270,280
mgsm-es-156,"English translation: The zookeeper feeds all the primates in the zoo. He asks the local farm to give him all the bananas every 2 months. Monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, and baboons need 100 bananas per month. How many bananas does he need to ask for to cover 2 months?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months for all the primates.

For monkeys:
200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas

For gorillas:
400 bananas

For baboons:
100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the primates:
400 bananas (monkeys) + 400 bananas (gorillas) + 200 bananas (baboons) = 1000 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to ask for 1000 bananas to cover 2 months for all the primates.",2,1400

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once and then decides not to run with Blake, so she starts running until the 40-yard line and then runs back. She does this 34 times. How much farther did the winner run compared to the loser?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran and then find the difference between the two distances.

1. **Blake's distance:**
   - Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
   - Each back and forth is 100 yards.
   - Total distance for Blake = \( 15 \times 100 \) yards = \( 1500 \) yards.

2. **Kelly's distance:**
   - Kelly runs back and forth once.
   - Then she runs from the 40-yard line to the 100-yard line and back.
   - Distance from 40 to 100 yards = \( 100 - 40 = 60 \) yards.
   - Distance from 100 to 40 yards = \( 100 - 40 = 60 \) yards.
   - Total distance for Kelly = \( 60 + 60 \) yards = \( 120 \) yards.

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Difference = Blake's distance - Kelly's distance

To find out how many sea monkeys they caught, we need to calculate the number of each type of sea creature caught by both Anakin and Locsin, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of sea creature caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Seahorses: 6

Next, we calculate the number of each type of sea creature caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Seahorses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Sea monkeys: 3 + 2 = 5

Now, we sum up the number of sea monkeys caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of lemons spent by Juan and Carlos. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of gallons sold:**
   - They make 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of gallons sold.
   - Therefore, the total number of glasses sold is \( 20x \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the glasses:**
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \( 0.50 \times 20x = 10x \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar:**
   - For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) gallons is \( 3x + 2x = 5x \).

4. **Determine the profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Given that the profit is $25, we have:
     \[
     10x - 5x = 25
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     5x = 25
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{25}{5} = 5
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The total cost of lemons is \( 5x \).
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \):

2. According to the information, B = 40.
3. Monica has 4 fewer crickets than Bo, so Monica has B - 4 crickets.

Sandra had asked for four times as many red roses as white lilies. She also ordered 200 carnations, which were five times the amount of white lilies. Sandra threatened to switch suppliers if she didn't receive the red roses before 5 p. m. How many red roses must Fred deliver before 5 p. m. to save Sandra's business?

To solve this, let's denote the number of white lilies as \( x \). According to the problem:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white lilies, so the number of red roses is \( 4x \).
2. The number of carnations is five times the number of white lilies, so the number of carnations is \( 5x \).
3. The total number of flowers ordered is the sum of red roses, white lilies, and carnations, which is \( 4x + x + 5x = 10x \).

Since the total number of flowers ordered is 200, we have:
\[ 10x = 200 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4x = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{80}\) red roses before 5 p. m. to save Sandra's business.",5,160

mgsm-es-184,"English translation: Jerry rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the percentage more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two consecutive even numbers?
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events:
1. Rolling a number greater than 3.
2. Rolling two consecutive even numbers.

Let's calculate each probability step by step:

### 1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3

The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes.

The total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die is 6.

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

### 2. Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

After rolling an even number, there are 5 remaining numbers on the die. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{5} \]

So, the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is:
\[ P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{3}{10} \]

### 3. Calculating the difference in probabilities

Now, we need to find the difference in probabilities:
\[ \text{Difference} = P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{10} \]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 2 and 10 is 10:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{10} \]

So,
\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{5}{10} - \frac{3}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \]

### 4. Converting the difference to a percentage

To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage difference} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \times 100\% = 20\% \]

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 20% more likely than rolling two consecutive even numbers.",20,25

mgsm-es-186,"English translation: Russell works at a pet store and distributes straw among rodents. The rats are in 3 cages in groups of equal size, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are separated, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit pen where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. Straw is not used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

First, we know that each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. Since there are 3 cages with rats, the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is:
\[ 3r \times 6 = 18r \]

We are given that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed in total. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 18r = 160 \]

To find \( r \), we solve for \( r \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 18:
\[ r = \frac{160}{18} = \frac{80}{9} \approx 8.89 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to check if there is a mistake in the problem statement or if the number of rats per cage is not a whole number. However, based on the given information and the equation, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{8.89} \]",89,5

mgsm-es-188,"English translation: A farmer sells some sacks of wheat to a merchant for $20 per sack. Each sack costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse, and the merchant makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks at $30 each. How many sacks did the merchant sell?

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of sacks sold as \( x \).

1. The merchant buys the sacks at $20 each, so the total cost for \( x \) sacks is \( 20x \).
2. The merchant transports each sack at a cost of $2, so the total transportation cost for \( x \) sacks is \( 2x \).
3. The merchant sells each sack at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) sacks is \( 30x \).

The merchant's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
30x - (20x + 2x) = 400
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
30x - 22x = 400
\]

\[
8x = 400

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{400}{8} = 50

Answer: La suma de los costos de las entradas y las comida es de $20.25 + $4.50 = $24.75. La suma de los costos de las atracciones es de $33 x 2 = $66. Por lo tanto, el total de los costos es de $24.75 + $66 = $90.65. Si dividimos este monto entre 3 amigos, cada uno pagó $90.65 / 3 = $30.215. El resultado redondeado a dos decimales es $30.22.

2. Therefore, in 3 hours, there are \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

mgsm-es-211,"English translation: Jerry has a chicken coop. The red hens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white hens lay 5 eggs per day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If there are two more white hens than red hens, how many red hens are there?

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of red hens as \( r \) and the number of white hens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42.
2. The number of white hens is two more than the number of red hens.

We can write these as equations:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]
\[ w = r + 2 \]

Now, we substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red hens.

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then determine how long it takes to walk that distance at the given speed.

1. Calculate the perimeter of the park:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Determine the time spent walking:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

So, Gary spends $\boxed{5}$ hours walking along the edge of the park.",5,5
mgsm-es-213,"English translation: While at the store ""Everything for a Dollar,"" Sloane counts 100 customers who enter the store on the first day. The next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers at the end of the third day is 500, how many customers did she count on the third day?

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day as \( x \). According to the problem, on the second day, she counted \( x + 50 \) customers. The total number of customers at the end of the third day is the sum of the customers counted on the first, second, and third days, which is given as 500.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 50) + \text{(number of customers on the third day)} = 500 \]

Let's denote the number of customers counted on the third day as \( y \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[ x + (x + 50) + y = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 2x + 50 + y = 500 \]

To find \( y \), we need to solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 500 - 2x - 50 \]
\[ y = 450 - 2x \]

Since \( x \) is the number of customers counted on the first day, and the problem states that the number of customers counted on the first day is 100, we can substitute \( x = 100 \) into the equation:
\[ y = 450 - 2(100) \]
\[ y = 450 - 200 \]
\[ y = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \( \boxed{250} \).",250,250

To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we first calculate the total cost of the shoes and belt:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of shoes} + \text{Cost of belt} = 3200 + 320 = 3520
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $3520. Since she earns $8 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12 months and then subtract this from the original loan amount.

1. Calculate the interest on the loan:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:

3. Subtract the total payment from the original loan amount to find the remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Balance} = 2000 - 2200 = -200

polymath-low-es-86,"Primero, vamos a traducir la pregunta al inglés:

Greg has set an alarm that goes off three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it keeps going off until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it went off four times. The second time it went off, it went off three times more than the first time. The third time, it went off half the time of the second time. How many times did the alarm go off in total?

Ahora, vamos a responder en español:

Greg ha configurado una alarma que se activa tres veces al día como recordatorio. Cuando suena la alarma, sigue sonando hasta que Greg la apaga. La primera vez que se activó hoy, sonó cuatro veces. La segunda vez que se activó, sonó tres veces más que la primera vez. La tercera vez, sonó la mitad del tiempo de la segunda vez. ¿Cuántas veces sonó la alarma en total?

Para responder a esta pregunta, necesitamos calcular la cantidad total de veces que la alarma sonó. Vamos a hacerlo paso a paso:

1. La primera vez que sonó la alarma fue cuatro veces.
2. La segunda vez que sonó la alarma fue tres veces más que la primera, es decir, 4 + 3 = 7 veces.
3. La tercera vez que sonó la alarma fue la mitad del tiempo de la segunda, es decir, 7 / 2 = 3.5 veces. Como la cantidad de veces que una alarma puede sonar es un número entero, debemos tomar la parte entera de 3.5, que es 3.

Por lo tanto, la alarma sonó una cantidad total de 4 + 7 + 3 = 14 veces.

La respuesta en inglés sería: ""The alarm went off 14 times in total.""

La respuesta en español sería: ""La alarma sonó 14 veces en total.""

Por lo tanto, la respuesta final es: $\boxed{14}$",14,22

polymath-low-es-88,"English translation: The first album by Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as the one by Harald. If together they sold 88,000 copies, how many copies did Harald sell?

Spanish translation: El primer disco de Marilyn vendió 10 veces más copias que el de Harald. Si juntos vendieron 88 000, ¿cuántas copias vendió Harald?

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of copies sold by Marilyn as \( M \) and the number of copies sold by Harald as \( H \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ M = 10H \]

And the total number of copies sold together is:

\[ M + H = 88,000 \]

Substituting \( M \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 10H + H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his album.

polymath-low-es-92,"English translation: Emily has 4 children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?

To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent the age of Jackson.
2. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
4. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 10 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and \( J + 7 = J + 10 \), we can solve for \( J \):

\[ J + 7 = J + 10 \]
\[ 7 = 10 \]

This equation is incorrect, which means there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the information:

- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.

From the third point, we know Corey's age is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age:

\[ \text{Jackson's age} = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is that Jackson is 4 years old.",4,4

Of the 200 fifth-grade students, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls belong to the Girl Explorer group. How many girls are not in the Girl Explorer group?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boys.
2. Calculate the number of girls.
3. Calculate the number of girls in the Girl Explorer group.
4. Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Explorer group from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the Girl Explorer group.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Calculate the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{2 \times 200}{5} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
   \]

2. Calculate the number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

3. Calculate the number of girls in the Girl Explorer group:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in Girl Explorer group} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{2 \times 120}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
   \]

4. Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Explorer group from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the Girl Explorer group:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in Girl Explorer group} = 120 - 80 = 40

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of the time Harry slept, we can calculate this as follows:

James' sleep hours = Harry's sleep hours * (2/3)
James' sleep hours = 9 hours * (2/3)

Now, let's calculate the exact number of hours James slept:

James' sleep hours = 9 * (2/3) = 6 hours

Now that we know James slept 6 hours, we can find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:

More hours Harry slept = Harry's sleep hours - James' sleep hours
More hours Harry slept = 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 hours more than James.",3,3

polymath-low-es-106,"English translation: John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total interior volume of the 3 boxes?
To calculate the total interior volume of the 3 boxes, we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes. The volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height.

First, let's calculate the total volume of the 3 boxes:
\[ \text{Total volume of 3 boxes} = 3 \times (5 \times 6 \times 4) \]

Next, we need to calculate the volume of the walls. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes.

The volume of the walls can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Volume of walls} = 3 \times (5 \times 6 \times 1) \times 2 \]
This is because there are 2 pairs of walls (length and width, and width and height).

Finally, we subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes to get the total interior volume:
\[ \text{Total interior volume} = \text{Total volume of 3 boxes} - \text{Volume of walls} \]

Let's calculate this step by step.

1. Calculate the total volume of the 3 boxes:
\[ \text{Total volume of 3 boxes} = 3 \times (5 \times 6 \times 4) = 3 \times 120 = 360 \text{ cubic inches} \]

2. Calculate the volume of the walls:
\[ \text{Volume of walls} = 3 \times (5 \times 6 \times 1) \times 2 = 3 \times 30 \times 2 = 180 \text{ cubic inches} \]

3. Calculate the total interior volume:
\[ \text{Total interior volume} = 360 - 180 = 180 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total interior volume of the 3 boxes is $\boxed{180}$ cubic inches.",180,72

Cuando las pone a enfriar, descarta 5 de las galletas y ahora tiene un total de 110 galletas. ¿Cuántas galletas horneó Henry el año pasado?

Answer: Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). According to the problem, he baked \( 2x \) cookies this year. When he baked, he baked 15 more cookies than he wanted, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he discarded 5 cookies, so he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies. After discarding 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Unfortunately, one of them made a mistake, and Beatrice was two roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, while Marcel was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. If both ate their full amount, how many did they eat on average?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups they ate and then divide by 2 to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice was 24 roll-ups long.
- Beatrice was 3 roll-ups wide.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(24 \times 3 = 72\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of roll-ups Marcel ate:
- Marcel was 14 roll-ups long.
- Marcel was 3 roll-ups wide.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcel ate is \(14 \times 3 = 42\).

Now, let's find the total number of roll-ups they ate together:
- The total number of roll-ups they ate together is \(72 + 42 = 114\).

Finally, let's calculate the average number of roll-ups they ate:
- The average number of roll-ups they ate is \(\frac{114}{2} = 57\).

polymath-low-es-118,"English Translation: A customs officer at the main customs port counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. The next day, they brought more containers, and the total number of vehicles in the port became 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming each container has 5 vehicles.

Answer in Spanish: Suponiendo que todos los contenedores tengan 5 vehículos, la cantidad de contenedores que se importaron el segundo día es $\boxed{3}$.

Explanation: 
- Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, totaling 10 vehicles.
- After the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30.
- Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20.
- Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.
- However, since the question asks for the number of containers, and we have 2 containers initially, we need to subtract the initial containers from the total number of containers imported on the second day.
- So, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4 - 2 = 3.",3,4
polymath-low-es-119,"English translation: Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased by 40% more than what he had earned four years ago. If their salaries increased at the same rate and four years ago Adrien earned $40,000, calculate the total salary they received four years later.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
4. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
5. Sum their salaries four years later.

Let's start with step 1:

Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000

Step 2:
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + 40% of $40,000
= $40,000 + 0.40 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $16,000
= $56,000

Step 3:
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / 1.30 (since it was 30% higher than Adrien's)
= $30,769.23 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 4:
Lylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + 40% of $30,769.23
= $30,769.23 + 0.40 * $30,769.23
= $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
= $43,076.92 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 5:
Total salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
= $56,000 + $43,076.92
= $99,076.92

Therefore, the total salary that Adrien and Lylah received four years later is $\boxed{99076.92}$.",92,95200
polymath-low-es-120,"English translation: Miguel uses 2 notebooks per week for his drawings. If one notebook has 30 pages, how many pages does he use each month?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Miguel uses in a month. We know that he uses 2 notebooks per week, and each notebook has 30 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages used in a week and then multiply by 4 to get the total for a month.

First, calculate the total number of pages used in a week:
\[ \text{Pages per week} = 2 \text{ notebooks} \times 30 \text{ pages per notebook} = 60 \text{ pages} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pages used in a month (4 weeks):
\[ \text{Pages per month} = 60 \text{ pages per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks per month} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, Miguel uses $\boxed{240}$ pages each month.",240,240

polymath-low-es-122,"English translation: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day because she had to finish some tasks. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total for the entire week?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Sadie slept during the week.

1. **Monday:**
   - Hours slept: 8 hours

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - Hours slept each day: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
   - Total for Tuesday and Wednesday: 6 hours/day * 2 days = 12 hours

3. **Thursday:**
   - Hours slept: 6 + 1 = 7 hours

4. **Friday:**
   - Hours slept: 7 + 1 = 8 hours

5. **Saturday:**
   - Hours slept: 8 + 1 = 9 hours

6. **Sunday:**
   - Hours slept: 9 + 1 = 10 hours

Now, we sum up all the hours slept during the week:

\[
8 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 8 \text{ (Friday)} + 9 \text{ (Saturday)} + 10 \text{ (Sunday)}
\]

\[
8 + 12 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 54

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of $\boxed{54}$ hours in the entire week.",54,48
