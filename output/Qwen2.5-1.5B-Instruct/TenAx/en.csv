mgsm-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the blue ties.
2. Determine the number of red ties John buys.
3. Calculate the cost of the red ties.
4. Sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total amount spent.

First, we calculate the cost of the blue ties. John bought blue ties that cost $40 each and he spent $200 on them. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Next, we determine the number of red ties John buys. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]
red ties.

Now, we calculate the cost of the red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the red ties cost:
\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
So, each red tie costs $60. Therefore, the total cost of the red ties is:
\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]
Finally, we sum the costs of the blue and red ties to find the total amount spent:
\[
200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

mgsm-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
2. Convert the daily egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the daily revenue from selling the eggs.
4. Calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days in a week.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs produced per day:**
   \[
   \text{Number of eggs per day} = 252 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Convert the daily egg production into dozens:**
   Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the number of eggs by 12:
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily revenue from selling the eggs:**
   Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by $2:
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue} = 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars per dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days in a week:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily revenue by 7:
   \[
   \text{Weekly revenue} = 42 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 294 \text{ dollars}

1. **Calculate the number of days in the first 180 days:**
   \[
   180 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days in the remaining part of the year:**
   Since a year has 365 days, the remaining days are:
   \[
   365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, so:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:**
   The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days, so:

mgsm-en-77,"To find the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do, we start by determining how much laundry each person does based on the given information.

1. **Determine how much laundry Sarah does:**
   Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine how much laundry David does:**
   Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
   \]
   Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
   \]
   To find David's laundry, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine how much laundry Raymond does:**
   Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry}
   \]
   Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we substitute this value into the equation:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   \[
   24 \text{ fries}
   \]

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   \[
   5 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Fries left after Kyle and Billy took their shares:**
   \[
   24 - 5 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( G \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving these fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + G \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]

7. **Fries left after Colby took his share:**
   \[
   (9 + G) - 2 = 7 + G \text{ fries}
   \]

8. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin ended up with 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + G = 27
   \]

9. **Solving for \( G \):**
   \[
   G = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Thus, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries.",20,20

The total number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the total number of snails in the second aquarium is 32. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{14}\).",14,7

\[ S_w = 4S_m \]

Given that \( S_m = 5 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ S_w = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so we have:

\[ S_w' = 2S_m' \]

Given that \( S_m' = 13 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ S_w' = 2 \times 13 = 26 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate over the two days:

- Total cookies eaten by Sue: \( S_w + S_w' = 20 + 26 = 46 \)
- Total cookies eaten by her sister: \( S_m + S_m' = 5 + 13 = 18 \)

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories consumed by each and then find the difference:

- Calories consumed by Sue: \( 46 \times 200 \)
- Calories consumed by her sister: \( 18 \times 200 \)

Now, let's calculate the total calories:

- Calories consumed by Sue: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \)
- Calories consumed by her sister: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \)

Finally, let's find the difference in calories:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

First, let's find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. The increase in value due to the repairs is 150% of the original value.

The increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.50 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house after the repairs. This is the original value of the house plus the cost of the repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

polymath-low-en-4,"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon.
2. Subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available to find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

First, let's find out how much feed is given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed, and she has 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed, and she has 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed given in the afternoon is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we add the amounts of feed given in the morning and afternoon to find the total amount of feed given to the chickens in these two meals:
\[
60 \text{ cups} + 60 \text{ cups} = 120 \text{ cups}
\]

Since Wendi has a total of 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, the total amount of feed available is:
\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available to find out how much feed is left for the final meal:
\[
40 \text{ cups} - 120 \text{ cups} = -80 \text{ cups}
\]

Since the result is negative, it means that Wendi does not have enough feed to give the chickens in the final meal. Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

polymath-low-en-5,"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and each subsequent glass costs 60% of the price of the previous glass.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the second glass, which is 60% of the cost of the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the third glass, which is 60% of the cost of the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the third glass} = 0.60 \times 3 = \$1.80 \]

We continue this process for each subsequent glass. The cost of the \( n \)-th glass can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost of the } n\text{-th glass} = 5 \times (0.60)^{n-1} \]

To find the total cost for 16 glasses, we sum the costs of all 16 glasses:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 3 + 1.80 + 1.08 + 0.648 + 0.3888 + 0.23328 + 0.140208 + 0.0841248 + 0.04206784 + 0.021034688 + 0.010517344 + 0.005258672 + 0.002629336 + 0.001314668 + 0.000657334 \]

Adding these values together:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 3 + 1.80 + 1.08 + 0.648 + 0.3888 + 0.23328 + 0.140208 + 0.0841248 + 0.04206784 + 0.021034688 + 0.010517344 + 0.005258672 + 0.002629336 + 0.001314668 + 0.000657334 \]

First, let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \). According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep:
\[
S = 20
\]

Next, we know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston, \( C \), can be calculated as:
\[
C = 4S
\]
Substituting the value of \( S \):
\[
C = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse, \( T \), can be calculated as:
\[
T = 2C
\]
Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[
T = 2 \times 80 = 160
\]

To find the total number of sheep among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city:
\[
T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20

Adding these values together:
\[
160 + 80 + 20 = 260

First, let's calculate the time it takes Carla to download the first 80% of the file before the restart.

1. Calculate the time to download the first 80% of the file:
   - The file is 200 GB, so 80% of the file is \(0.8 \times 200 = 160\) GB.
   - Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so the time to download 160 GB is \(\frac{160 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 80\) minutes.

2. Calculate the time to download the remaining 20% of the file after the restart:
   - The remaining 20% of the file is \(0.2 \times 200 = 40\) GB.
   - Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so the time to download 40 GB is \(\frac{40 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 20\) minutes.

3. Add the time to download the first 80% and the time to download the remaining 20%:

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives the remaining time of the 4 hours at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Time remaining after the first 5 hours (3 hours + 2 hours + 0.5 hours):
     \[

1. Calculate the earnings for the first 40 hours:
   Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. Therefore, her earnings for the first 40 hours are:
   \[
   40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the earnings for the overtime hours:
   Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (since she worked a total of 45 hours). Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 1.2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
   However, the problem states that the number of downloads in the second month was reduced by 30% in the third month. This means the actual number of downloads in the second month is:
   \[
   180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% of the number of downloads in the second month. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   0.30 \times 126 = 37.8
   \]
   Since the number of downloads must be a whole number, we round 37.8 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   Now, we sum the number of downloads from all three months:

- Therefore, the total cost for the donuts is:
  \[
  3 \text{ dozen} \times 68 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 204 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
  \[
  2 \text{ dozen} \times 80 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 160 \text{ dollars}

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it will take to accumulate a profit of $90.

First, let's calculate the annual profit from selling the lemons. The tree grows 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue from selling the lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, we need to subtract the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree. The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3. Therefore, the net profit per year is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for Carlos to accumulate a profit of $90. We do this by dividing the total profit needed by the net profit per year:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

Thus, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13
polymath-low-en-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 1 \]

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 1 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 6 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 2x = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 9 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with \(\boxed{9}\) vacuum cleaners.",9,18

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[ \text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 + 0.025 \times 5000 = 5000 + 125 = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a 1.2% increase:
\[ \text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 8000 + 0.012 \times 8000 = 8000 + 96 = 8096 \]

Now, we compare the two values to determine the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Value of jewelry after increase} - \text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 5125 - 8096 = -2971 \]

The negative value indicates a loss. Therefore, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the jewelry purchase plan is:

\[
\text{Cost of chicken meal} = \$12
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the 5 packs of milk:
\[
\text{Cost of milk} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15
\]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the 4 apples:
\[

This implies:

\[ D = \frac{7}{11} A \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162:

\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11} A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \), we get:

\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

To solve for \( A \), we multiply both sides by 11:

\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]

\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 18:

\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]

\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

First, let's find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. The increase in value is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:

Next, we need to find the total cost of the house after the repairs. The total cost is the sum of the original value of the house and the cost of the repairs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon.
2. Subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available to find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

First, let's find out how much feed is given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed, and there are 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed, and there are 20 chickens. So, the total amount of feed given in the afternoon is:
  \[
  3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we add the amounts of feed given in the morning and afternoon to find the total amount of feed given in the first two meals:
\[
60 \text{ cups} + 60 \text{ cups} = 120 \text{ cups}
\]

Since Wendi has a total of 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, the total amount of feed available is:
\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available to find out how much feed is left for the final meal:
\[
40 \text{ cups} - 120 \text{ cups} = -80 \text{ cups}

Since the result is negative, it means that Wendi does not have enough feed to give the chickens in the final meal. Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

mgsm-en-5,"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and each subsequent glass costs 60% of the price of the previous glass.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the third glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the third glass} = 3 \times 0.60 = 1.80 \]

We can see that each subsequent glass costs 60% of the previous glass. Therefore, the cost of the \(n\)-th glass can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost of the } n\text{-th glass} = 5 \times (0.60)^{n-1} \]

To find the total cost for 16 glasses, we sum the costs of each individual glass:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 3 + 1.80 + 1.08 + \cdots + 5 \times (0.60)^{15} \]

This is a geometric series where the first term \(a = 5\) and the common ratio \(r = 0.60\). The sum of the first 16 terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ S_{16} = 5 \frac{1-(0.60)^{16}}{1-0.60} = 5 \frac{1-(0.60)^{16}}{0.40} = 5 \times 2.5 \frac{1-(0.60)^{16}}{1} = 12.5 \left(1 - (0.60)^{16}\right) \]

Now, we need to calculate \((0.60)^{16}\):
\[ (0.60)^{16} \approx 0.000531441 \]

Substituting this value back into the sum formula:
\[ S_{16} = 12.5 \left(1 - 0.000531441\right) = 12.5 \times 0.999468559 \approx 12.4933566675 \]

3. \( S = 20 \) (Seattle has 20 sheep)

First, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston. Using the second relationship:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we use the first relationship to find the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[ T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is \(\boxed{260}\).",260,260
mgsm-en-7,"To determine how long it takes Carla to download the 200 GB file after the restart, we need to break the problem into two parts: the time it takes to download the first 80% of the file and the time it takes to download the remaining 20% of the file after the restart.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 80% of the file before the restart. The file is 200 GB, so 80% of the file is:
\[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.80 = 160 \text{ GB} \]
Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so the time to download 160 GB is:
\[ \frac{160 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the 20-minute restart. After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 20% of the file, which is:
\[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.20 = 40 \text{ GB} \]
The time to download 40 GB at a rate of 2 GB per minute is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time to download the first 80% of the file and the time to download the remaining 20% of the file after the restart, we get:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is:

mgsm-en-9,"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and her overtime earnings separately, and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the earnings for the first 40 hours:
   Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. Therefore, her earnings for the first 40 hours are:
   \[
   40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the overtime earnings:
   Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so the number of overtime hours is:
   \[
   45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay rate is:

First, let's calculate the net profit per year. The tree grows 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue from selling lemons each year is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, we need to account for the cost of watering and feeding the tree each year, which is $3. Therefore, the net profit per year is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to accumulate a net profit of at least $90. We do this by dividing the total amount of money needed by the net profit per year:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is \( \frac{x}{3} \). Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. After selling at the red house, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)

4. According to the problem, after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

   Then, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 3/2:
   \[
   x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
- Growth rate: 2.5% = 0.025
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:

mgsm-en-30,"Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write:

\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:

\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162:

\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \), we get:

\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we have:

\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]

\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

To solve for \( A \), we multiply both sides by 11:

\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]

\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 18:

\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]

\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99 years. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[ A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
mgsm-en-31,"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the guesses of all three friends and then find the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 80 plus 20 is 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends to find the average:

\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

So, the average guess is $\boxed{80}$.",80,80
mgsm-en-32,"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends walking and taking care of dogs each day.
2. Multiply that daily total by the number of days in a week to get the weekly total.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total number of hours spent on dogs each day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on dogs in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week is \(\boxed{35}\).",35,35
mgsm-en-33,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final answer is:

mgsm-en-37,"To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets.
2. Determine how much money John had after buying the video games.
3. Calculate the total number of Lego sets John originally had.
4. Subtract the number of Lego sets he used to buy the video games from the total number of Lego sets he originally had.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ Lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per Lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's determine how much money John had after buying the video games. We know that after buying 8 video games for $20 each, he has $5 left. So, the total amount of money he had before buying the video games is:
\[ \$20 \times 8 + \$5 = \$160 + \$5 = \$165 \]

Now, we know that John originally had $195 from selling the Lego sets. After buying the video games, he has $5 left. Therefore, the total amount of money he had before buying the video games is:
\[ \$195 + \$5 = \$200 \]

This means that the total number of Lego sets John originally had is:
\[ \$200 \div \$15 = \frac{200}{15} = \frac{40}{3} = 13 \frac{1}{3} \]

Since John can't have a fraction of a Lego set, we need to consider that he sold 13 Lego sets and had some left over. The total number of Lego sets he originally had is 13, and he sold 13 Lego sets, so he has:
\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \text{ Lego sets left} \]

However, the problem states that he sold 13 Lego sets, so he must have had 13 Lego sets originally and sold 13 Lego sets, leaving him with 0 Lego sets. But the problem also states he has $5 left, which means he must have had 14 Lego sets originally. So, he must have had 14 Lego sets originally and sold 13 Lego sets, leaving him with:
\[ 14 - 13 = 1 \text{ Lego set left} \]

Therefore, the number of Lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]",1,2
mgsm-en-38,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total time he spends running each week and then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week. John runs 3 days a week, and he runs for 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Therefore, he runs for:

\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time on the third day} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time John spends running each week is:

\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, the speed at which John runs is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10
mgsm-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. Let's start by finding Dana's walking speed.

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour and that skipping is half as fast as running, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
\[
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we know that Dana can run at a rate of four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[
\text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent running and walking as follows:
\[
\text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance Dana travels during these times. The distance traveled while running is:
\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
The distance traveled while walking is:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana travels in six hours:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

2. Determine the increased throwing distance when Polly holds the gemstone.
3. Calculate the new throwing distance with the gemstone.

Step 1: Identify the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin without the gemstone.
Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet.

Step 2: Determine the increased throwing distance when Polly holds the gemstone.
When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when she does not hold the gemstone. Therefore, the increased throwing distance is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Step 3: Calculate the new throwing distance with the gemstone.
The new throwing distance with the gemstone is 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames are within a distance of 1000 feet, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she holds the gemstone.

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you can consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on the remaining calories.

First, calculate the total number of calories in the bag of chips:
\[ \text{Total calories} = \text{Calories per serving} \times \text{Number of servings} = 250 \times 5 = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, determine how many calories you can consume without exceeding your daily calorie target. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = \text{Daily calorie target} - \text{Calories already consumed} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories. Since each serving of chips has 250 calories:
\[ \text{Number of servings you can eat} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of grams of chips you can eat:
\[ \text{Total grams} = \text{Number of servings} \times \text{Grams per serving} = 0.8 \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams} \]

mgsm-en-45,"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, we calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:

\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:

mgsm-en-46,"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to account for the total number of Post-it notes she had initially, the number she used at work, and the number she had left over.

First, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package and before she placed any on the cups of coffee. She initially had 80 Post-it notes and had 23 left over after placing one on each of 220 cups of coffee. Therefore, the number of Post-it notes she used at work is:

\[220 - 1 = 219\]

Adding the initial 80 Post-it notes and the 219 used at work, the total number of Post-it notes before the purchase is:

\[80 + 219 = 299\]

Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased. After purchasing the package, the total number of Post-it notes she had is:

\[299 + x\]

We know that after placing one Post-it note on each of the 220 cups of coffee, she had 23 Post-it notes left. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had after the purchase is also equal to the number of Post-it notes she had initially minus the 23 she had left over:

\[299 + x = 80 - 23\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[299 + x = 57\]

To find \( x \), we subtract 299 from both sides of the equation:

\[x = 57 - 299\]
\[x = -242\]

Since the number of Post-it notes in the package cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the number of Post-it notes in the package must be positive. Therefore, the correct equation should be:

\[299 + x = 80 + 23\]
\[299 + x = 103\]

Subtracting 299 from both sides, we get:

\[x = 103 - 299\]
\[x = -196\]

Again, the number of Post-it notes in the package cannot be negative, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the number of Post-it notes in the package must be positive. Therefore, the correct equation should be:

\[299 + x = 80 + 23\]
\[299 + x = 103\]

Subtracting 299 from both sides, we get:

\[x = 103 - 299\]
\[x = -196\]

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's determine how much money John had after buying the video games. We know that he bought 8 video games for $20 each and had $5 left after the purchase. So, the total amount spent on video games is:

\[ \$195 - \$165 = \$30 \]
This means that John had $30 left from selling the Lego sets. Since each Lego set was sold for $15, the number of Lego sets he still has is:

Thus, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10
polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the distances she covers while running and walking.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
\[
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is:
\[
\text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[
\text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
The time spent walking is:
\[
\text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana covers while running and walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[
\text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone:
   \[
   B_B = 4 \times B_E
   \]
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone:
   \[
   B_E = 2 \times B_S
   \]
3. Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old:
   \[
   B_S = 1
   \]

First, substitute \( B_S = 1 \) into the second equation to find \( B_E \):
\[
B_E = 2 \times B_S = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

Next, substitute \( B_E = 2 \) into the first equation to find \( B_B \):

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin without the gemstone.
2. Determine the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin with the gemstone.
3. Calculate the additional distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone beyond her initial distance.

First, we know that Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far Polly can stand outside of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the javelin, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand \(\boxed{200}\) feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.",200,200

polymath-low-en-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat with your daily calorie target, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the entire bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you have left after consuming 1800 calories.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.

First, we calculate the total number of calories in the entire bag of chips. Since each serving has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in the bag, the total number of calories is:
\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we determine how many calories you have left after consuming 1800 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the number of calories left is:
\[ 1800 \text{ calories} - 1250 \text{ calories} = 550 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 550 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, the number of grams you can eat is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/gram}} = 2.2 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is \(\boxed{2.2}\).",2,48

1. Calculate the total number of candles Charlie can make with 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles.**

Charlie can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax and wicks. If he uses 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks, he can make:
\[ 20 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ candles per pound} = 200 \text{ candles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**

If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks.**

The cost of supplies for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 20 pounds is:
\[ 20 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$200.00 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.**

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$200.00 = -\$160.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{-160}\).",-160,20
polymath-low-en-45,"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day.

1. **Monday:**
   Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   She wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is:
   \[
   5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26
\]

Now, we calculate the total time spent writing these articles. Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total time spent is:

Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) post-it notes. At work, she placed one post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, so she used up 220 post-it notes. After placing the post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the equation representing the situation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

To find \( x \), we add 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163
polymath-low-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the blue ties. John bought blue ties that cost $40 each and he spent $200 on them. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Next, we need to find out how many red ties John bought. According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]
So, John bought 10 red ties.

Now, we need to determine the cost of the red ties. The problem states that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of one red tie is:
\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Therefore, the cost of 10 red ties is:
\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]
So, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate 3/4 of 120:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Now, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the number of eggs produced per week.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs per week.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Lloyd makes by selling these eggs. Since he sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, we first need to determine how many dozens of eggs he has. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens of eggs is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, we can calculate the revenue by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Lloyd makes on eggs per week is:

polymath-low-en-51,"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back from 4 PM to 12 PM, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM. The distance between 1 PM and 4 PM is 3 hours. Since Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour, the time taken to travel this distance is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{10 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.3 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to travel from 4 PM to 12 PM. The distance between 4 PM and 12 PM is 8 hours. Since Tom's ship travels at 6 miles per hour, the time taken to travel this distance is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times for both legs of the journey:
\[
0.3 \text{ hours} + \frac{4}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

To add these times, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 0.3 and \(\frac{4}{3}\) is 3. Converting 0.3 to a fraction with a denominator of 3, we get:
\[
0.3 = \frac{3}{10}
\]

So, the total time is:
\[
\frac{3}{10} + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{3}{10} + \frac{40}{30} = \frac{9}{30} + \frac{40}{30} = \frac{49}{30} \text{ hours}

polymath-low-en-52,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he is removing. Each comic book weighs \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound, and he is removing 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, the remaining weight after removing the comic books must be:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many toys he needs to remove to reach this remaining weight. Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. Let \(x\) be the number of toys he needs to remove. The total weight of the toys he removes is:

\[
x \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \text{ pounds}
\]

We know that the total weight of the remaining items (comic books and toys) must be 7.5 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
7.5 = \frac{x}{2}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
7.5 \times 2 = x

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and charges $60 per truck tire.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires and charges $40 per car tire.
- The total revenue for Thursday is:
  \[
  6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} + 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = 6 \times 60 + 4 \times 40 = 360 + 160 = \$520

Initially, she receives an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years. After that, starting in her 21st year, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year.

First, we calculate the value of her pension at the end of 20 years:
\[
\text{Pension value at the end of 20 years} = 50,000 \times 20 = 1,000,000
\]

After 20 years, Marcy starts receiving a 5% annual pension. The value of her pension at the end of 20 years is $1,000,000, so her annual pension from the 21st year onwards is:
\[
\text{Annual pension from the 21st year onwards} = 1,000,000 \times 0.05 = 50,000

- Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day on the weekdays.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students per weekday class is 15, and she teaches 5 classes each day, so the number of students per weekday is:
\[ 15 \text{ students/class} \times 5 \text{ classes/day} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of students she teaches on weekdays in one week is:

Let's denote the square footage of the top level as \( A_4 = 16 \).

The square footage of the next level (level 3) will be:
\[ A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

The square footage of the next level (level 2) will be:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 3.5 \text{ hours} = 3.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute show is equivalent to 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total time by 0.5:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 7 \text{ episodes} \]

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:

mgsm-en-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). According to the problem, he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so he has \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left. We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 50
\]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50

mgsm-en-110,"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Beatrice ate. Beatrice's roll-ups are 24 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is:
\[
24 \times 24 = 576
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Marcell ate. Marcell's roll-ups are 14 rolls wide and 3 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is:
\[
14 \times 3 = 42
\]

Now, we can find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice by adding the two amounts together:
\[
576 + 42 = 618
\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:
\[

1. Calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water.
2. Determine the total distance the boat rowed.
3. Calculate the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the boat takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which the boat is taking on water is:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total distance the boat rowed. The boat rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, and it took 64 seconds to reach the shore. Therefore, the total distance rowed is:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 20 \text{ feet} + 64 \text{ feet} = 84 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by the boat. Since the boat takes on 0.2 liters of water per foot, the total amount of water taken on is:
\[
\text{Total water} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 84 \text{ feet} = 16.8 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore is:

First, we calculate the total number of lessons per day for all 4 teachers:
\[
4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day. Since each lesson results in 3 cleanings, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
\[
8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day}

Therefore, the number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
mgsm-en-114,"To determine how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 6B = 1800 \).

2. **Solve for \( B \):**
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

3. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 50x = 300 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

   So, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 6.

5. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The problem does not provide a direct relationship between the number of birds and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - However, if we assume that the number of ducks is proportional to the number of birds in the photograph, we can infer that the number of ducks is also 6.

mgsm-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Sasha also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the lumber:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- Sasha sells ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Sasha also sells five 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each.
  \[
  \text{Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding these revenues together gives the total revenue from selling the lumber:
  \[

Thus, Sasha's profit is \(\boxed{0}\).",0,90
mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar by \( S \) and the number of cups of water by \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ S : W = 7 : 13 \]

We are given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can express the number of cups of water in terms of the number of teaspoons of sugar. Let's assume \( S = 7x \) and \( W = 13x \). Then, we have:
\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by substituting \( x \) back into the expression for \( S \):
\[ S = 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

mgsm-en-118,"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we start by calculating the total number of vehicles imported on the first day. According to the problem, there were 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is the difference between the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day and the total number of vehicles imported on the first day. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as \( x \). Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is:

\[ 5x \]

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is the sum of the vehicles imported on the first day and the vehicles imported on the second day. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 10 + 5x = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 5x = 30 - 10 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4

   Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. To find his new salary, we calculate 40% of $40000 and add it to his original salary.
   \[
   \text{Increase in salary} = 0.40 \times 40000 = 16000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 16000 = 56000
   \]

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was 70% of Adrien's salary four years ago.
   \[
   \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = 0.70 \times 40000 = 28000
   \]

4. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Lylah's salary increased by 40% four years later. To find her new salary, we calculate 40% of $28000 and add it to her original salary.
   \[
   \text{Increase in salary} = 0.40 \times 28000 = 11200

First, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first 3 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hours are left for her to run at 5 miles per hour. Since she runs for a total of 7 hours, the time spent running at 5 miles per hour is:
\[
\text{Time}_2 = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}

1. Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total number of miles Walt walked from Monday to Wednesday.
3. Find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of miles Walt walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Let \( x \) be the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday. The total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday can be expressed as:
\[ 4 + 24 + x = 41 \]

We can simplify this equation to find \( x \):
\[ 28 + x = 41 \]
\[ x = 41 - 28 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

1. Identify the total number of cars available for rent.
2. Determine the number of semi-automatic cars.
3. Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.

First, we know the total number of cars available for rent is 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic cars and 4 are manual cars. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars can be found by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4
\]

Next, we need to find what percentage 4 semi-automatic cars are of the total 20 cars. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the known values into the formula, we get:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%

The total number of bees is the sum of the number of queens, babies, and worker bees. This gives us the equation:
\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7q = 700 \]
To find \( q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of worker bees is \( 4q \), so we substitute \( q = 100 \) into the expression:

2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples in the field. John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples is:
\[
10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}
\]

Next, we determine how many harvests John can make in a year. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[

According to the problem, the cost of one child ticket is $10 and the cost of one adult ticket is $12. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket, and she receives $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the sum of the cost of the child ticket, the cost of the adult ticket, and the change she received.

We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Since 5 people came to get their bicycles inflated, the total cost for the bicycles is:
\[ 5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the cost to inflate one tricycle's tires is:
\[ 3 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 75 \text{ cents} \]

Since 3 people came to get their tricycles inflated, the total cost for the tricycles is:
\[ 3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents} \]

3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so the number of fries left after the pigeons ate is \( x - 21 - 3 \times 3 = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the number of fries stolen by the raccoon is \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \). Thus, the number of fries left after the raccoon stole some is \( (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = (x - 30) \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = (x - 30) \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

- Therefore, the total length of the chocolate croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods:

mgsm-en-157,"To determine how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we first need to calculate the distance each person runs.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the field is 100 yards long, each back and forth run is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
So, the distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth 34 times. Each back and forth run is 100 yards, so the distance for 34 runs is:
\[ 34 \times 100 \text{ yards} = 3400 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances:
\[ \text{Distance Blake runs} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]
\[ \text{Distance Kelly runs} = 3400 \text{ yards} \]

The difference in distance is:
\[ 3400 \text{ yards} - 3000 \text{ yards} = 400 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{400}\) yards farther than the loser.",400,80

First, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - After the first two months, the price increases by 20% of $20.
   - After the next two months (four months total), the price increases by 20% of the new price.
   - This pattern continues every two months.

We can express the price after \( n \) two-month periods as:
\[ \text{Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^n \]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we substitute \( n = 18 \) into the formula:
\[ \text{Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.0663 \]

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \text{Price} = 20 \times 10.0663 = 201.326 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price is:

1. Identify the cost of each type of toy.
2. Calculate the total value of each type of toy.
3. Sum the values to get the total worth of all the toys.

First, we know the cost of the doll is equal to the cost of 3 action figures and one red car. We are given that one red car costs $4 and one action figure costs $5. Therefore, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
Adding the cost of one red car, the total cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 + 4 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total value of the action figures. There are 3 action figures, so their total value is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The total value of the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the values of all the toys:

\[
\text{Missed income} = 35 \times (h - 3)
\]

The total income from doing the taxes herself is:

\[
\text{Total income} = 35 \times h
\]

The total income from hiring the accountant is:

\[
\text{Total income with accountant} = 90

1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[
(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, we need to find the total time for both peeling and cutting one potato:
- Total time for one potato = Time to peel + Time to cut
- Total time for one potato = 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds

To add these times, we need to convert 1.5 minutes into seconds:

\[ J = M + 2 \]

Next, we are told that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. Two years ago, Jean's age was \( J - 2 \) and Mark's age was \( M - 2 \). According to the problem, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years older than half of Jean's age, so we can write:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2) + 5 \]

Now, we substitute \( J = M + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(M + 2 - 2) + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}M + 5 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(M - 2) = M + 10 \]
\[ 2M - 4 = M + 10 \]

Next, we solve for \( M \) by isolating \( M \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 2M - M = 10 + 4 \]
\[ M = 14 \]

Now that we know Mark's current age is 14, we can find Jean's current age using the equation \( J = M + 2 \):

mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
After rolling an even number on the first roll, there are now 5 numbers left on the die, with 2 of them being even. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4
\]
The combined probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3
\]
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.3 \times 100 = 30\%
\]

Therefore, it is \(\boxed{30}\) percent more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.",3,25

First, we know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Since her mother picked 20 apples, we calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
\[
\text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Next, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked to find the total number of apples picked by both:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 20 + 10 = 30

Thus, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is \boxed{30}.",30,30
mgsm-en-186,"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \) and the number of cages of hamsters as \( h \). According to the problem, there are 10 cages of hamsters, so \( h = 10 \). Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is \( 5h = 5 \times 10 = 50 \) pieces.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is 160. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is \( \frac{160}{6} = \frac{80}{3} \). Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation of the distribution.

The problem states that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, so the number of rats in each cage is \( \frac{80}{3 \times 3} = \frac{80}{9} \). However, this is not a whole number, which suggests a need to recheck the interpretation of the problem. Given the problem's constraints and the need for a whole number solution, we should consider the distribution of the straw in a way that fits the problem's constraints.

Since the problem states that the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the small rodents is 160, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the number of rats is \( \frac{160}{6} = \frac{80}{3} \). This is not a whole number, which suggests a need to re-evaluate the problem's constraints.

mgsm-en-188,"To determine how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing the bags and the total revenue from selling them, then use the profit to find the number of bags sold.

First, let's denote the number of bags sold as \( n \).

The cost of purchasing the bags is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost of purchasing and transporting the bags is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

We know that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of bags sold is:

\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66 \]

Now, we find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 + \$66 = \$102.00 \]

Since the total cost is to be split evenly among the three friends, we divide the total cost by 3:

First, let's find the net change in the number of trees each year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net change is:
\[10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}\]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years is:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:**
   On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.

2. **Flamingos taken back and painted:**
   On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white. One third of 18 is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left:**
   After taking back 6 pink flamingos, the number of pink flamingos left is:
   \[
   18 - 6 = 12

First, we need to find the cost of twenty dozen cups. Since one dozen is 12, twenty dozen is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups. The cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 240x \) dollars.

Next, we need to find the cost of half a dozen plates. Since one dozen is 12, half a dozen is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) plates. Each plate costs $6000, so the cost of half a dozen plates is \( 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \) dollars.

We need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn so that the total amount of money she earns is at least $70. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:

mgsm-en-211,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write the equation:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs collected as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the second equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \(\boxed{4}\) red chickens.",4,4
mgsm-en-212,"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Given that the park is 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
\]

Now that we know the perimeter, we can calculate the time Gary spends walking. We know that he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time spent walking is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Plugging in the values for the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour), we get:

mgsm-en-213,"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know that the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. The total number of customers over the three days can be expressed as:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

We can simplify this equation to solve for \( x \):
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250
mgsm-en-214,"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The big pool leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
2. The small pool leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
3. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
4. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, let's determine the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago. Since the pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
where \( B \) is the current amount of water in the big pool and \( S \) is the current amount of water in the small pool. Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B = 2S - 24 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 24 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S - 24 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 2S - 4S = 24 \]
\[ -2S = 24 \]
\[ S = -12 \]

This result seems incorrect because the amount of water cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem by substituting \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S = 2S - 24 \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 4S - 2S = -24 \]
\[ 2S = -24 \]
\[ S = -12 \]

This result is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem by substituting \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S = 2S - 24 \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 4S - 2S = -24 \]
\[ 2S = -24 \]
\[ S = -12 \]

The correct approach is to solve the system of equations correctly:
\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B = 2S - 24 \]
\[ 4S = 2S - 24 \]
\[ 2S = 24 \]
\[ S = 12 \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is \(\boxed{12}\).",12,8

\[
320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00
\]

So, the total cost of the shoes and belt is $352.00. Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

2. Determine the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount needed to find the remaining balance.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to return. The original amount is $2000, and she is supposed to return an additional 10% of this amount. The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]
So, the total amount she needs to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12 months. She is going to pay $165 per month, so the total amount paid over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount needed to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is \(\boxed{220}\).",220,220

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24

- Yuri scored \( Y \) points.
- Brianna scored \( B = 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.
- Jojo scored \( J \) points.

The total points scored by all four students is given as 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ N + Y + B + J = 251 \]
Substituting the known values of \( N \), \( B \), and \( Y \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 68 + Y + 85 + J = 251 \]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[ 153 + Y + J = 251 \]
Subtracting 153 from both sides, we get:
\[ Y + J = 98 \]
Since \( Y = \frac{1}{2}N + 10 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \), we can substitute \( Y = 44 \) into the equation \( Y + J = 98 \):

So, 12 penguins jump in and swim in the ocean.

Next, we calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner. Since another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that have left from the total number of penguins initially. The total number of penguins initially is 36. The number of penguins that have left is the sum of the penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean and the penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner:

\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]
Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
\]
Next, we subtract the total amount of water the two girls got from the initial amount of water:
\[
24 - 8 = 16 \text{ liters}
\]
Then, we subtract the amount of water the boy got from the remaining amount of water:
\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ liters}
\]
Therefore, the number of liters of water left is:
\[
\boxed{10}

polymath-low-en-84,"Let's denote the number of games won by the team as $W$ and the number of games lost as $L$. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of games played is 22, which gives us the equation:
\[W + L = 22\]

2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, which translates to:
\[W = L + 8\]

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can substitute the expression for $W$ from the second equation into the first equation:

\[L + 8 + L = 22\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[2L + 8 = 22\]

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

\[2L = 14\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

\[L = 7\]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting $L$ back into the second equation:

\[W = L + 8\]
\[W = 7 + 8\]
\[W = 15\]

Therefore, the number of games won by the team is $\boxed{15}$.",15,15

1. Calculate the number of vacations Gene has been on.
2. Determine the number of blocks from each year of vacations.
3. Calculate the total number of blocks.

First, we calculate the number of vacations Gene has been on. Since he has been on four vacations a year and he has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, we need to find out how many years he has been vacationing. He is now 34 years old, so he has been vacationing for:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years} \]

Since he has been on four vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is:
\[ 11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations} \]

Each row of blocks is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. Since he has been on four vacations a year for 11 years, the number of blocks from each year is:
\[ 44 \text{ vacations} \]

Since there are 11 years of vacations, the total number of blocks is:
\[ 44 \text{ vacations} \times 11 \text{ years} = 484 \text{ blocks} \]

Thus, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:

1. Identify the initial salary of Sylvie.
2. Calculate the salary increase for the first year.
3. Calculate the salary increase for the second year.
4. Calculate the salary increase for the third year.

The initial salary of Sylvie is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year. Let's calculate the salary after each year step by step.

**After the first year:**
The salary increase is \(600 \times 0.10 = 60\).
So, the salary after the first year is \(600 + 60 = 660\).

**After the second year:**
The salary increase is \(660 \times 0.10 = 66\).
So, the salary after the second year is \(660 + 66 = 726\).

**After the third year:**
The salary increase is \(726 \times 0.10 = 72.6\).
So, the salary after the third year is \(726 + 72.6 = 798.6\).

polymath-low-en-90,"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both adults and children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad needed for both adults and children to find the total amount required:

2. Use the information about Marcia's pets to find out how many pets Marcia has.
3. Use the information about Jan's pets to find out how many pets Jan has.
4. Sum the number of pets each person has to get the total.

First, we know that Cindy has 4 pets. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Cindy's pets} = 4 \]

Next, we know that Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pets Marcia has as follows:
\[ \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Then, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pets Jan has as follows:
\[ \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:
\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

- \( A \) for Amy,
- \( J \) for Jackson,
- \( C \) for Corey,
- \( I \) for James.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( A = J + 5 \)
2. \( A = C - 2 \)
3. \( I = C - 1 \)
4. \( I = 10 \)

From equation 4, we know that James is 10 years old. Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, we can find Corey's age by adding 1 to James's age:
\[ C = I + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can use equation 2 to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Finally, we can use equation 1 to find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The final answer is:

1. Determine Lee's original speed.
2. Calculate the speed improvement percentage for Gerald.
3. Calculate Gerald's new speed after the improvement.

First, let's find Lee's original speed. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Next, we calculate the speed improvement percentage for Gerald. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 110% of his original speed. Let's denote Gerald's original speed as \( v \). His new speed after the improvement is \( 1.1v \).

Since we know that Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds, we can express his original speed as:
\[ v = \frac{40 \text{ seconds}}{400 \text{ meters}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ seconds per meter} \]

Now, we calculate Gerald's new speed:
\[ 1.1v = 1.1 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1.1}{10} = 0.11 \text{ seconds per meter} \]

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in:

Now, we calculate the number of rabbits. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
\[ 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets:

   \[
   \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   Each can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is the original volume of tomatoes divided by the number of tomatoes per can.
   \[
   \text{Number of tomatoes} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{3 \text{ tomatoes per can}} = \frac{64}{3} \approx 21.33

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have driven through, and 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes. After the traffic jam, 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars left on the motorway is \( 30 - x - 20 + 5 = 25 - x \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of cars that took an exit, we assume that the exit of 5 cars does not affect the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is simply \( x \).

However, we need to ensure that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is consistent with the initial and final conditions. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \), and the number of cars left on the motorway is \( 25 - x \). Since the problem does not provide additional information about the exit of 5 cars, we can conclude that the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is simply the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, which is \( x \).

Given the problem's constraints and the information provided, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( x \). Since the problem does not provide additional information to determine the exact value of \( x \), we can only conclude that the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( x \).

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is equivalent to 90 minutes of TV.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is equivalent to 2 hours or 120 minutes of TV.

We know that the total time he watched TV over the week is 7 hours, which is equivalent to 420 minutes.

\text{Number of roll-ups Beatrice ate} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

Next, we calculate the number of roll-ups Marcell ate:
\[
\text{Number of roll-ups Marcell ate} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 3 \times 14 = 42
\]

Now, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice:
\[
\text{Total number of roll-ups} = 48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[
\text{Average number of roll-ups} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
polymath-low-en-111,"First, we need to find out how many liters of water the boat took on per second. Since the boat takes on two liters of water for every ten feet, we can calculate the rate of water accumulation per second by dividing the rate per ten feet by ten:

$$
\text{Rate per second} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times \frac{1 \text{ second}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{2}{10 \times 16} = \frac{2}{160} = \frac{1}{80} \text{ liters/second}
$$

Next, we need to find out how many seconds it took Julia to row 64 feet. Since it took her 64 seconds to row 64 feet, we can calculate the total time in seconds by multiplying the time per foot by the total distance:

$$
\text{Total time} = 64 \text{ feet} \times \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{1 \text{ foot}} = 64 \times 16 = 1024 \text{ seconds}
$$

Now, we can find out how much water the boat took on by multiplying the rate per second by the total time:

$$
\text{Total water} = \frac{1}{80} \text{ liters/second} \times 1024 \text{ seconds} = \frac{1024}{80} = 12.8 \text{ liters}
$$

Therefore, the boat had taken on $\boxed{12.8}$ liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.",8,16

1. Calculate the total number of lessons each teacher has in a day.
2. Determine the total number of lessons all teachers have in a day.
3. Calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.

First, we know that each teacher has 2 lessons per day. Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of lessons in a day is:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons} \]

Next, we know that each lesson requires the whiteboard to be cleaned 3 times. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings} \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned \(\boxed{24}\) times in a day.",24,24
polymath-low-en-113,"To determine how many flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days.
2. Subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted.

First, we calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers each day, we multiply the number of days by the number of flowers per day:
\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted. Since 5 flowers did not grow, we subtract 5 from 30:
\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

Therefore, the number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
polymath-low-en-114,"Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

According to the problem, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = 50D \]

We are also given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can write:
\[ 6 \times \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = 1800 \]

Substituting the expression for the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we get:
\[ 6 \times 50D = 1800 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 300D = 1800 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{1800}{300} \]
\[ D = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( \boxed{6} \).",6,6
polymath-low-en-115,"To calculate the profit Sasha makes from selling the lumber, we need to first determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and then subtract that from the total revenue she generates from selling the lumber.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**

   - **Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Each board costs $10.
     - Total cost for ten boards = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) dollars.

   - **Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Each board costs $16.
     - Total cost for five boards = \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) dollars.

   - **Total cost of all lumber:**
     - Total cost = \( 100 + 80 = 180 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:**

   - **Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Each board is sold for $10.
     - Total revenue from ten boards = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) dollars.

   - **Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
     - Each board is sold for $16.
     - Total revenue from five boards = \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) dollars.

   - **Total revenue from all lumber:**
     - Total revenue = \( 100 + 80 = 180 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**

   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = \( 180 - 180 = 0 \) dollars.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $\boxed{0}$.",0,90
polymath-low-en-116,"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. We are also given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons.

Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar used as \( S \) and the number of cups of water used as \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ S : W = 7 : 13 \]

This implies that the total amount of sugar and water used can be expressed as:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ W = \frac{13}{7} S \]

Now, substitute \( W \) in the total amount equation:
\[ S + \frac{13}{7} S = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{7}{7} S + \frac{13}{7} S = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20}{7} S = 120 \]

To solve for \( S \), multiply both sides by 7:
\[ 20 S = 840 \]

Then, divide both sides by 20:
\[ S = \frac{840}{20} \]
\[ S = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

polymath-low-en-118,"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we start by calculating the total number of vehicles imported on the first day. According to the problem, there were 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Since 10 vehicles were imported on the first day, the number of vehicles imported on the second day must be the difference between the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day and the number of vehicles imported on the first day. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
polymath-low-en-119,"To determine the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
2. Determine Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
4. Determine Lylah's salary four years later.
5. Find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later.

**Step 1: Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as:
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{\text{Adrien's salary}}{1.30} = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Determine Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary increased by 40 percent. Therefore, his salary four years later is:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years ago is the same as Adrien's salary four years ago, which is $40000.

**Step 4: Determine Lylah's salary four years later.**

Lylah's salary increased by 40 percent. Therefore, her salary four years later is:
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

**Step 5: Find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later.**

The total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is:
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 56000 = 112000 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{112000}\).",112000,95200
polymath-low-en-120,"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
2. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week. Since each pad contains 30 sheets of paper, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly usage by 4:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Therefore, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is \(\boxed{240}\).",240,240

First, let's calculate the number of fruits Morisette brought:
- Morisette brought 5 apples.
- Morisette brought 8 oranges.
So, the total number of fruits Morisette brought is:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples} \]
- Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges} \]
So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \]

polymath-low-en-123,"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first segment where she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second segment where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much time is left for her to run at 5 miles per hour. Since she runs for a total of 7 hours, the time she runs at 5 miles per hour is:
\[
\text{Time}_2 = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
\]

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs in the remaining 4 hours:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, we add the distances from both segments to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}

After putting stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters that are now already stamped is \( \frac{x}{3} \). The problem states that after this action, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
