mgsm-en-188,"To determine how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bags, the total transportation cost, and the total revenue from selling the bags, and then use the profit to find the number of bags sold.

Let's denote the number of bags sold by \( n \).

1. **Total cost of buying the bags:**
   The cost of buying \( n \) bags at $20 per bag is \( 20n \).

2. **Total transportation cost:**
   The transportation cost for \( n \) bags is \( 2n \).

3. **Total revenue from selling the bags:**
   The revenue from selling \( n \) bags at $30 per bag is \( 30n \).

4. **Total profit:**
   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost of buying and transporting the bags. The profit is given as $400. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:
   \[
   30n - (20n + 2n) = 400
   \]
   Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
   \[
   30n - 22n = 400
   \]
   \[
   8n = 400
   \]
   Solving for \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   n = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Thus, the number of bags the trader sold is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50
mgsm-en-189,"Let's denote the cost of each ticket as \( T \). According to the problem, the total cost of the tickets is $20.25, so we have:

\[ 3T = 20.25 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{20.25}{3} = 6.75 \]

The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of food is:

\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

The total cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost of the rides is:

\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

The total cost of all the expenses is the sum of the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the total cost of the rides:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the total cost is to be split evenly among the three friends, each friend pays:

\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid $34.",34,34

mgsm-en-191,"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly amount to a daily amount.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the weekly amount to a daily amount. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs $5$ pounds of insects per day. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]",5,5
mgsm-en-192,"Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 trees a year, so he adds 10 trees to the total each year. He also chops down 2 trees a year, so he subtracts 2 trees from the total each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

After 10 years, the total number of trees he has is 50 + (8 trees/year * 10 years) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

If 30% of the trees die, then 70% of the trees remain. So, the number of trees that remain is 70% of 130 trees, which is 0.70 * 130 = 91 trees.

Therefore, the answer is 91.",91,91
mgsm-en-193,"To determine how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

1. **Friday morning**: The neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.
   - Number of pink flamingos: \(18\)

2. **Saturday morning**: The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.
   - Total number of flamingos: \(12 + 6 = 18\)

3. **Sunday morning**: The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots distributed to all the restaurants.
2. Subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find the remaining amount.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots distributed to all the restaurants. Since each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find the remaining amount of carrots. The initial amount of carrots is 200 pounds, so the remaining amount is:

mgsm-en-199,"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many sentences Mark edits from each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week and he edits an equal number from each publisher, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences from each publisher} \]

Next, we calculate Mark's earnings from Publisher A. Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher A are:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate Mark's earnings from Publisher B. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence (because 5 cents is half of 10 cents). Therefore, his earnings from Publisher B are:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum up the earnings from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

So, John's new salary after the raise is:

$$
\text{New Salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John made from his salary for the year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply his new salary by 52:

$$
\text{Total Salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200

We know that the big pool leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, and the small pool leaks at the same rate. Therefore, the amount of water that has leaked out of both pools in the 4 minutes is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. This means that the current amount of water in the big pool is \( B = S - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was \( B - 4 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was \( S - 4 \) gallons. This gives us the equation:

\[ B - 4 = 2(S - 4) \]

Substituting \( B = S - 16 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ (S - 16) - 4 = 2(S - 4) \]
\[ S - 20 = 2S - 8 \]
\[ -20 + 8 = 2S - S \]
\[ -12 = S \]

So, the small pool has \( S = -12 \) gallons of water now. However, since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the small pool had more water 4 minutes ago, so the equation should be:

\[ B - 4 = 2(S - 4) \]
\[ B = 2S - 8 \]

Substituting \( B = S - 16 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ S - 16 = 2S - 8 \]
\[ -16 + 8 = 2S - S \]
\[ -8 = S \]

So, the small pool has \( S = -8 \) gallons of water now. The correct interpretation should be that the small pool had more water 4 minutes ago, so the equation should be:

We know the total points scored by all four students is 251, and Naomi scored 68 points. Let's denote the points scored by Yuri, Brianna, and Jojo as \( Y \), \( B \), and \( J \) respectively.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Therefore, we have:
\[ Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, we have:
\[ B = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can find the points scored by Jojo by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students:
\[ J = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Thus, the number of points Jojo scored is:

4. Sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to get the total number of pets.

Step 1: Identify the number of dogs.
The number of dogs is given as 60.

Step 2: Use the ratio of cats to dogs to find the number of cats.
The ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1. Therefore, the number of cats is:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of rabbits.
The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have driven through, and 5 cars have taken an exit. Therefore, the number of cars remaining on the motorway after 15 minutes is:
\[ 30 - x - 5 = 25 - x \]

In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam. So, the total number of cars that have driven through the traffic jam by the end of the 30 minutes is:

Since the total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is 30, the number of cars that have driven through the traffic jam must be equal to the number of cars that were originally on the motorway minus the number of cars that remain on the motorway after the traffic jam. This gives us the equation:

1. **Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Frankie watched 1-hour episodes on Monday and Tuesday.
   - Total hours watched on Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show.
   - Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\).
   - Total hours watched on Wednesday: \(x \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 0.5x \text{ hours}\).

3. **Thursday:**
   - Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show on Thursday.
   - Total hours watched on Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Friday:**
   - Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes on Friday.
   - Total hours watched on Friday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is calculated by multiplying the width by the length: \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- His roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups Marcell ate is calculated by multiplying the width by the length: \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

1. Calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water.
2. Determine the total distance rowed.
3. Calculate the total amount of water taken on.

**Step 1: Calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water.**

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows. So, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total distance rowed.**

Julia rowed for 64 seconds at a rate of 20 feet per second. Therefore, the total distance rowed is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times 20 \text{ feet/second} = 1280 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water taken on.**

The boat takes on 0.2 liters of water for every foot it rows. So, the total amount of water taken on is:
\[ \text{Water} = 1280 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 256 \text{ liters} \]

According to the problem, the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold is 6 times more than Brittany's phone. If Brittany's phone can hold \( B \) photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold \( 6B \) photographs. We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we can write:

\[ 6B = 1800 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} \]
\[ B = 300 \]

Now, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. So, if \( B \) is the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, then the number of birds in Jamal's photograph \( D \) can be found by dividing \( B \) by 50:

1. Calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.
2. Calculate the total selling price of the lumber.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total selling price to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total cost of the lumber:**
   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
     \]
   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:

     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total cost:
     \[
     \$100 + \$80 = \$180
     \]

2. **Total selling price of the lumber:**
   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:

     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total selling price:
     \[
     \$100 + \$80 = \$180
     \]

3. **Profit calculation:**
   - Subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

mgsm-en-116,"Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \( S \) and the number of cups of water as \( W \). According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. We can express this relationship as:

\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

We also know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write:

\[ S + W = 120 \]

We can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \) using the ratio:

\[ W = \frac{13}{7} S \]

Now, substitute \( W \) in the total amount equation:

\[ S + \frac{13}{7} S = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ \frac{7}{7} S + \frac{13}{7} S = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20}{7} S = 120 \]

To solve for \( S \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{7}{20} \):

\[ S = 120 \times \frac{7}{20} \]
\[ S = 6 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \( 42 \). The final answer is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is \( 5x \). The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is the sum of the vehicles from the first day and the vehicles from the second day. This can be expressed as:

Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40 percent, and he was earning $40000. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A + 0.4A = 40000 \]
\[ 1.4A = 40000 \]
\[ A = \frac{40000}{1.4} = 28571.42857142857 \]

Since \( A = 1.3L \), we can find \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{A}{1.3} = \frac{28571.42857142857}{1.3} = 21978.260869565217 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later. Adrien's salary four years later is $40000, and Lylah's salary four years later is \( L + 0.4L = 1.4L \):

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 40000 + 1.4L \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 40000 + 1.4 \times 21978.260869565217 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 40000 + 30778.009137315708 \]
\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 70778.009137315708 \]

This means that the number of letters needing stamps is \( 60 - x \), and she stamps one-third of these letters, which is \( \frac{1}{3}(60 - x) \).

After stamping, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is \( x + \frac{1}{3}(60 - x) \). We know this number is 30, so we can set up the equation:

mgsm-en-134,"To calculate how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we first need to determine the total cost for one car wash, which is $15. Then, we multiply that by the number of car washes he gets per month, which is 4. Finally, we multiply that by the number of months in a year, which is 12.

Let's do the math:

1. Cost per car wash: $15
2. Number of car washes per month: 4
3. Number of months in a year: 12

Total cost per year = Cost per car wash × Number of car washes per month × Number of months in a year

Total cost per year = $15 × 4 × 12

Total cost per year = $60 × 12

Total cost per year = $720

Next, we calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in 6 hours for the second test:
$$
\text{Questions completed in the second test} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions}

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Let's denote the number of blue ties as \( n \). Therefore, the number of red ties is \( 2n \).

The cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie. So, the cost of one red tie is \( B + 0.5B = 1.5B \).

The total cost of the blue ties is given by:
\[ \text{Total cost of blue ties} = n \times B = n \times 40 \]

The total cost of the red ties is:
\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 2n \times 1.5B = 2n \times 1.5 \times 40 = 2n \times 60 = 120n \]

The total amount spent by John is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = n \times 40 + 120n = 160n \]

We know that John spent a total of $200 on ties. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 160n = 200 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{200}{160} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \]

Now, we can find the total amount spent on ties:

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per day.
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Determine the number of eggs produced per week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

First, let's calculate the time taken to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM. The distance from 1 PM to 4 PM is 3 hours (since 4 PM is 3 hours after 1 PM). The speed of the ship is 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to travel this distance is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{10 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.3 \text{ hours}
\]
Converting 0.3 hours into minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[
0.3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 18 \text{ minutes}
\]
So, it takes Tom 18 minutes to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM.

Next, let's calculate the time taken to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM. The distance from 4 PM to 1 PM is also 3 hours. The speed of the ship is 6 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to travel this distance is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]
Converting 0.5 hours into minutes:
\[
0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}

The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds, so the weight of the driver is \( 3755 - 15n \) pounds. The total weight of the truck, including the boxes and the driver, is \( 15n + (3755 - 15n) = 3755 \) pounds. This means the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds is exceeded by \( 3755 - 15n \) pounds.

We need to find the maximum number of boxes \( n \) such that the total weight does not exceed 5000 pounds. This gives us the inequality:
\[ 15n + (3755 - 15n) \leq 5000 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3755 \leq 5000 \]
This inequality is always true, so we need to find the maximum \( n \) such that the weight of the boxes plus the driver does not exceed 5000 pounds. The weight of the driver is \( 3755 - 15n \), so we need:
\[ 15n + (3755 - 15n) \leq 5000 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 3755 \leq 5000 \]
So, we need to find the maximum \( n \) such that:
\[ 15n \leq 5000 \]
Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[ n \leq \frac{5000}{15} \approx 333.33 \]

We are given that there are 5 students for every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers can be found by dividing the total number of students by 5:
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount of money she receives from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total includes her initial amount plus the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to solve for \( x \):

mgsm-en-70,"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her total earnings from both the dance classes she teaches on weekdays and the dance classes she teaches on Saturday.

First, let's calculate the number of dance classes Judy teaches on weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day on weekdays.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.

So, the total number of dance classes on weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of dance classes Judy teaches on Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday.

So, the total number of dance classes on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of dance classes Judy teaches in one week:
\[ 25 \text{ classes (weekdays)} + 8 \text{ classes (Saturday)} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Each dance class has 15 students, so the total number of students Judy teaches in one week is:
\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so her total earnings for the week are:
\[ 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:

\]
\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129

mgsm-en-75,"To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level as \( A_4 \), the second level as \( A_3 \), the third level as \( A_2 \), and the fourth level as \( A_1 \). We know that:

\[ A_4 = 16 \]

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of each level as follows:

\[ A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ A_2 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ A_1 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the average square footage of a level by summing the square footage of all four levels and dividing by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{A_4 + A_3 + A_2 + A_1}{4} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average square footage} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is $7.5$.",5,60
mgsm-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Jason spends on calls with his boss this month.
2. Add the extra minutes he has for other people.
3. Subtract the total minutes spent on calls from his monthly plan.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason spends on calls with his boss. Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on calls with his boss is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he has for other people. He has 300 extra minutes for other people. So, the total minutes spent on calls this month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we subtract the total minutes spent on calls from his monthly plan. Jason's phone plan allows 1000 minutes per month, so the number of minutes he has left is:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Ginger gives Griffin a handful of fries, so Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries, where \(x\) is the number of fries Ginger gave.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries, so we can set up the equation \(7 + x = 27\).

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[ S_w = 4 \times S_m \]

Since \( S_m = 5 \) (the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ S_w = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so let's denote the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Tuesday as \( S_t \). Therefore, the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday is \( 2 \times S_t \). Since \( S_t = 13 \) (the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Tuesday), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ S_w = 2 \times 13 = 26 \]

So, Sue ate 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:

- Sue's total cookies: \( S_w + 26 = 20 + 26 = 46 \)
- Sue's sister's total cookies: \( S_m + S_t = 5 + 13 = 18 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of calories each of them consumed. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:

- Sue's total calories: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \)
- Sue's sister's total calories: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \)

Finally, we find the difference in calories between Sue and her sister:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house after repairs.
2. Determine the increase in the house's value.
3. Calculate the new value of the house.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value.

Let's start with the total cost of the house after repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Cost of repairs} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

Next, we calculate the increase in the house's value. The problem states that the value increased by 150%. This means the increase in value is:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times \text{Initial cost} = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000 \]

Now, we find the new value of the house by adding the increase in value to the initial cost:
\[ \text{New value} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Increase in value} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000 \]

3. Determine how much feed is needed for the final meal.

First, let's find the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal. Since Wendi has 3 separate meals and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed available is:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ cups} \]
because each chicken gets 15 cups of feed per day.

Now, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed available:

First, let's calculate the cost of the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the second glass, which is 60% of the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the third glass, which is 60% of the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the third glass} = 0.60 \times 3 = \$1.80 \]

We continue this process for each subsequent glass. The cost of the \( n \)-th glass can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost of the } n\text{-th glass} = 5 \times (0.60)^{n-1} \]

To find the total cost for 16 glasses, we sum the costs of each individual glass:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 3 + 1.80 + 1.08 + 0.648 + 0.3888 + 0.23264 + 0.149616 + 0.0958392 + 0.057903856 + 0.034742312 + 0.0208453872 + 0.01250722592 + 0.007504336752 + 0.004502601876 + 0.0027016811384 \]

3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
5. After selling at the orange house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is equal to 5.

Let's set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5

First, simplify the term inside the parentheses:

\[

polymath-low-en-18,"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.**
Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. So, she eats 3 eggs each day.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.**
There are 7 days in a week. So, the number of eggs she eats in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.**
Since she eats 21 eggs each week, in 4 weeks she will eat:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.**
There are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

polymath-low-en-19,"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to achieve the desired average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
   \]
   Given that the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles:
   \[
   4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}}
   \]
   Solving for the total time:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining distance to be covered:**
   Marissa has already walked 4 miles and 2 miles, so the remaining distance is:
   \[
   12 - 4 - 2 = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the required time to cover the remaining distance:**
   The total time available is 3 hours, and she has already used 1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles. Therefore, the remaining time is:
   \[
   3 - 1 - 1 = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   To find the speed needed to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of $6$ miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.",12,6

First, calculate the time taken to download the first 80% of the file:
- Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute.
- 80% of 200 GB is \(0.8 \times 200 = 160\) GB.
- The time to download 160 GB at 2 GB per minute is \(160 \div 2 = 80\) minutes.

Next, calculate the time taken to download the remaining 20% of the file after the restart:
- After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 20% of the file.
- The time to download 20% of 200 GB is \(0.2 \times 200 = 40\) GB.
- The time to download 40 GB at 2 GB per minute is \(40 \div 2 = 20\) minutes.

The total time to download the file is the sum of the time taken to download the first 80% and the time taken to download the remaining 20%:
\[80 + 20 = 100\] minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes Carla to download the file is \(\boxed{100}\) minutes.",100,160

mgsm-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it will take for the total profit to cover the initial planting cost.

First, let's calculate the net profit per year. The tree grows 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

The revenue from selling the lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

The cost to water and feed the tree is:
\[ \$3/\text{year} \]

The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year} \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost of $90. We do this by dividing the initial planting cost by the net profit per year:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

3. Determine the amount of water lost due to the spill.
4. Sum the amounts of water from the orange drink, pineapple drink, and the remaining water after the spill.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink.**

The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in 10 liters is:
\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in 15 liters is:
\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}

mgsm-en-38,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide that by the total number of hours he runs.

First, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's determine the total number of hours John runs in a week. He runs 3 days a week, and he runs for 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours} + \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours} = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the speed by dividing the total distance by the total number of hours:

We are given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, so we have:

\[ 2W = 3 \]
\[ W = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance Dana can travel in one hour. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, the time spent running is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 6 hours, which is 2 hours, and the time spent walking is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6 hours, which is 4 hours. The distance she can travel is the sum of the distance she runs and the distance she walks:

polymath-low-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through, and then 5 cars exit the line. The number of cars remaining on the motorway after these events is:

\[ 30 - x + 20 - 5 = 45 - x \]

We know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is:

\[ x + 20 \]

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the number of cars that remained on the motorway after the events, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 20 = 45 - x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x + x = 45 - 20 \]

- On Wednesday, he watched \( x \) episodes of 30 minutes each, which totals \( x \) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which totals \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Given that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can set up a proportion to find out how many cups of water she used. Let's denote the number of cups of water used as \( x \).

The ratio can be written as:
\[
\frac{7}{13} = \frac{120}{x}
\]

To find \( x \), we cross-multiply:
\[
7x = 13 \times 120
\]

Calculate the right-hand side:
\[
13 \times 120 = 1560
\]

So, we have:
\[
7x = 1560
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[
x = \frac{1560}{7}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
x = 222.857142857
\]

Since the number of cups of water must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number:
\[
x \approx 223

Thus, Katy used approximately 223 cups of water.

Next, we need to find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar she used. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used can be calculated as:

\[ 1.4A = 40000 \]
\[ A = \frac{40000}{1.4} = 28571.43 \]

Since \( A = 1.3L \), we can substitute \( A \) with 28571.43:

3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he eats:

Next, let's calculate how much money John spent on the video games. He bought 8 video games at $20 each, so he spent:

$20 \times 8 = $160

Now, let's find out how much money John had left after buying the video games. He had $5 left after buying the video games, so we can subtract the amount he spent on the video games from the money he made from selling the lego sets:

$195 - $160 = $35

This means John had $35 left after buying the video games. Since he originally had $195 from selling the lego sets, we can add this to the $35 he had left to find out how much money he had in total:

$195 + $35 = $230

Now, we know that John has $5 left after buying the video games, so we can subtract this from the total amount of money he had to find out how much money he spent on the video games:

$230 - $5 = $225

Since each video game costs $20, we can divide the total amount spent on video games by the cost of one video game to find out how many video games he bought:

$225 ÷ $20 = 11.25

Since John can't buy a fraction of a video game, he bought 11 video games. Now, we know that John originally had 13 lego sets, and he bought 8 video games, so he has:

polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her activities into running, walking, and skipping, and then calculate the distance for each activity.

First, we know that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. Since skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that running is four times faster than walking. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \div 4 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, the time spent running is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
The time spent walking is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana travels during each activity:
- The distance traveled while running is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
- The distance traveled while walking is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana travels in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]",18,18

polymath-low-en-43,"First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag and each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate the total calories as follows:

\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Number of servings} \times \text{Calories per serving} = 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many grams of chips can be eaten if your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Subtract the calories you have already consumed from your daily calorie target:

\[

1. Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks. Since Charlie can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax and he makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Since each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$40.00 - \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

polymath-low-en-45,"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles more than on Monday.
- Therefore, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:

Total articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can calculate the total number of hours spent writing:

Total hours = Total articles * Average hours per article
Total hours = 26 * 4 = 104 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is $104$.",104,104

polymath-low-en-47,"Let's denote the cost of a blue tie as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = \$40 \).

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Let's denote the number of blue ties as \( n \). Therefore, the number of red ties is \( 2n \).

The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. So, the cost of a red tie is \( B + 0.5B = 1.5B \).

The total cost of the blue ties is \( n \times B = n \times 40 \).

The total cost of the red ties is \( 2n \times 1.5B = 2n \times 1.5 \times 40 = 12n \times 40 = 480n \).

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost} = n \times 40 + 480n = 40n + 480n = 520n \]

We know that John spent $200 on blue ties, so:

\[ n \times 40 = 200 \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Now we can calculate the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 520n = 520 \times 5 = 2600 \]

So, John spent $2600 on ties. The final answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per day.
2. Convert the daily egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the daily revenue from selling the eggs.
4. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the daily egg production into dozens:

\[
\text{Number of dozens per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens}

Next, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, the daily revenue from selling the eggs is:

\[
\text{Daily revenue} = 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the weekly revenue, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[

polymath-low-en-75,"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level as \( A_4 \), the second level as \( A_3 \), the third level as \( A_2 \), and the bottom level as \( A_1 \). According to the problem, \( A_4 = 16 \).

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of the other levels as follows:
\[ A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ A_2 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ A_1 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we need to find the average square footage of the levels. The average is calculated by summing the square footage of all levels and then dividing by the number of levels. The total square footage of the sandcastle is:
\[ A_4 + A_3 + A_2 + A_1 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( b = 2q \).

We also know the total number of bees is 700:
\[ w + b + q = 700. \]

Substituting \( w = 2b \) and \( b = 2q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2b + b + q = 700. \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 3b + q = 700. \]

Since \( b = 2q \), substitute \( b \) with \( 2q \):
\[ 3(2q) + q = 700. \]
\[ 6q + q = 700. \]
\[ 7q = 700. \]

Solving for \( q \):
\[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now, we can find \( b \) and \( w \):
\[ b = 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200. \]

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, and each back and forth is the length of the football field, which is 100 yards. Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[
15 \times 100 = 1500 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for one round trip is:
\[
100 \text{ yards} + 100 \text{ yards} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]
So, the distance for the initial back and forth is 200 yards, and the distance for the 34 round trips is:
\[
34 \times 200 = 6800 \text{ yards}
\]
Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[
200 + 6800 = 7000 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distances run by Blake and Kelly:
\[
7000 - 1500 = 5500 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner runs $\boxed{5500}$ yards farther than the loser.",5500,80

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months.
   - After the first two months, the price increases by 20% of $20.
   - After the second two months, the price increases by 20% of the new price.
   - This process continues for a total of 18 two-month periods (since 36 months is 18 two-month periods).

3. **Formula for the Price After Each Two-Month Period**:
   - Let \( P_n \) be the price after \( n \) two-month periods.
   - The price after the first two months is \( P_1 = 20 \times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \times 1.20 = 24 \).
   - The price after the second two months is \( P_2 = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.80 \).
   - The price after the third two months is \( P_3 = 28.80 \times 1.20 = 34.56 \).
   - This pattern continues, so the price after \( n \) two-month periods is \( P_n = 20 \times (1.20)^n \).

4. **Price After 18 Two-Month Periods**:
   - After 18 two-month periods, the price is \( P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \).

5. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   - Using a calculator, \( (1.20)^{18} \approx 8.0737 \).

6. **Final Price**:
   - Therefore, the price after 18 two-month periods is \( P_{18} = 20 \times 8.0737 \approx 161.474 \).

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $161.47.

1. Identify the cost of each type of toy.
2. Calculate the total value of each type of toy.
3. Sum the values of all the toys.

First, we know the cost of the doll is equal to the cost of 3 action figures and one red car. The cost of one red car is $4, so the cost of 3 action figures is $15 (since the cost of one action figure is $5). Therefore, the cost of the doll is:
\[ 3 \times 5 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total value of the action figures. There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5, so the total value of the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total value of the red cars. There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4, so the total value of the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). After rolling an even number, there are now 5 numbers left on the die, with 2 of them being even. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1 \times 2}{2 \times 5} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[

First, let's calculate the monthly interest rate:
\[ \text{Monthly interest rate} = 2\% = 0.02 \]

Next, we need to find the total interest Mandy will owe over 3 months. The formula for the total interest is:
\[ \text{Total interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly interest rate} \times \text{Number of months} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Total interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total interest} = 100 \times 0.06 \]
\[ \text{Total interest} = 6 \]

So, the total interest Mandy owes over 3 months is $6. Therefore, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is:
\[ \text{Amount to give} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total interest} \]
\[ \text{Amount to give} = 100 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Amount to give} = 106 \]

Thus, Mandy should give Benedict $106. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{106} \]",106,106
