On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate how many hours in total she spent writing articles over these three days.\n\nTo solve this, we first determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day:\n\n- **Monday**: 5 articles\n- **Tuesday**: \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 5 = 2 \\) articles\n- **Wednesday**: \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) articles\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:\n\\[ 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 \\]\n\nSince each article takes 4 hours to write, the total time spent writing articles is:\n\\[ 11 \\times 4 = 44 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time Meredith spent writing articles over these three days is $\\\\boxed{44}$ hours.", "pred_number": 44, "answer": 104, "is_correct": 0}

On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. If one cookie contains 200 calories, how many more calories did Su get compared to her sister?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each person ate and then convert those into calories.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many cookies Su ate:\n- On Monday, Su ate the same number of cookies as her sister, which is 5 cookies.\n- On Tuesday, Su ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is \\(2 \\times 13 = 26\\) cookies.\nSo, the total number of cookies Su ate is \\(5 + 26 = 31\\).\n\nNext, let's find out how many cookies Su's sister ate:\n- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.\n- On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.\nSo, the total number of cookies her sister ate is \\(5 + 13 = 18\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total calories each person consumed:\n- Su ate 31 cookies, and each cookie contains 200 calories, so Su consumed \\(31 \\times 200 = 6200\\) calories.\n- Her sister ate 18 cookies, and each cookie contains 200 calories, so her sister consumed \\(18 \\times 200 = 3600\\) calories.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many more calories Su got compared to her sister:\n\\[6200 - 3600 = 2600\\]\n\nSo, Su got \\(\\boxed{2600}\\) more calories compared to her sister.", "pred_number": 2600, "answer": 5600, "is_correct": 0}

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. How much would 8 pens cost?\n\nTo find the cost of a pen, we first add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:\n\\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \\]\n\nSo, a pen costs $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the price of one pen by 8:\n\\[ 1.50 \\times 8 = 12.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of 8 pens is \\(\\boxed{12.00}\\).", "pred_number": 0, "answer": 12, "is_correct": 0}
