According to the problem, John has $5 left, but our calculation shows he has $35 left. This discrepancy suggests that John did not use all his Lego game money to buy video games, but rather he had some leftover. However, the problem states he has $5 left, so we need to consider that he might have sold fewer Lego games or the problem might have a different context, but based on the given information, we can assume he sold all 13 Lego games and the remaining $5 is the leftover.\n\n5. Determine how many Lego games John has left:\nSince John sold all 13 Lego games, he has:\n\\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the number of Lego games John has left is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).", "pred_number": 0, "answer": 2, "is_correct": 0}

A 20% delivery service charge is added to the bill, and Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. How much will his order cost with delivery included?\n\nTo calculate the total cost, we first find the cost of the items before the delivery charge and tip:\n\n- Sandwiches: $7.50 × 2 = $15.00\n- Bags of chips: $1.50 × 2 = $3.00\n- Cookies: $1.00 × 2 = $2.00\n\nAdding these together gives the subtotal:\n$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00\n\nNext, we calculate the 20% delivery charge:\n20% of $20.00 = 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00\n\nAdding the delivery charge to the subtotal:\n$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00\n\nFinally, we add the $5.00 tip:\n$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Rory's order with delivery included is $\\boxed{29.00}$.", "pred_number": 0, "answer": 29, "is_correct": 0}

The formula for the average is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total score of the five exams}}{5}\n\\]\n\nWe want the average to be 93, so:\n\n\\[\n93 = \\frac{\\text{Total score of the five exams}}{5}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 gives:\n\n\\[\n465 = \\text{Total score of the five exams}\n\\]\n\nThis means the sum of the scores of the five highest exams (excluding the lowest score of 71) must be 465. Let's denote the score on the sixth exam as \\( x \\). The sum of the scores of the five highest exams will be:\n\n\\[\n89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x = 465\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n\\[\n367 + x = 465\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 465 - 367\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 98\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Brinley needs to score \\(\\boxed{98}\\) on her sixth exam to achieve an average of 93.", "pred_number": 93, "answer": 98, "is_correct": 0}

How many Pokémon cards does she have in total now?\n\nAnswer: Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.\n2. After a month, she had three times more than she originally had. So, the number of cards she had after a month is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 3 = 60\n   \\]\n3.

In the third month, she had twice the total number of cards she had in the first and second months.

Se dio cuenta de que puede ahorrar dinero si mezcla la tinta de cinco bolígrafos vacíos para llenar un bolígrafo completo. Si compra 25 bolígrafos y luego los usa para hacer bolígrafos nuevos cuando se están quedando sin tinta, ¿cuántos bolígrafos termina teniendo en total?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "full_response": "Translation: Ram uses many pens. He realized he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to fill one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when they are running out of ink, how many pens does he end up with in total?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to fill one full pen. Initially, Ram has 25 pens. After using these pens, he will have 25 empty pens. He can then mix the ink from these 25 empty pens to fill 5 new pens (since 25 empty pens can be grouped into 5 groups of 5 pens each).\n\nAfter filling these 5 new pens, Ram will have 5 new pens and 20 empty pens left (since 25 - 5 = 20). He can then mix the ink from these 20 empty pens to fill 4 more pens (since 20 empty pens can be grouped into 4 groups of 5 pens each).\n\nAfter filling these 4 new pens, Ram will have 4 new pens and 16 empty pens left (since 20 - 4 = 16). He can then mix the ink from these 16 empty pens to fill 3 more pens (since 16 empty pens can be grouped into 3 groups of 5 pens each, with 1 pen left over).\n\nAfter filling these 3 new pens, Ram will have 3 new pens and 11 empty pens left (since 16 - 3 = 13, but we only need 10 more to make 3 more pens, so we have 11 empty pens left). He can then mix the ink from these 11 empty pens to fill 2 more pens (since 11 empty pens can be grouped into 2 groups of 5 pens each, with 1 pen left over).\n\nAfter filling these 2 new pens, Ram will have 2 new pens and 6 empty pens left (since 11 - 2 = 9, but we only need 10 more to make 2 more pens, so we have 6 empty pens left). He can then mix the ink from these 6 empty pens to fill 1 more pen (since 6 empty pens can be grouped into 1 group of 5 pens, with 1 pen left over).\n\nAfter filling this 1 new pen, Ram will have 1 new pen and 1 empty pen left (since 6 - 1 = 5, but we only need 5 more to make 1 more pen, so we have 1 empty pen left). He cannot make any more pens with this 1 empty pen.\n\nSo, the total number of pens Ram ends up with is the original 25 pens plus the 15 new pens he made (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1). Therefore, the total number of pens is:\n\n\\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{40}\\).", "pred_number": 40, "answer": 31, "is_correct": 0}
