Then we will use these probabilities to find the probability of the desired outcome.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probability of getting a number greater than 3.

Determine the required score on the sixth test.\n\nFirst, let's identify the lowest score from the first five tests:\nThe scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.\n\nNext, we need to find the total score required for the six tests to have an average of 93. The formula for the average is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total score}}{\\text{Number of tests}}\n\\]\nWe want the average to be 93, and there are 6 tests, so:\n\\[\n93 = \\frac{\\text{Total score}}{6} \\implies \\text{Total score} = 93 \\times 6 = 558\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out what the total score of the first five tests is, and then determine what the sixth test score should be to reach a total of 558. The total score of the first five tests is:\n\\[\n89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\n\\]\nIf we remove the lowest score (71), the new total of the remaining four scores is:\n\\[\n89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\n\\]\nTo find the required score on the sixth test, we subtract the total of the four highest scores from the required total score:\n\\[\n558 - 367 = 191\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Brinley must score \\(\\boxed{191}\\) on her sixth test to have an average of 93.", "pred_number": 93, "answer": 98, "is_correct": 0}
