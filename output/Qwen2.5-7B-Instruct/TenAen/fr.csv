mgsm-fr-47,"Translation: Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on the blue ties which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total?

To solve this, we first determine the number of blue ties Jean bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on them, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount Jean spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800
mgsm-fr-48,"Translation: To support the tomato plants in her garden, Tracy used a wire that was 4 feet long. This wire was cut into several pieces that are 6 inches long. How many pieces did she get?

To answer the question, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide by the length of each piece.

1. Convert 4 feet to inches: \(4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}\).
2. Divide the total length by the length of each piece: \(48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces}\).

mgsm-fr-49,"Translation: Richard lives in one of the apartments of a 15-story building. Each floor contains 8 apartments. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, what is the total number of unoccupied apartments in the building?

To find the total number of unoccupied apartments, we first need to determine the total number of apartments in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments is:

\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these apartments are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied apartments is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

The number of unoccupied apartments is the total number of apartments minus the number of occupied apartments:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied apartments in the building is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30

mgsm-fr-51,"Translation: Tom's boat moves at 10 miles per hour. He sails from 13:00 to 16:00, then sets off on the return journey at a speed of 6 miles per hour. How long will it take him to get back?

To determine how long it will take Tom to return, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Tom travels during his outbound journey.
2. Determine the time required for the return journey based on the distance and the return speed.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance of the outbound journey.**

Tom sails from 13:00 to 16:00, which is a total of 3 hours. His speed is 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he travels is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the time required for the return journey.**

The return journey is also 30 miles, but the speed is 6 miles per hour. The time required for the return journey is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, the time it will take Tom to get back is \(\boxed{5}\) hours.",5,5
mgsm-fr-52,"Translation: Uriah's bag becomes too heavy for him. He must reduce its weight by 15 pounds. Each of his comic books weighs 1/4 pound and each of his toys weighs 1/2 pound. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys will he need to remove?

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total weight reduction from removing 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so the weight reduction from 30 comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be reduced to reach the total of 15 pounds. This is calculated as:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to reduce the weight by 7.5 pounds is:
\[ \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of toys that Uriah needs to remove is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15
mgsm-fr-53,"Translation: A mechanic practices different repair rates for truck and car tires. For each truck tire repaired, he charges $60, and he charges $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, he repaired 12 car tires and none of truck tires. On which day were the earnings the highest, and how much more money did the mechanic earn on that day?

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The earnings from truck tires are calculated as:
\[ 6 \text{ tires} \times 60 \text{ dollars/tire} = 360 \text{ dollars} \]
The earnings from car tires are calculated as:
\[ 4 \text{ tires} \times 40 \text{ dollars/tire} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total earnings on Thursday are:
\[ 360 \text{ dollars} + 160 \text{ dollars} = 520 \text{ dollars} \]

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The earnings from car tires are calculated as:
\[ 12 \text{ tires} \times 40 \text{ dollars/tire} = 480 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total earnings on Friday are:
\[ 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Comparing the earnings from both days, Thursday's earnings are $520 and Friday's earnings are $480. Therefore, the earnings were highest on Thursday. The difference in earnings between Thursday and Friday is:

mgsm-fr-54,"Translation: The Doubtfire sisters leave the local animal shelter with 7 adopted kittens in their car. On the way back, their mother calls to inform them that their two domestic cats have had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family have now?

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens from Patchy and Trixie, and then add them to the 7 adopted kittens.

1. The number of kittens from Patchy is three times the number of adopted kittens. Since there are 7 adopted kittens, the number of kittens from Patchy is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

2. The number of kittens from Trixie is given as 12.

3. Adding the number of adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie, we get:

mgsm-fr-56,"Translation: Pierre plans to go to the cinema this week. He always buys a ticket for $7 and $7 worth of popcorn. If he has $42 for the week, how many times can he go to the cinema?

To determine how many times Pierre can go to the cinema, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the cinema and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

1. The cost of one trip to the cinema is the sum of the cost of the ticket and the cost of the popcorn:
   \[
   7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many times Pierre can afford this amount with his $42. We do this by dividing $42 by the cost of one trip:

mgsm-fr-57,"Translation: A delivery truck is about to cross a wooden bridge that cannot support a load of more than 5,000 pounds. The truck is filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To determine how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the maximum additional weight the truck can carry.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this additional weight.

First, we find the maximum additional weight the truck can carry by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this additional weight. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we divide the maximum additional weight by the weight of one box:
\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Therefore, the number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \(\boxed{83}\).",83,83
mgsm-fr-58,"Translation: Stéphane ordered groceries online. The final invoice amounts to $40.00. Since it was a delivery service provider, they added a 25% surcharge and a $3.00 delivery fee. Stéphane also gave a $4.00 tip. Considering the additional charges, what was the final price of Stéphane's order?

To find the final price of Stéphane's order, we need to calculate the surcharge and the delivery fee, and then add the tip to the original invoice amount.

1. Calculate the surcharge:
   The surcharge is 25% of $40.00.
   \[
   \text{Surcharge} = 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00
   \]

2. Add the surcharge to the original invoice amount:
   \[
   \text{New total} = 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00
   \]

3. Add the delivery fee:
   \[
   \text{New total} = 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00
   \]

4. Add the tip:

mgsm-fr-60,"Translation: A basket contains 25 oranges, of which 1 is spoiled, 20% are not ripe, 2 are sour, and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?

To determine the number of good oranges, we need to account for the spoiled, unripe, and sour oranges and subtract their total from the total number of oranges.

1. The total number of oranges is 25.
2. The number of spoiled oranges is 1.
3. The number of unripe oranges is 20% of 25. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5
   \]
4. The number of sour oranges is 2.

Now, we sum the number of spoiled, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[
1 + 5 + 2 = 8
\]

The number of good oranges is the total number of oranges minus the number of spoiled, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[
25 - 8 = 17

1. Calculate the total amount spent on materials and the jewelry maker.
2. Calculate 10% of this total amount for insurance.
3. Add the insurance cost to the total amount spent on materials and the jewelry maker.

First, let's find the total amount spent on materials and the jewelry maker:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate 10% of $1300 for the insurance:
\[ 10\% \times 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total amount spent on materials and the jewelry maker:

If the streaming company charged this amount during the first half of the year, and then 10% less during the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she paid for the streaming service at the end of the year.

To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service at the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the amount charged during the first half of the year:
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the total charge for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. Calculate the amount charged during the second half of the year:
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than $140.
   - 10% of $140 is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the total charge for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:
   - Add the charges for the first half and the second half of the year:
     \[

How many miles can Sophie travel with one full tank of gas?

To find out how many miles Sophie can travel with one full tank of gas, we need to determine her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that she has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[
\text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Now, we need to calculate how many miles she can travel with a full tank of 12 gallons:

\[
\text{Distance with one full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}

Therefore, the amount Sheila will have to pay each month is \(\boxed{255}\).",255,255
mgsm-fr-74,"Question in English: Artie sells flowers at the farmer's market. He sells three types of flowers: violets, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells violets for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Since he doesn't have change today, Artie decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If he sells 12 pots of violets, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he make?

To solve this, we first round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar:
- Violets: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Next, we calculate the total money made from each type of flower:
- Violets: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the total money made:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

So, the total amount of money Artie will make is $\boxed{88}$.",88,88
mgsm-fr-75,"Translation: Luc spends time building sandcastles on the beach. He notices that each level of a sandcastle has half the area of the level below it. What is the average area of a level, knowing that the sandcastle consists of 4 levels and that the highest level has an area of 16 square feet?

To find the average area of a level in the sandcastle, we first need to determine the area of each level. We know that the highest level (the 4th level) has an area of 16 square feet, and each level below it has half the area of the level above it.

Let's denote the area of the 4th level as \( A_4 \), the area of the 3rd level as \( A_3 \), the area of the 2nd level as \( A_2 \), and the area of the 1st level as \( A_1 \).

Given:
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_1 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average area of the levels. The average area is the sum of the areas of all the levels divided by the number of levels. The total area of the sandcastle is:
\[ A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 \text{ square feet} \]

The number of levels is 4, so the average area is:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average area of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60
mgsm-fr-76,"Translation: Cécilia just bought a new puppy. According to the vet, she will need to give the puppy 1 bowl of dog food per day for the first 180 days. Then, she will need to give 2 bowls per day until the end of its life. If a bag of dog food represents 110 bowls, how many bags of dog food will Cécilia use in the first year?

To find out how many bags of dog food Cécilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of food the puppy will consume in the first 180 days.

The puppy will eat 1 bowl of food per day for 180 days. Therefore, the total amount of food consumed in the first 180 days is:
\[ 1 \text{ bowl/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ bowls} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food this amount of food corresponds to. Since each bag contains 110 bowls, we divide the total number of bowls by the number of bowls per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ bowls}}{110 \text{ bowls/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cécilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food to cover the first 180 days.

The final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David, and then find the difference between the two.

1. First, we know that Sara does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Since Sara does 4 times the amount of laundry that David does, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing Sara's amount by 4:
   \[
   \text{Amount of laundry David does} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half the amount of laundry that Sara does, so we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sara's amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Amount of laundry Raymond does} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond does and the amount of laundry David does:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond does and the amount of laundry David does is \(\boxed{100}\).",100,100
mgsm-fr-78,"Translation: Vincent has the choice to buy flower bunches of 3 for $2.50 or bunches of 2 for $1. How much money will he save if he buys 18 flowers at the best price?

To determine the best price and the savings, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at each option and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the bunches of 3 for $2.50:
- He needs 18 flowers, so he will need 18 / 3 = 6 bunches.
- The cost for 6 bunches is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the bunches of 2 for $1.00:
- He needs 18 flowers, so he will need 18 / 2 = 9 bunches.
- The cost for 9 bunches is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The cost at the better price is $9.00.
- The cost at the other price is $15.00.
- The savings is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Vincent will save \boxed{6} dollars.",6,6

First, we calculate how much water each girl received. Since each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]
Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is:

mgsm-fr-82,"Translation: Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. What is, in pounds, the sum of their two weights?

To find the sum of Grace and Alex's weights, we first need to determine Alex's weight. Grace's weight is 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the sum of Grace's and Alex's weights:

mgsm-fr-84,"Translation: A football team played 22 matches. They won _ times more than they lost. How many times did they win?

Let's denote the number of matches the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won \( L \) times more matches than they lost, which means the number of matches they won is \( L + L = 2L \).

The total number of matches played is the sum of the matches won and the matches lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 2L = 22 \]
\[ 3L = 22 \]
\[ L = \frac{22}{3} \]
Since \( L \) must be a whole number (as you can't lose a fraction of a match), we need to check if 22 is divisible by 3. It is not, so let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we are interpreting it correctly. The problem states ""won _ times more than they lost,"" which implies a whole number solution. Let's try to find a whole number solution by checking possible values for \( L \).

If \( L = 6 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 6 + 12 = 18 \), which is not 22.

If \( L = 7 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 7 + 14 = 21 \), which is not 22.

If \( L = 5 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 5 + 10 = 15 \), which is not 22.

If \( L = 4 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 4 + 8 = 12 \), which is not 22.

If \( L = 3 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 3 + 6 = 9 \), which is not 22.

If \( L = 2 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \), which is not 22.

If \( L = 1 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is not 22.

If \( L = 0 \), then the team won \( 2 \times 0 = 0 \) matches. The total number of matches is \( 0 + 0 = 0 \), which is not 22.

Since none of these values work, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the team won twice as many matches as they lost. Let's solve it again:

If the team lost \( L \) matches, they won \( 2L \) matches. The total number of matches is \( L + 2L = 3L = 22 \). Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{22}{3} \), which is not a whole number. The correct interpretation is that the team won twice as many matches as they lost, and the only whole number solution is when the team lost 4 matches and won 14 matches.

Therefore, the team won \( \boxed{14} \) matches.",14,15

How many squares does his quilt have in total?

To find the total number of squares in the quilt, we need to determine how many years Gene has been taking vacation trips and then calculate the total number of squares based on the number of trips per year.

1. Calculate the number of years Gene has been taking vacation trips:
   \[
   34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
   \]

2. Since Gene takes four trips per year, the total number of squares (t-shirts) is:

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First time the alarm rang:**
   - It rang 4 times.

2. **Second time the alarm rang:**
   - It rang three times longer than the first time.

If Sylvie just completed 5 years at the company last December, what will her annual salary be after three more years of service?

To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sylvie's initial monthly salary.
2. Determine her monthly salary after five years of service.
3. Calculate her monthly salary after an additional three years of service.
4. Compute her annual salary after eight years of service.

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's initial monthly salary.**
Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.

**Step 2: Determine her monthly salary after five years of service.**
After five years of service, she qualifies for a 10% increase in her salary.
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 600 + 0.10 \times 600 = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 3: Calculate her monthly salary after an additional three years of service.**
Since her salary does not change further after the initial five years, her monthly salary remains $660.

**Step 4: Compute her annual salary after eight years of service.**

He knows that he will need 10 pounds of salad for an adult dinosaur and half of that quantity for a child. If there are 20 adults and 5 children present at the picnic, how many kilos of potato salad does Ted need to bring to hope to feed everyone?

To find out how many kilos of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the total amount of salad required for the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount of salad needed for the adults:
   - Each adult needs 10 pounds of salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total salad for adults = \( 10 \text{ pounds/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ pounds} \).

2. Calculate the amount of salad needed for the children:
   - Each child needs half the amount of salad needed for an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total salad for children = \( 5 \text{ pounds/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ pounds} \).

3. Calculate the total amount of salad needed:
   - Total salad = salad for adults + salad for children = \( 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds} \).

4. Convert the total amount of salad from pounds to kilos:
   - 1 pound = 0.453592 kilos.
   - Total salad in kilos = \( 225 \text{ pounds} \times 0.453592 \text{ kilos/pound} \approx 102.06 \text{ kilos} \).

To determine the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the 150% increase.
2. Subtract the total investment (purchase price plus restoration cost) from the new value of the house.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original value of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase means the value increases by 1.5 times the original value. So, the increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]
Adding this increase to the original value gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to subtract the total investment from the new value of the house. The total investment is the sum of the purchase price and the restoration cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]
So, the profit is:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of food given to the chickens each day and then find out how much food is given in the last meal.

First, we know that Wendi gives each chicken 3 bowls of food per day. Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total amount of food given per day is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ bowls/chicken} = 60 \text{ bowls} \]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 bowls in the morning and 25 bowls in the afternoon. So, the total amount of food given in the first two meals is:

To find out how much food is given in the last meal, we subtract the amount given in the first two meals from the total daily amount:
\[ 60 \text{ bowls} - 40 \text{ bowls} = 20 \text{ bowls} \]

Therefore, the number of bowls of food Wendi should give them for the last meal of the day is:

mgsm-fr-5,"Translation: Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay for them?

To solve this, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses with the given pricing structure. We know that every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying. 

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

So, Kylar is buying 8 pairs of glasses, and each pair costs $8. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar will have to pay $64 for the 16 glasses. 

The final answer is $\boxed{64}$.",64,64
mgsm-fr-6,"Translation: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, how many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total?

To solve this, we start by determining the number of sheep each city has based on the given information.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have is $\boxed{260}$.",260,260
mgsm-fr-7,"Translation: Carla is downloading a file that is 200 GB in size. She downloads at a speed of 2 GB per minute, but at 40% of the download, Windows requires a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file?

To solve this, we first calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file and then the remaining 60%.

1. Time to download 40% of the file:
   \[
   0.4 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
   \]
   Since the download speed is 2 GB per minute:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Time for the Windows update and restart:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the total time required to download the file is $\boxed{120}$ minutes.",120,160
mgsm-fr-8,"Question in English: Jean drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns back after realizing he forgot something very important at home. He tries to get back in 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in traffic jams. For the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph for the rest of the 4 hours. What distance separates him from his home at the end of the 4 hours?

To determine the distance Jean is from his home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in both directions and then find the net distance.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Return Trip:**
   - First 2 hours in traffic: Distance = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles (no progress)
   - Next 30 minutes at 30 mph: Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles
   - Remaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours at 80 mph: Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance to home + Distance back - Distance already traveled
   - Total distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

4. **Net Distance from Home:**
   - Net distance = Distance to home - Distance back
   - Net distance = 180 miles - (15 miles + 120 miles) = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

Thus, the distance that separates Jean from his home at the end of the 4 hours is $\boxed{45}$ miles.",45,45

To calculate Elisa's weekly salary, we need to break down her hours into regular and overtime hours and then compute the total pay.

1. Calculate the pay for the first 40 hours:
   \[
   40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}

It then decreased by 30% in the third month. How many times in total was the program downloaded over these three months?

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First month**: The program was downloaded 60 times.
2. **Second month**: The number of downloads was three times the first month. So, the number of downloads in the second month is:

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of beignets:**
   - Number of dozens: 3
   - Price per dozen: $68
   \[
   \text{Total cost for beignets} = 3 \times 68 = 204 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of small cakes:**
   - Number of dozens: 2
   - Price per dozen: $80

The watering and fertilizing of the tree cost $3 per year. How many years will it take Carlos to start making a profit with his lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue over time.

First, let's calculate the annual profit:
- Revenue per year: \(7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5\)
- Annual cost: \$3 (watering and fertilizing)
- Annual profit: \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5

Next, we need to find out how many years it will take for the total profit to cover the initial planting cost of \$90.
- Let \(n\) be the number of years.
- Total profit after \(n\) years: \(7.5n\)
- We need \(7.5n \geq 90\)

Solving for \(n\):
\[7.5n \geq 90\]
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\]
\[n \geq 12\]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making a profit with his lemon tree.

mgsm-fr-13,"Translation: Mélanie sells vacuum cleaners door-to-door. During her visit to the Green House, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, then 2 more to the Red House, and finally half of what was left to the Orange House. If Mélanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she have to start with?

To determine how many vacuum cleaners Mélanie had initially, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as \( x \).
2. After selling a third of her vacuum cleaners to the Green House, Mélanie has \( \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the Red House, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. Finally, she sold half of what was left to the Orange House, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. We know that after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
6. To clear the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
7. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
8. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
9. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18

Thus, Mélanie initially had \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners.",18,18
mgsm-fr-14,"Translation: In a dance class with 20 students, 20% are enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% in jazz dance, and the rest in hip-hop dance. What is the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance?

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first calculate the percentages for contemporary and jazz dance:

- Contemporary dance: \(20\%\) of 20 students is \(0.20 \times 20 = 4\) students.
- Jazz dance: \(25\%\) of 20 students is \(0.25 \times 20 = 5\) students.

Next, we determine the number of students in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

- Total students: 20
- Students in contemporary and jazz dance: \(4 + 5 = 9\)
- Students in hip-hop dance: \(20 - 9 = 11\)

Now, we calculate the percentage of students in hip-hop dance:

\[
\text{Percentage of hip-hop dance students} = \left(\frac{11}{20}\right) \times 100\% = 55\%

A merchant is considering two purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates on a 2.5% increase in the jewelry market and a 1.2% increase in the electronic gadgets market during the same month. If the merchant chooses the option that maximizes his profit at the end of the month, what would be the amount of this profit?

Answer in English and enclose the final number in \boxed{}:
To determine which option maximizes the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the profit for each option after the expected increase in value.

For the jewelry:
- Initial value: $5,000
- Expected increase: 2.5%
- New value: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
- Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial value: $8,000
- Expected increase: 1.2%
- New value: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
- Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits, the profit from the jewelry is $125 and the profit from the electronic gadgets is $96. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit.

The amount of the profit is \boxed{125}.",125,125

To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from being a teacher:
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She earns $20 per hour.

The total hours worked as a teacher per year is:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 1750 \text{ hours/year} \]

The total earnings from being a teacher is:
\[ 1750 \text{ hours/year} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 35000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a majorette coach:
- Jill works 15 hours per week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She earns $30 per hour.

The total hours worked as a coach per year is:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 750 \text{ hours/year} \]

The total earnings from being a coach is:
\[ 750 \text{ hours/year} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 22500 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, we sum up her earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \text{ dollars/year} + 22500 \text{ dollars/year} = 57500 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is \(\boxed{57500}\).",57500,57500

To answer this question, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks. Since she eats 3 eggs every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the number of eggs she eats in one week as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she will consume in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the number of dozen eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{7}\).",7,7

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to maintain for the remaining distance?

To find the speed Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance, we first calculate the total time she should take to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total distance is 12 miles, so the total time required is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles) on the trail, so she has:

To solve this problem, we will first determine the amount of water in the original orange juice and pineapple juice, then account for the spilled orange juice, and finally calculate the total amount of water in the remaining mixture.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the original orange juice:**
   - The orange juice is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
   \[
   \text{Water in orange juice} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}

   - The pineapple juice is 15 liters, and three-quarters of it is water.
   \[
   \text{Water in pineapple juice} = \frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water in the spilled orange juice:**
   - One liter of orange juice is spilled, and it is composed of \(\frac{2}{3}\) water.
   \[
   \text{Water in spilled orange juice} = \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \text{ liters}

4. **Calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange juice after spilling:**
   - Subtract the water from the spilled orange juice from the original amount of water in the orange juice.
   \[
   \text{Remaining water in orange juice} = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ liters}

Each carton contains 15 portions. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total number of portions by the number of portions per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ portions}}{15 \text{ portions/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16

To find out how many miles Henri rode between the two stops, we need to determine the distances of the two stops and then find the difference between them.

1. The first stop was after 20 miles.
2. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, the second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (45 miles):
\[45 - 20 = 25\]

So, Henri rode \(\boxed{25}\) miles between the two stops.",25,25
mgsm-fr-29,"Translation: While she is buying shoes, Gloria comes across a pair of boots that fit within her budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that cost five dollars less than the boots in total. If one of the pairs of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, what is the price of the boots in dollars?

Let's denote the price of the boots as \( B \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 2 \times 33 = 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. According to the problem, this total cost is five dollars less than the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the price of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 = 104 \]

So, the price of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars.",104,104
mgsm-fr-30,"Translate the question into English:
""The ages of Darell and Allen are in the ratio of 7:11. If the sum of their current ages is 162, calculate Allen's age in 10 years.""

To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let the age of Darell be \(7x\) and the age of Allen be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find the current age of Allen. Since Allen's age is \(11x\):

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109

To find the average of the estimations, we first need to determine each friend's estimate.

1. The first friend's estimate is 80.
2. The second friend's estimate is 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's estimate} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's estimate is 25% more than the first friend's estimate. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's estimate} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the three estimates: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these estimates and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

Let's denote the number of silver pieces as \( S \) and the number of gold pieces as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of pieces is 110.
2. The number of gold pieces is 30 more than the number of silver pieces.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver pieces, we can find the number of gold pieces using the second equation:

1. Determine how many pieces of jewelry Aaron has.
2. Use the number of pieces Aaron has to find out how many pieces Siobhan has.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 pieces of jewelry. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more pieces than half the number of pieces of jewelry that Raymond has. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewelry and then add 5:

\[
\text{Half of Raymond's jewelry} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]
\[
\text{Aaron's jewelry} = 20 + 5 = 25

To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we first need to determine the cost of the yogurts he consumes each day and then extend that to 30 days.

1. Calculate the daily cost of yogurt:
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - The price is 4 yogurts for 5.00 dollars.
   - Therefore, the cost of 2 yogurts is half the cost of 4 yogurts, which is \(\frac{5.00}{4} \times 2 = 2.50\) dollars.

2. Calculate the total cost for 30 days:
   - Since Terry spends 2.50 dollars each day, over 30 days he will spend \(2.50 \times 30 = 75.00\) dollars.

So, the amount of money Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is \(\boxed{75.00}\).",0,75

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Jean gets from selling the Lego sets.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Jean spends on video games.
3. Determine how much money Jean has left after buying the video games.
4. Use the remaining money to find out how many Lego sets Jean can buy and how many he has left.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Jean gets from selling the Lego sets.
Jean sells 13 Lego sets at $15 each.
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]
So, Jean gets $195 from selling the Lego sets.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jean spends on video games.
Jean buys 8 video games at $20 each.
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]
So, Jean spends $160 on video games.

Step 3: Determine how much money Jean has left after buying the video games.
Jean starts with $195 and spends $160.
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \]
So, Jean has $35 left after buying the video games.

Step 4: Use the remaining money to find out how many Lego sets Jean can buy and how many he has left.
Jean has $35 left and each Lego set costs $15.
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{35}{15} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

mgsm-fr-38,"Translation: Jean runs 60 miles each week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and runs half as much on each of the other two days. What is his running speed?

To find Jean's running speed, we need to determine the distance he runs each day and then calculate his average speed over the week.

First, let's denote the distance Jean runs on the first day as \(d_1\). Since he runs for 3 hours on the first day, we can express \(d_1\) as:
\[d_1 = 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} = 3s\]
where \(s\) is his running speed in miles per hour.

On the second and third days, he runs half as much as on the first day, so the distance he runs each of these days is:
\[d_2 = d_3 = \frac{d_1}{2} = \frac{3s}{2}\]

The total distance Jean runs in a week is the sum of the distances he runs each day:
\[d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 3s + \frac{3s}{2} + \frac{3s}{2} = 3s + 3s = 6s\]

We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles, so we can set up the equation:
\[6s = 60\]

Solving for \(s\), we get:
\[s = \frac{60}{6} = 10\]

Therefore, Jean's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10

To determine how many miles Dana travels in six hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's jumping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Since she jumps half as fast as she runs, her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
   - Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Dana spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of her time running.
   - Dana spends \(\frac{2}{3}\) of her time walking.
   - In six hours, the time spent running is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - In six hours, the time spent walking is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled for each activity:**
   - Distance traveled while running: \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\).
   - Distance traveled while walking: \(1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance traveled while running + distance traveled while walking = \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}\).

Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but only over a distance of 400 feet, which was well within the dragon's reach. However, when Polly held the sapphire stone, she could throw the javelin three times farther. With the precious stone in hand, how far could Polly stay out of the dragon's reach while still being able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin?

Answer: When Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, which means she can throw it \(400 \times 3 = 1,200\) feet. Since the dragon can only breathe fire up to 1,000 feet, Polly can stay \(1,200 - 1,000 = 200\) feet away from the dragon and still be able to hit it with the javelin.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.**

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees will be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.**

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 4: Find the remaining number of trees.**

The remaining number of trees is:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the number of trees Tom has left is \(\boxed{91}\).",91,91
mgsm-fr-193,"Translation: Sue lives in a neighborhood where everyone is in a good mood. During a certain weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on her. On Friday morning, they placed 18 plastic flamingos in her garden. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took a third of the plastic flamingos and painted them white, then put them back in Sue's garden. Then, on Sunday morning, they added 18 more plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more plastic flamingos were there than white ones?

To solve the problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of each type of flamingo at the end of Sunday.

1. **Initial number of plastic flamingos on Friday morning:**
   \[
   18
   \]

2. **Number of plastic flamingos taken and painted white on Saturday morning:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]
   So, 6 plastic flamingos were painted white and put back in the garden.

3. **Number of plastic flamingos remaining in the garden after Saturday morning:**
   \[
   18 - 6 = 12
   \]

4. **Number of plastic flamingos added on Sunday morning:**
   \[
   18
   \]
   So, the total number of plastic flamingos in the garden on Sunday morning is:
   \[
   12 + 18 = 30

5. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   \[
   6
   \]

6. **Difference between the number of plastic flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   \[
   30 - 6 = 24
   \]

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were \(\boxed{24}\) more plastic flamingos than white ones.",24,24
mgsm-fr-194,"Translation: Violetta wants to buy new pencils. She needs them in 5 different colors and has planned to spend $20 on this purchase. Knowing that one pencil costs $2, how much change will she have? 

To solve this, we first calculate the total cost of the pencils Violetta needs. Since she needs 5 pencils and each pencil costs $2, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 2 \text{ dollars per pencil} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Violetta has $20 to spend. After buying the pencils, the amount of money she will have left (the change) is:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of change Violetta will have is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10
mgsm-fr-195,"Translation: A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser together. If a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, what will be the price of 8 pens?

To find the price of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, the cost of one pen is equal to the sum of the cost of one pencil and one eraser. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of one pencil} + \text{Cost of one eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now that we know the cost of one pen is $1.50, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Thus, the price of 8 pens is \(\boxed{12.00}\).",0,12
mgsm-fr-196,"Translation: We need to distribute 200 pounds of carrots to 40 restaurants in a certain city. If each restaurant must receive 2 pounds of carrots, how many pounds of carrots will not be used?

To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available to find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]",120,120

To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

First, we calculate the total number of men and women:
\[ 8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509 \]

Next, we subtract this number from the total population to find the number of children:
\[ 23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277 \]

mgsm-fr-198,"Translation: At the beginning, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards. She collected three times more at the end of a month. During the second month, she collected 20 cards less than what she collected in the first month. Finally, during the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months. How many Pokemon cards does she have now?

Solution:
1. At the beginning, Elaine had 20 cards.
2. At the end of the first month, she collected three times more, which means she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. During the second month, she collected 20 cards less than what she collected in the first month, which means she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. During the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards collected in the first two months. The total number of cards collected in the first two months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards in the third month.
5. To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we sum the cards she had at the beginning and the cards she collected each month: \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\).

mgsm-fr-199,"Translation: Marc is a proofreader. He revises the same number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who pay him at different rates. Publisher B pays Marc twice as much as Publisher A. Marc edits a total of 1,000 sentences per week, while Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Marc earn in a week, in cents?

Solution:
Let's denote the number of sentences Marc revises for each publisher as \( x \). Since he revises the same number of sentences for each publisher, he revises \( x \) sentences for Publisher A and \( x \) sentences for Publisher B, making a total of \( 2x \) sentences. We know that the total number of sentences he revises per week is 1,000, so we have:
\[ 2x = 1000 \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Marc revises 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so the amount he earns from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so he earns 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B. Therefore, the amount he earns from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the amounts from both publishers, Marc's total earnings per week are:
\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final answer is:

Answer: To find out how many liters of water Baldur collects each day, we need to calculate the total number of buckets he draws and then multiply by the amount of water each bucket contains.

- In the morning, he draws 5 buckets.
- In the afternoon, he draws 6 buckets.
- Therefore, the total number of buckets he draws each day is \(5 + 6 = 11\).
- Since each bucket contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he collects each day is \(11 \times 5 = 55\) liters.

So, the number of liters of water Baldur collects each day is \(\boxed{55}\).",55,55

To determine how much money Jean earned that year, we need to calculate his total earnings from his regular salary and the bonus, and then add the one-time bonus to his regular earnings for the year.

1. Calculate Jean's regular weekly salary:
   \[
   \text{Regular weekly salary} = \$2,000
   \]

2. Calculate Jean's regular annual salary:
   \[
   \text{Regular annual salary} = \$2,000 \times 52 = \$104,000
   \]

3. Calculate the new salary after the 5% increase:
   \[
   \text{New weekly salary} = \$2,000 \times 1.05 = \$2,100
   \]

4. Calculate the new annual salary after the 5% increase:
   \[
   \text{New annual salary} = \$2,100 \times 52 = \$109,200
   \]

5. Since Jean received the bonus on the first day of the year, he earned the bonus for the entire year. Therefore, the total earnings for the year are the new annual salary plus the one-time bonus:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \$109,200 + \$5,000 = \$114,200

To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the total amount of grapes into barrels of wine.

First, we calculate the total amount of grapes produced per year. Since Josie's farm is 10 acres and she produces 5 tons of grapes per acre per year, the total amount of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we convert the total amount of grapes into barrels of wine. Since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

He also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days of the week, using one more slice per omelet than he used per sandwich. He made a large cheese macaroni dish for several dinners this week and used 8 slices of cheese in its preparation. How many slices of cheese did he use in total?

To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total, we need to calculate the cheese usage for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Lunch (sandwiches):**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day of the week (7 days).
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for lunch: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast (omelets):**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days of the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 slice more than a sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for breakfast: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Dinner (macaroni):**
   - Carl made a large cheese macaroni dish and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for dinner: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[ 14 \text{ slices (lunch)} + 9 \text{ slices (breakfast)} + 8 \text{ slices (dinner)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\).",31,31

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pens Janet has after her purchase.

First, we know Janet initially had:
- 22 green pens
- 10 yellow pens

So, the initial total number of pens is:
\[ 22 + 10 = 32 \]

Next, Janet bought:
- 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens
- 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens

The total number of blue pens she bought is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

The total number of red pens she bought is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Adding these to the initial total, the new total number of pens Janet has is:
\[ 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

Thus, the final number of pens Janet has is \(\boxed{98}\).",98,98
mgsm-fr-205,"Translation: Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. He gives six tests per semester. He allows students to drop their lowest average from each semester. If, after the first five tests, Brinley has scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, what score must she get on the sixth test to have an average of 93?

To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to have an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score from the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total score needed for the remaining four tests (including the sixth test) to achieve an average of 93.
3. Determine the required score on the sixth test.

First, let's identify the lowest score from the first five tests:
The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

If we drop the lowest score (71), the total score needed for the remaining four tests to achieve an average of 93 is:
\[ 93 \times 4 = 372 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of the scores of the remaining four tests (89, 92, 100, and \( x \)) must be 372. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + x = 372 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 281 + x = 372 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 372 - 281 \]
\[ x = 91 \]

Thus, Brinley must score \(\boxed{91}\) on her sixth test to have an average of 93.",93,98

He did this for four weeks, then decided to do it only 2 times a week, but riding 60 kilometers each time, which he did for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Michael ride in total?

To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the distance Michael rode in the first four weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ times/week} \times 25 \text{ km/time} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Michael rode in the following three weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 60 \text{ km/time} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:

To find the weight of Joe's candy bag, we need to calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the gummy fruits, and then sum these weights.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a gummy fruit. Therefore, the weight of each gummy fruit is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Since there are 80 gummy fruits, the total weight of the gummy fruits is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the gummy fruits gives us the total weight of the candy bag:

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times as many cakes as on Monday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times the quantity of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(12 \times 5 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes bought each day:

mgsm-fr-209,"Translation: Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of a half-dozen plates sold for $6000 each. Calculate the price of one cup.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of one cup. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total cost of a half-dozen plates.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a half-dozen plates} = 6000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Let the cost of one dozen cups be \( C \). Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 20C
   \]

3. According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of a half-dozen plates. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   20C = 6000 - 1200
   \]
   Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   \[
   20C = 4800
   \]

4. To find the cost of one dozen cups, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:
   \[
   C = \frac{4800}{20} = 240
   \]
   So, the cost of one dozen cups is $240. Therefore, the cost of one cup is:

Sara babysits for her neighbor 4 times and earns $5 each time. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already had $10 in savings before starting to babysit, how many times does she need to mow the lawn before she can afford the coat and the shoes?

To solve this, we first calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- Cost of the coat: $30
- Cost of 2 pairs of shoes: $20 × 2 = $40
- Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Next, we determine how much more money Sara needs after accounting for her initial savings:
- Initial savings: $10
- Total needed: $70
- Additional money needed: $70 - $10 = $60

Now, we calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Earnings from babysitting: $5 × 4 = $20
- Let \( x \) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn.
- Earnings from mowing the lawn: $4x

The total earnings from both activities must equal the additional money needed:
\[ 20 + 4x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 4x = 60 - 20 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times.",10,10

Let's denote the number of red hens as \( r \) and the number of white hens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. The total number of eggs produced per day is 42.
2. The number of white hens is two more than the number of red hens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The equation for the total number of eggs produced per day is:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S \) gallons. Then, the amount of water in the large pool 4 minutes ago was \( 2S \) gallons.

Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, the small pool will have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water, and the large pool will have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S - 16 \) gallons, and the current amount of water in the large pool is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the large pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 2S - 4S = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2S = -48 \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Since it has lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is \(\boxed{8}\) gallons.",8,8

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months.
\[ \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total repayment amount from the initial loan amount to find out how much money will be left.**

Since the total repayment amount ($2200) is more than the total payment ($1980), Janeth will not have any money left. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, the amount of money left for Janeth is:

To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is $\boxed{15}$.",15,15

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by 3:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

Thus, the average age that the three will have in three years is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
mgsm-fr-219,"Translation: Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 points more than half of Naomi's score, and Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score?

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to determine the scores of Yuri and Brianna first, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Calculate Yuri's score:
   Naomi's score is 68 points. Half of Naomi's score is:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Yuri scored 10 points more than this:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

2. Calculate Brianna's score:
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

3. Calculate Jojo's score:
   The total score of the four students is 251 points. We know the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, so we can find Jojo's score by subtracting their scores from the total:
   \[
   251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54

To find out how many minutes Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles and Sudoku puzzles separately and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
\[ 3 \text{ puzzles} \times 10 \text{ minutes per puzzle} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
\[ 8 \text{ puzzles} \times 5 \text{ minutes per puzzle} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:

To solve the problem, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. Determine how much water is left in the tank after Céline used 90 liters.
2. Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.
3. Add the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining water in the tank after Céline used 90 liters.
The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. After using 90 liters, the remaining water is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Step 2: Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.
The rainwater collected is twice the amount of water that was left in the tank after Céline used some. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Step 3: Add the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank.
The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the remaining water and the rainwater collected:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

Answer: To find out the total number of flowers Andy planted, we first need to determine the number of petunias he planted. Since he planted 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, Andy planted a total of $\boxed{140}$ flowers.",140,140

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Next, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent over the two years:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000

To find the total amount spent on rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add the two amounts together.

First, we calculate the cost for Carlos:
\[
\text{Cost for Carlos} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for Benji:
\[
\text{Cost for Benji} = 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Next, we add the time for the bus trip and the car trip to find the total travel time:

Answer: First, we need to calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes. Initially, James has 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) water type cards. He buys 14 more grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes \(20 + 14 = 34\). The number of fire type cards remains 30.

Now, we calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[32 \text{ (water)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 30 \text{ (fire)} = 96 \text{ cards}\]

Next, we find the probability that a randomly chosen card is water type. This is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333\]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33.33\]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest whole number, we get 33. Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly chosen card is water type is:

To calculate the total cost:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Meat: $2.00
3. Cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. Sauces: $0.25 x 2 = $0.50

To solve this, we first need to determine how many pieces Kalinda's mother can place per minute. Since her mother places two times fewer pieces than Kalinda, her mother places \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces they can place together per minute. Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute and her mother places 2 pieces per minute, so together they place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for them to place all 360 pieces. Since they place 6 pieces per minute, the time required in minutes is \( \frac{360}{6} = 60 \) minutes.

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time required in hours is \( \frac{60}{60} = 1 \) hour.

Two weeks later, back at home, 3/4 of the remaining pumpkins were ready, and she harvested them. How many pumpkins were not yet ready for harvest after these two weeks?

First, we calculate the number of pumpkins that were ready to be harvested initially:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

After taking 36 pumpkins home, the number of pumpkins remaining at the farm is:

mgsm-fr-141,"Translation: A hive has 700 bees. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. How many worker bees are there?

To solve this problem, we can define the number of each type of bee in terms of a variable. Let's denote the number of queen bees by \( q \). According to the problem, the number of baby bees is twice the number of queen bees, so we can denote the number of baby bees by \( 2q \). The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so we can denote the number of worker bees by \( 2 \times 2q = 4q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7q = 700 \]
To find \( q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queen bees is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

First, let's determine how many hours Jordan would spend working in a week if he stopped playing video games:
- Jordan plays video games for 2 hours each day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total time spent on video games in a week is \(2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week}\).

To solve this, we first identify the food items and the non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items, so their cost is 2$ + 3$ = 5$. The bulbs, cups, and cockroach traps are non-food items, so their cost is 3$ + 3$ + 4$ = 10$. A 10% tax is applied to the non-food items, so the tax on the non-food items is 10% of 10$, which is 1$. Therefore, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is 10$ + 1$ = 11$. Adding the cost of the food items, the total cost is 5$ + 11$ = 16$.

She calculates that her total weekly income will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. How much profit, in dollars, will Kim make each week?

To find Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate her total expenses and subtract them from her total income.

First, let's determine the number of clients she will be serving:
\[ 3 \text{ (existing clients)} + 5 \text{ (potential clients)} = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for each client:

To solve this, we first need to determine how many Facebook friends Dorothée has. Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothée and Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of friends Dorothée has} = \frac{\text{Number of friends Charlie has}}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothée has 4 Facebook friends. Now, we need to find out how many Facebook friends Jacques has. Since Jacques has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothée, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Number of friends Jacques has} = 4 \times \text{Number of friends Dorothée has} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Jacques has \(\boxed{16}\) Facebook friends.",16,16
mgsm-fr-150,"Translation: Steve and Tim decide to see who can get back to school the fastest. Steve lives farther than Tim and is allowed to use his bicycle. Steve lives 3 miles from school and rides at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school. If Tim moves on a skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get back to school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance to school: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Speed: 440 feet per minute
- Time to get back to school: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

For Tim:
- Distance to school: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)
- Speed: 264 feet per minute
- Time to get back to school: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get back to school. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get back to school. The difference in time is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will wait at home for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

mgsm-fr-151,"Translation: Shawnda thinks that a bicycle tire inflation service would be very useful for the children in her neighborhood. She decides to charge per tire. Each tire inflation costs 25 cents. On the first day, 5 people came to inflate the two tires of each of their bicycles. 3 people came to inflate all the tires of their tricycles. Finally, one person came with a monocycle. How much money did she make that day?

Answer: First, calculate the earnings from the bicycles. Since each bicycle has 2 tires and each tire costs 25 cents, the cost to inflate the tires of one bicycle is $25 \times 2 = 50$ cents. With 5 bicycles, the total earnings from the bicycles are $50 \times 5 = 250$ cents.

Next, calculate the earnings from the tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, so the cost to inflate the tires of one tricycle is $25 \times 3 = 75$ cents. With 3 tricycles, the total earnings from the tricycles are $75 \times 3 = 225$ cents.

Finally, calculate the earnings from the monocycle. A monocycle has 2 tires, so the cost to inflate the tires of the monocycle is $25 \times 2 = 50$ cents.

Adding all the earnings together, we get $250 + 225 + 50 = 525$ cents. Converting cents to dollars, we have $525$ cents $= 5.25$ dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Shawnda made that day is $\boxed{5.25}$.",25,5

To find the total cost of the cookies, we first calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/cookie} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Carl pays with a 10 dollar bill, so the change he receives is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of change Carl receives is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
mgsm-fr-153,"Translation: Dave bought a large bag of fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull snatched the bag from his hands. When the seagull landed, it ate half the amount of fries that Dave had eaten. Then, three pigeons chased the seagull away and each of them managed to eat three fries. Later, a weasel stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Finally, ants carried away the last one, leaving five fries. How many fries were in the bag when Dave bought it?

To find out how many fries were in the bag initially, let's denote the initial number of fries as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the number of fries left is \( x - 14 \).
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the number of fries left is \( x - 21 - 3 \times 3 = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A weasel stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = \frac{x - 30}{3} \).
5. Finally, ants carried away the last one, leaving 5 fries, so we have \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of fries in the bag is \( \boxed{48} \).",48,48

To find out how many hours Kimo spends on his classes during a semester, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of class and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on his classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 3 one-hour classes.
- There are 3 days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
- Therefore, the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\).

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on his classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 2 two-hour classes.
- There are 2 days in a week (Tuesday, Thursday).
- Therefore, the total number of hours per week on these days is \(2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\).

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends on his classes per week:
- The total number of hours per week is \(9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\).

Since there are 16 weeks of school per semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends on his classes during a semester is:
- The total number of hours per semester is \(17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks/semester} = 272 \text{ hours/semester}\).

Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{272}$.",272,272
mgsm-fr-155,"Translation: Each day, Bill prepares 300 small loaves of bread, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. The small loaves of bread measure 4 inches each, the chocolate croissants 6 inches each, and the baguettes 2 feet each. If Bill lines up all the bakery products end to end, what will their total length be in feet?

To find the total length of all the bakery products lined up end to end, we need to calculate the length of each type of product and then sum these lengths.

First, let's calculate the total length of the small loaves of bread in inches:
\[ 300 \text{ small loaves} \times 4 \text{ inches per loaf} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants in inches:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches per croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes in inches. Since each baguette is 2 feet long and there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 24 inches long:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches per baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we sum the lengths of all the products in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches per foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the total length of all the bakery products lined up end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet.",280,280

To find out how many bananas the keeper must order, we need to add the number of bananas required for each type of monkey and then multiply by the number of times this amount is needed in 2 months.

First, we calculate the total number of bananas needed for one month:
\[ 200 \text{ (bananas for macaques)} + 400 \text{ (bananas for gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (bananas for baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the keeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the keeper must order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas.",1400,1400
mgsm-fr-157,"Translation: Blake and Kelly are competing to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do this on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake does 15 round trips. Kelly does one round trip, then decides she does not want to run next to Blake. She starts doing the round trip but limits herself to the 40-yard line. She does this 34 times. How many more yards did the winner run than the loser?

To determine who ran more and by how many yards, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake ran:
- Each round trip on a 100-yard field is \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards.
- Blake did 15 round trips.
- Therefore, Blake ran \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly ran:
- Kelly did one full round trip (100 yards each way) and then 34 round trips on the 40-yard line.
- The distance for one full round trip is \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards.
- The distance for each of the 34 round trips on the 40-yard line is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly ran is \(200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake ran 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran 2920 yards.
- The difference in distance is \(3000 - 2920 = 80\) yards.

Thus, the winner (Blake) ran 80 more yards than the loser (Kelly).

The final answer is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80

On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet, making the total depth 17 + 7 = 24 feet. On Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so we calculate two-thirds of 24 feet as follows:

\[
\text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}

To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught together, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by each person and then sum them up.

First, let's determine how many of each type of fish Locsin caught:
- Sea stars: Anakin caught 10, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) sea stars.
- Seahorses: Anakin caught 6, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) seahorses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Sea stars: Anakin caught 10 and Locsin caught 5, so together they caught \(10 + 5 = 15\) sea stars.
- Seahorses: Anakin caught 6 and Locsin caught 3, so together they caught \(6 + 3 = 9\) seahorses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 and Locsin caught 5, so together they caught \(3 + 5 = 8\) clownfish.

Finally, we sum up all the fish they caught:
\[15 \text{ (sea stars)} + 9 \text{ (seahorses)} + 8 \text{ (clownfish)} = 32\]

mgsm-fr-162,"Translation: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the compounded increase in price over 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine how many 2-month periods there are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

The price increases by 20% every 2 months, which means the price is multiplied by \(1.20\) every 2 months. Therefore, after 18 periods, the price will be:
\[ 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:

1. Calculate the cost of the 5 red cars:
   Each red car costs $4, so the total cost for the cars is:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}

To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of doing the tax returns herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

1. Calculate the cost of doing the tax returns herself:
   - She loses 3 hours of freelance work.
   - The loss per hour is $35.
   - Therefore, the total loss is \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 cream pies.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to get 9 eggs from her neighbor to have enough eggs.
3. Since each time she watches the child, she gets 9 eggs, we need to find out how many times she needs to watch the child to get the required number of eggs.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is 2 times older than Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In two years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):

The minimum payment on her student loan is $300 per month, the minimum payment on her credit card is $200 per month, and the minimum payment on her mortgage is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much must she pay in a year?

To find out how much Jessica must pay in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then add 50% to it.

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she will pay:
\[ 1000 \times 1.5 = 1500 \text{ dollars per month} \]

To find out how much she must pay in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

mgsm-fr-174,"Translation: Billy peels and cuts potatoes to prepare a potato salad for his big family barbecue. As it's an important event, he has 60 potatoes to peel. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut them. It takes Billy about one and a half minutes to peel a potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long does it take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes?

To answer the question, we need to calculate the total time Billy spends peeling and cutting the potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time spent peeling the potatoes:
- Billy has 60 potatoes to peel.
- It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, the total time spent peeling is \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting the potatoes:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, the total time spent cutting is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds.
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes.

Now, we add the time spent peeling and cutting:
- Total time = time spent peeling + time spent cutting = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes.

So, the total time it takes Billy to finish preparing the potatoes is \(\boxed{95}\) minutes.",95,95
mgsm-fr-175,"Translation: Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell each glass for $0.50. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

To solve this, we need to determine the total revenue, total cost, and then find out how much they spent on lemons.

1. Calculate the total revenue:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ glasses} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/glass} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they sold. Since they get 20 glasses from each gallon, we have:
   \[
   x \times 20 = 20 \implies x = 1 \text{ gallon}
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times x + 2 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times x = 3x + 2x = 5x = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   However, the problem states they made a profit of $25, which means there might be an error in the interpretation of the problem or an additional cost not considered. But based on the given information and the logical steps, the cost of lemons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times 1 \text{ gallon} = 3 \text{ dollars}

To find the number of girls in the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of Chinese participants in the race.
2. Subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls.

First, we calculate the number of Chinese participants. Since the total number of Asian participants is 240 and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls in the Chinese team is:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

mgsm-fr-177,"Question in English: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on his car fuel, and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives $200 to his daughter for weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 per month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?

To solve this problem, we will calculate Zaid's expenses step by step and subtract them from his monthly salary.

1. **Calculate the rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the donation to the charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.

1. First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs.
   \[
   \text{Bo's crabs} = 40
   \]

2. Monique has 4 crabs less than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monique has as follows:
   \[
   \text{Monique's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. Rani has 8 more crabs than Monique. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 8 = 44
   \]

4. Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monique's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 44 = 120

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20

She had also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the quantity of white carnations. Sandra threatened to change her supplier if the missing red roses are not delivered before 5 PM. To keep Sandra as a customer, how many red roses must Fred deliver before 5 PM?

To find out how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to determine the number of white carnations first. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( x \). According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the quantity of white carnations. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 200 = 5x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses she ordered is:

\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Let's denote the number of red roses delivered as \( y \). Since Sandra ordered 160 red roses and she is missing some, the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver is:

\[ 160 - y \]

To keep Sandra as a customer, Fred must deliver the missing red roses before 5 PM. Therefore, Fred must deliver:

\[ 160 - y \]

Since the problem does not specify how many red roses were already delivered, we assume that no red roses were delivered yet. Therefore, Fred needs to deliver all 160 red roses. The number of red roses Fred must deliver is:

To determine Jean's age, we start by finding Marc's age. We know that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. According to the problem, two years ago, Marc was five years older than half of Jan's age at that time. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Marc's age two years ago} = \frac{28}{2} + 5 \]

Calculating the right side of the equation:

\[ \text{Marc's age two years ago} = 14 + 5 = 19 \]

So, two years ago, Marc was 19 years old. Therefore, Marc's current age is:

\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Marc, Jean's current age is:

\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Thus, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old.",23,23

""Two athletic teams compete in a 4 x 400 meters relay race, a race where each team has four members who each run 400 meters, or one lap of a standard track. One of the two teams is very well-coordinated, and each of its members runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less coordinated. Its first runner completes 400 meters in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, in how many seconds will the faster team win the race?""

To answer the question, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the relay race and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the total time for the well-coordinated team:
Each of the four runners runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the well-coordinated team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the less coordinated team:
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs 400 meters in \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds.
The third runner runs 400 meters in \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds.
The fourth runner runs 400 meters in \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds.
Total time for the less coordinated team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is:
\(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win the race in \(\boxed{220}\) seconds.",220,2
mgsm-fr-184,"Translation: Jerry throws a six-sided die. What is the probability (in percentage) that he gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number two times in a row?

To solve this, we need to calculate the probability of two independent events: getting a number greater than 3 and getting an even number, and then use these to find the desired probability.

First, let's determine the probability of each event:
1. The probability of getting a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   \[
   P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]
   Converting this to a percentage:
   \[
   0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

2. The probability of getting an even number on a six-sided die. The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   \[
   P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]
   Converting this to a percentage:
   \[
   0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Next, we need to find the probability that Jerry gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number two times in a row. This means we need to find the probability of getting a number greater than 3 and not getting an even number in each of the two throws.

The probability of getting a number greater than 3 and not getting an even number in a single throw is the probability of getting a 5 or a 6 (since 4 is even and we don't want it). So, there are 2 favorable outcomes (5 and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   \[
   P(\text{number greater than 3 and not even}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
   \]
   Converting this to a percentage:
   \[
   0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33.33\%
   \]

Since the two throws are independent, the probability of this happening two times in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{two times in a row}) = 0.3333 \times 0.3333 \approx 0.1111
   \]
   Converting this to a percentage:
   \[
   0.1111 \times 100 \approx 11.11\%

Therefore, the probability that Jerry gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number two times in a row is \(\boxed{11.11}\).",11,25

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Jenna picked and then add that to the number of apples her mother picked.

1. Identify the number of apples Jenna's mother picked:
   \[
   \text{Mother's apples} = 20

   \]

3. Calculate the total number of apples picked by adding the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother:
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = \text{Mother's apples} + \text{Jenna's apples} = 20 + 10 = 30

No hay is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of hay have been distributed to the small rodents, how many rats are there in each cage?

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of hamsters:**
   Each hamster receives 5 pieces of hay, and there are 10 cages of hamsters.
   \[
   \text{Total hay for hamsters} = 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of hay distributed to the small rodents:**
   The total number of pieces of hay distributed to the small rodents is 160 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of hay distributed to the rabbits:**
   The total number of pieces of hay distributed to the rabbits is 20 pieces.

4. **Calculate the total number of pieces of hay distributed to the rats:**
   \[
   \text{Total hay for rats} = 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces (hamsters)} - 20 \text{ pieces (rabbits)} = 90 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of rats:**
   Each rat receives 6 pieces of hay, and there are 3 cages of rats.
   \[
   \text{Number of rats} = \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats}
   \]

6. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rats per cage} = \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage}

To determine the total amount Mandy must give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over this period and add it to the original debt.

The formula for the total amount after a certain period with compound interest is:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

Since the interest is compounded monthly, \( n = 12 \) and \( t = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25 \) years. The monthly interest rate is 2%, so the annual interest rate \( r = 2 \times 12 = 24\% = 0.24 \).

However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we use the monthly interest rate directly in the formula:
\[ A = 100 \left(1 + 0.02\right)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \left(1.02\right)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy must give to Benedict is:

1. Identify the number of dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. Determine the number of cats. Since there are two cats for each dog:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked and then find out how many tomatoes were used.

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes after cooking:**
   - Freda's last preparation yielded 32 ounces of sauce.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half of their volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   \[
   \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Determine the volume of one can of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.

3. **Determine the number of cans used:**
   - To find the number of cans used, we divide the original volume of the tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}

Knowing that there were initially 30 cars on the highway, how many cars passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes. Let's break it down step by step.

2. Subtract the number of potted plants she will give away.

First, let's find out how many potted plants Marie had before receiving the new ones. She had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window sills. So, the total number of potted plants she had initially is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we add the 18 new potted plants she received:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \]

Now, Marie plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window sills. So, she will give away:
\[ 40 \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants she will have left is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \]

So, the number of potted plants Marie will have left is \(\boxed{58}\).",58,58
mgsm-fr-100,"Translation: One day, 4 friends visited Jerome. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door, the second friend rang 1/4 times more than the first, and the third friend rang 10 times more than the fourth. Given that the fourth friend rang 60 times, how many times in total did the doorbell ring?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each friend rang the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend rang the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend rang the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend rang the doorbell:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Therefore, the total number of times the doorbell rang is \(\boxed{175}\).",175,175

On Monday, he read 15 pages. If he only has 4 days left to finish his reading, how many pages will he need to read on average each day?

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

\[ 4 \text{ (science)} + 20 \text{ (social studies)} + 7 \text{ (history)} + 8 \text{ (geography)} = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we subtract the number of pages he has already read:

\[ 39 \text{ (total pages)} - 15 \text{ (pages read on Monday)} = 24 \text{ pages remaining} \]

Since he has 4 days left to read the remaining pages, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages per day} \]

So, Solo will need to read \(\boxed{6}\) pages each day on average.",6,6

mgsm-fr-103,"Translation: A fog bank arrives from the ocean and gradually covers a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. If the city extends over 42 miles from the ocean's edge to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the entire city?

To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to find the rate at which the fog bank is covering the city. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles. We can do this by dividing the total distance by the rate of coverage:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

So, it will take the fog bank \(\boxed{140}\) minutes to cover the entire city.",140,140
mgsm-fr-104,"Translation: Poppy is trying to solve a 1,000-piece puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mother places a third of the remaining pieces. How many puzzle pieces are still left to place?

To solve the problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board.
2. Calculate the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces.
3. Determine how many pieces Poppy's mother places.
4. Calculate the number of pieces remaining after her mother places her pieces.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1,000 pieces on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

2. Poppy's mother then places a third of the remaining 750 pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy's mother} = \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]
   So, the number of pieces remaining after her mother places her pieces is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500

To find the total number of cookies they eat, we first determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies eaten by Cody} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we add the number of cookies eaten by Cody and Amir to find the total number of cookies eaten by both:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies eaten by Cody} + \text{Cookies eaten by Amir} = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they eat is $\boxed{20}$.",20,20
mgsm-fr-106,"Translation: Jean has 3 boxes. Each box measures 5 x 6 x 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total internal volume of the 3 boxes?

To find the internal volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension of the box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the internal dimensions of each box will be:

- Length: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches (subtracting 1 inch from each end)
- Width: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches (subtracting 1 inch from each end)
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches (subtracting 1 inch from the top and bottom)

So, the internal volume of one box is:
\[4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Since Jean has 3 boxes, the total internal volume of the 3 boxes is:
\[3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Thus, the total internal volume of the 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72

On Wednesday, he watched some half-hour shows. On Thursday, he finished his homework earlier and watched a 1-hour episode and a half-hour show. On Friday, because of the weekend, he stayed up late and watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched a total of 7 hours of television, how many half-hour shows did he watch on Wednesday?

To find out how many half-hour shows Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can calculate the total time spent watching television from Monday to Friday and then determine the time spent on Wednesday.

From Monday to Friday, Frankie watched:
- 2 days * 1 hour = 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday)
- 1 hour (Thursday)
- 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours (Friday)

Total time from Monday, Thursday, and Friday:
2 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total time spent watching television is 7 hours, the time spent watching television on Wednesday is:
7 - 5 = 2 hours

Each half-hour show is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. Therefore, the number of half-hour shows Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
2 hours / 0.5 hours per show = 4 shows

So, Frankie watched $\boxed{4}$ half-hour shows on Wednesday.",4,3

At the end of the batch, he realizes he made 15 more cookies than planned. He accidentally drops 5 of his cookies while they are cooling, and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri make last year?

To find out how many cookies Henri made last year, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henri made last year.
2. This year, Henri wants to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he plans to make \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ends up making 15 more cookies than planned, so he actually makes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100

Unfortunately, due to an error, Béatrice ends up with two wide tarts and 24 long tarts, while Marcell gets three wide tarts and 14 long tarts. If both of them ate all their tarts, what is the average number of tarts each of them ate?

To find the average number of tarts each person ate, we first need to determine the total number of tarts each person ate and then find the average.

Béatrice ate 2 wide tarts and 24 long tarts, so the total number of tarts she ate is:
\[2 + 24 = 26\]

Marcell ate 3 wide tarts and 14 long tarts, so the total number of tarts he ate is:
\[3 + 14 = 17\]

The total number of tarts eaten by both Marcell and Béatrice is:
\[26 + 17 = 43\]

Since there are two people, the average number of tarts each person ate is:
\[\frac{43}{2} = 21.5\]

Thus, the average number of tarts each of them ate is \(\boxed{21.5}\).",5,45
mgsm-fr-111,"Translation: A leak occurred in Julia's boat while she was on the lake. The boat started taking in two liters of water for every ten feet rowed towards the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore is 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken in when Julia reached the shore?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water the boat took in over the 64 seconds it took Julia to reach the shore.

First, we calculate the rate at which the boat takes in water. The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. This means the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the boat rowed in 64 seconds. We know that it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so the rate of rowing is:
\[ \text{Rate of rowing} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance rowed in 64 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance rowed} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Since the boat takes in 0.2 liters of water per foot, the total amount of water taken in is:
\[ \text{Total water taken in} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water the boat had taken in when Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16

To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes given by the 4 teachers in a day.
2. Determine how many times the whiteboard is used in a day.
3. Calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes given by the 4 teachers in a day.
Each teacher gives 2 classes a day, and there are 4 teachers.
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ classes/teacher} = 8 \text{ classes/day} \]

Step 2: Determine how many times the whiteboard is used in a day.
Since the whiteboard is used once per class, the number of times the whiteboard is used is the same as the number of classes.
\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.
The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per class.
\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/class} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to account for the 5 flowers that have not grown. Therefore, the number of flowers that have actually grown is:

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers Ryan will have after 15 days is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25

Brittany's phone can store a maximum of 50 times the number of ducks in the photo taken by Jamal at the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo he took?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took. Let's denote the number of ducks in the photo by \( d \).

According to the problem, Brittany's phone can store 50 times the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took. Therefore, the capacity of Brittany's phone is \( 50d \).

Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. Therefore, the capacity of Jamal's phone is \( 6 \times 50d = 300d \).

We know that Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 300d = 1800 \]

To find \( d \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 300:
\[ d = \frac{1800}{300} = 6 \]

Thus, the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took is \( \boxed{6} \).",6,6
mgsm-fr-115,"Translation: 
A few months after buying building wood, Sasha notices that the prices have increased by 50% in the last few months. She decides to sell the wood she has left. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 planks that originally cost her $10 each, and five 4 x 4 x 10 planks that she bought for $16 each. If she manages to sell all of them, what will her profit be?

Answer:
First, let's calculate the total cost of the wood Sasha originally bought.

- For the 2 x 4 x 10 planks: 
  \[
  10 \text{ planks} \times 10 \text{ dollars per plank} = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- For the 4 x 4 x 10 planks: 
  \[
  5 \text{ planks} \times 16 \text{ dollars per plank} = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the total cost of the wood is:
\[
100 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the new prices after the 50% increase.

- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 planks:
  \[
  10 \text{ dollars} \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars per plank}
  \]

- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 planks:
  \[
  16 \text{ dollars} \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars per plank}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total selling price if she sells all the planks.

- For the 2 x 4 x 10 planks:
  \[
  10 \text{ planks} \times 15 \text{ dollars per plank} = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- For the 4 x 4 x 10 planks:
  \[
  5 \text{ planks} \times 24 \text{ dollars per plank} = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[
150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 270 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price:
\[
270 \text{ dollars} - 180 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Sasha's profit will be \boxed{90}.",90,90

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of sugar and water used and the ratio of sugar to water.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and water used is 120. Since the ratio tells us that 7 parts out of 20 are sugar, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120 = 7 \times 6 = 42

2. Multiply the cost for one child by the number of children.

First, let's calculate the cost of shoes for one child. Jean buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, and each pair costs 60$. So, the cost for one child is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost for all 3 children. Since each child's shoes cost 120 dollars, the total cost for 3 children is:

To solve this problem, we start by determining the total number of vehicles already in the port from the first day. The customs agent counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles in the port increased to 30. This means that the number of new vehicles that arrived on the second day is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of new containers that arrived on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4

If Adrian and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrian was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.

To solve this problem, we need to find the initial salary of Lylah and then determine their salaries four years later.

1. Let \( L \) be Lylah's initial salary.
2. Adrian's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so Adrian's initial salary was \( 1.3L \).
3. We know Adrian's initial salary was $40,000, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.3L = 40000
   \]
4. Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]
5. Four years later, Adrian's salary was 40% higher than his initial salary, so his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]
6. Four years later, Lylah's salary was also 40% higher than her initial salary, so her new salary is:
   \[
   \frac{40000}{1.3} \times 1.4 = \frac{40000 \times 1.4}{1.3} = \frac{56000}{1.3} \approx 43076.92

7. The total amount of their two salaries four years later is:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

To find the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael, we need to calculate the number of fruits each brought and then sum them up.

First, let's determine how many fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each brought:
- Morisette brought \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits.
- Kael brought \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits.

Adding the fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael, we get:

To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total during the whole week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Determine how many hours Sadie slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
   - On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than on Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.

2. Calculate how many hours Sadie slept on the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).
   - On each of these days, she slept 1 hour more than on Wednesday, so she slept \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours each day.
   - Therefore, for the four days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

3. Add up the hours slept from Monday to Sunday.
   - On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
   - On Tuesday, she slept 6 hours.
   - On Wednesday, she slept 4 hours.
   - On Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she slept 20 hours.

mgsm-fr-124,"Translation: Jennie helps her mother's office. She has a pile of 60 letters to stamp and another pile with already stamped letters. She stamps a third of the letters to be stamped. Now there are 30 letters in the pile of stamped letters. How many were in this pile when Jennie started the work?

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jennie starts with 60 letters to stamp.
2. She stamps a third of these letters. So, she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.
3. After stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of stamped letters is 30. This means that the 30 letters in the pile include the 20 letters she just stamped plus the letters that were already stamped before she started.

Let \( x \) be the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started. Then we have:
\[ x + 20 = 30 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of stamped letters when Jennie started the work. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]",10,10
mgsm-fr-125,"Translation: Julia was preparing for a dinner at her place where she planned to serve stew. She noticed she didn't have any plastic spoons and so she bought a new pack of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a pack of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. While cooking, Julia used three spoons to taste her stew. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the pack that Julia bought?

To find out how many spoons were in the pack that Julia bought, we can set up the following equation based on the information provided:

Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the pack that Julia bought. According to the problem, Julia's husband gave her 5 more spoons, and she used 3 spoons to taste the stew. After these actions, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, the equation is:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the pack that Julia bought is \( \boxed{10} \).",10,10

Answer: First, we need to determine how many questions Marc answered in each test based on the time he spent and his rate of answering questions.

For the first test:
- Marc's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He took 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he answered is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

Since the test had 75 questions and he only answered 40, the number of questions he did not answer is \(75 - 40 = 35\).

For the second test:
- Marc's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He took 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he answered is \(5 \times 6 = 30\).

Since the test had 100 questions and he only answered 30, the number of questions he did not answer is \(100 - 30 = 70\).

Adding the number of questions he did not answer from both tests, we get \(35 + 70 = 105\).

To solve this, let's denote the number of pink candies as \( p \). According to the problem, the number of blue candies is 22 times four times the number of pink candies. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of blue candies} = 22 \times 4 \times p \]

We know that the number of blue candies is 12. So we can set up the equation:

\[ 12 = 22 \times 4 \times p \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 12 = 88p \]

To find \( p \), we need to solve for \( p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 88:

polymath-low-fr-33,"Translation: Gretchen has 110 pieces. The gold pieces are 30 more than the silver pieces. How many gold pieces does Gretchen have?

To find out how many gold pieces Gretchen has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of silver pieces as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of gold pieces is \( S + 30 \). The total number of pieces is the sum of the gold and silver pieces, which is 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( S \). We do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver pieces. Since the number of gold pieces is 30 more than the number of silver pieces, we calculate the number of gold pieces as follows:

\[ S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold pieces.",70,70

To find out how many pieces of jewelry Siobhan has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pieces of jewelry Aaron has.
2. Use the number of pieces Aaron has to find out how many pieces Siobhan has.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 pieces of jewelry. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more pieces than half of Raymond's pieces. So, we calculate half of Raymond's pieces:
\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]
Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many pieces Aaron has:
\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]
So, Aaron has 25 pieces of jewelry.

Next, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer pieces than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of pieces Aaron has:

To find out how much money Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we first need to determine the cost of the yogurts he consumes daily and then extend that to 30 days.

1. Calculate the daily cost of Terry's yogurts:
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - The price is 5 yogurts for 5.00 dollars.
   - Therefore, the cost of 2 yogurts is \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

2. Calculate the total cost over 30 days:
   - Since Terry spends 2.00 dollars per day, over 30 days he will spend \(2.00 \times 30 = 60.00\) dollars.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Lego sets Jean sold and how many he has left after buying the video games.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jean received from selling the Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/set} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/game} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, Jean has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 he has left equals the money he got from selling the Lego sets:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jean received $195 from selling the Lego sets, the amount of money he spent on the video games and had left is $165. This means he spent:
\[ 195 \text{ dollars} - 165 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
on the Lego sets he did not sell. Therefore, the number of Lego sets he did not sell is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ dollars}}{15 \text{ dollars/set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

So, the number of Lego sets Jean has left is:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} - 2 \text{ sets} = 11 \text{ sets} \]

polymath-low-fr-38,"Translation: Jean runs 60 miles each week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and runs half as much on the other two days. What is his running speed?

To find Jean's running speed, we need to determine the distance he runs each day and then calculate his speed based on the total distance and the total time he runs.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   Jean runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as on the first day. So, the distance he runs on each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]
   Since he runs on two such days, the total distance for these two days is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance on the other two days} = 2 \times \frac{3v}{2} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total weekly distance:**
   The total distance Jean runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on all three days:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly distance} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]
   We know that the total weekly distance is 60 miles, so:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}

To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the age of Ben's iPhone. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzie's, and Suzie's iPhone is 1 year old, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}

polymath-low-fr-41,"Translation: Perg, the great dragon, was sitting at the top of Mount Farbo and spitting fire over a distance of 1,000 feet. Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but only over a distance of 400 feet, which was well within the dragon's flame range. However, when Polly held the sapphire gem, she could throw it three times further. With the precious stone, how far could Polly stay out of the dragon's flame range while still being able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin?

Answer: To determine the distance Polly could stay out of the dragon's flame range while still being able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin, we need to consider the range of her throw with the sapphire gem. Since Polly can throw the javelin three times further with the sapphire gem, we calculate the new range as follows:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Since the dragon's flame range is 1,000 feet, Polly can stay any distance greater than 1,000 feet but less than or equal to 1,200 feet and still be able to hit the dragon. The maximum distance she can stay out of the dragon's flame range while still being able to hit the dragon is 1,200 feet.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{1200}\).",1200,200

She then cut each pie into 8 slices and placed the five pies on the buffet table for everyone to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after all the guests had taken and eaten their slices, there were 14 slices left. How many slices did the guests take?

To determine how many slices the guests took, we first calculate the total number of slices available initially. Since there were 5 pies and each pie was cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 slices left. Therefore, the number of slices taken by the guests is the total number of slices minus the number of slices left:
\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

So, the guests took \(\boxed{26}\) slices.",26,26

If a 300g bag contains 5 servings, how many grams of chips will you eat, knowing that your daily caloric goal is 2000 calories and that you have already consumed 1800 calories?

To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of calories remaining for the day.
2. Determine how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the number of servings into grams of chips.

First, calculate the remaining calories:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, determine how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories, you can consume:
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each bag contains 5 servings and is 300 grams, each serving is:
\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, 0.8 servings would be:
\[ 0.8 \times 60 = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat \(\boxed{48}\) grams of chips.",48,48

If he produces and sells 20 candles, what is his net profit, knowing that each candle is sold for $2.00?

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of producing 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue.**

Each candle is sold for $2.00, and Charlie sells 20 candles.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.00, and Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax to produce 10 candles. Therefore, to produce 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00

Thus, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
polymath-low-fr-45,"Translation: Mérédith is a freelance blogger whose job involves writing articles on health topics and submitting them to clients every day. On average, it takes 4 hours to write a blog post, which includes research and writing. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over these three days.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of articles Mérédith wrote each day and then calculate the total time spent writing.

1. **Monday:**
   - Mérédith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday: \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday: \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total time spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

polymath-low-fr-46,"Translation: Before going to work at the café, Candice put 80 sticky notes in her handbag. On the way, she stopped to buy a pack of sticky notes at the store. Upon arriving at work, she placed a sticky note on each of the 220 coffee mugs. If she had only 23 sticky notes left afterward, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?

To find out how many sticky notes were in the pack Candice bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of sticky notes Candice had before she placed any on the coffee mugs.
2. Subtract the number of sticky notes she used from the total number of sticky notes she had before.
3. The result will be the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought.

Let's start with the initial number of sticky notes Candice had:
\[ 80 \text{ (initial sticky notes)} \]

Next, we know she placed a sticky note on each of the 220 coffee mugs, so she used 220 sticky notes:
\[ 80 - 220 = -140 \]

Since she ended up with 23 sticky notes left, we need to account for the sticky notes she bought. Let \( x \) be the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought. The equation representing the situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163
polymath-low-fr-47,"Translation: Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on the blue ties which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total?

To solve this, we first need to determine the number of blue ties Jean bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on them, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800

To find the total number of unoccupied apartments, we first need to determine the total number of apartments in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments, the total number of apartments is:

\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many apartments are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied apartments is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

The number of unoccupied apartments is the total number of apartments minus the number of occupied apartments:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total weight reduction from removing 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, so removing 30 comic books will reduce the weight by:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be reduced to reach the total reduction of 15 pounds. This is calculated as:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to reduce the weight by 7.5 pounds is:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

On Thursday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, he repaired 12 car tires and none of the truck tires. On which day were the earnings the highest, and how much more money did the mechanic earn on that day?

Answer: To determine which day the mechanic earned the most, we need to calculate the earnings for each day.

For Thursday:
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total earnings on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

For Friday:
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60/tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total earnings on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Comparing the earnings:
- Thursday: $520
- Friday: $480

The earnings were highest on Thursday. The difference in earnings between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

To find the average area of a level, we first need to determine the area of each level. We know the highest level (the 4th level) has an area of 16 square feet. Since each level has half the area of the level below it, we can calculate the areas of the other levels as follows:

- The 4th level: 16 square feet
- The 3rd level: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet
- The 2nd level: \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet
- The 1st level: \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet

Now, we can find the total area of the sandcastle by summing the areas of all four levels:
\[
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average area of a level, we divide the total area by the number of levels:

polymath-low-fr-84,"Translation: A football team played 22 matches. They won _ times more than they lost. How many times did they win?

Let's denote the number of matches the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of matches the team won is \( L + L \times 1 = 2L \). The total number of matches played is the sum of the matches won and lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + 2L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3L = 22 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ L = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]

Since the number of matches lost must be a whole number, and the problem implies an exact solution, we recognize that \( L \) must be an integer. However, the problem setup and the integer nature of matches suggest a re-evaluation of the interpretation, but the arithmetic is correct under the given constraints. The number of wins is then:

\[ 2L = 2 \times \frac{22}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67 \]

Given the problem's context and the need for an integer solution, we can infer the closest integer fit, but the exact problem setup implies:

If Sylvie just completed 5 years at the company last December, what will her annual salary be after three more years of service?

To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sylvie's initial monthly salary after five years of service.
2. Calculate her monthly salary after an additional three years of service.
3. Determine her annual salary based on the final monthly salary.

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's initial monthly salary after five years of service.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After five years of service, her salary is increased by 10%. Therefore, her new monthly salary is:
\[ 600 + 0.10 \times 600 = 600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her monthly salary after an additional three years of service.**

Since Sylvie has already completed five years of service, she will continue to receive the increased salary of $660 per month for the next three years. Therefore, her monthly salary after three more years of service remains $660.

**Step 3: Determine her annual salary based on the final monthly salary.**

polymath-low-fr-90,"Question in English: Ted the tyrannosaur has planned to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic. He knows that he will need 10 pounds of salad for an adult dinosaur and half of that quantity for a child. If there are 20 adults and 5 children present at the picnic, how many kilos of potato salad will Ted need to bring in order to hope to feed everyone?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both adults and children and then convert the total from pounds to kilos.

First, calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult needs 10 pounds of salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- Therefore, the total amount of salad for adults is \( 10 \text{ pounds/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child needs half of the amount needed for an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
- There are 5 children.
- Therefore, the total amount of salad for children is \( 5 \text{ pounds/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ pounds} \).

Now, add the amounts of salad needed for adults and children to get the total amount of salad required:
- Total salad = \( 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, convert the total amount of salad from pounds to kilos. Since 1 pound is approximately 0.453592 kilograms, we have:

To solve this problem, we will first determine the number of pets each person has and then sum them up.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets}
   \]
3. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has:
   \[
   3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets}

polymath-low-fr-92,"Translation: Emilie has 4 children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and Jacques. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If Jacques is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?

To find the age of Jackson, we need to determine the ages of all the children step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of Jackson as \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
3. Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
4. Jacques is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).
5. Now we can set up the equation for Corey's age: \( J + 7 = 11 \).
6. Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 11 - 7 = 4 \).

So, Jackson is \( \boxed{4} \) years old.",4,4
polymath-low-fr-93,"Translation: Previously, Lee ran the 400 meters hurdles two seconds faster than Gérald. But after changing his diet, Gérald improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds, what is Gérald's running time after his new diet in seconds?

To find Gérald's new running time, we first need to determine his original running time. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gérald, Gérald's original time was:

\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gérald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his new time is 90% of his original time. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gérald's new running time is:

polymath-low-fr-94,"Translation: In a certain neighborhood, the number of pet rabbits is twelve less than the total number of pet dogs and cats. If for each dog there are two cats, and there are 60 dogs in total, how many domestic animals are there in the neighborhood altogether?

To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.

1. Let \( D \) be the number of dogs.
2. Let \( C \) be the number of cats.
3. Let \( R \) be the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
- \( D = 60 \)
- For each dog, there are two cats, so \( C = 2D \).
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the total number of dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, we calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the number of rabbits:
\[ R = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, we find the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of animals} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Thus, the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\).",348,348

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys.
2. Determine the number of girls.
3. Determine the number of girls who are members of the scouts.
4. Determine the number of girls who are not members of the scouts.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boys.**

The number of boys is given by:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of girls.**

The number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of girls who are members of the scouts.**

The number of girls who are members of the scouts is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of girls who are not members of the scouts.**

The number of girls who are not members of the scouts is:

To find out how many more hours Harry slept compared to Jacques, we first need to determine how long Jacques slept. Since Jacques slept 2/3 of the time Harry slept, we calculate:

\[ \text{Jacques' sleep time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find the difference in the amount of sleep between Harry and Jacques:

\[ \text{Difference in sleep time} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than Jacques. The final answer is:

polymath-low-fr-97,"Translation: When Freda cooks tomatoes for sauce, they lose half of their volume. She uses 16-ounce cans that each contain three tomatoes. Freda's last tomato sauce preparation resulted in 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?

To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the volume of the sauce after cooking is 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes lose half of their volume during cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes before cooking. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes and the volume of each can is 16 ounces, the volume of tomatoes per can before cooking is:
\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 32 \text{ ounces} \]
So, each can contains 32 ounces of tomatoes before cooking. To find out how many cans (and thus how many tomatoes) were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide 64 ounces by 32 ounces per can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{32 \text{ ounces per can}} = 2 \text{ cans} \]
Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 2 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 6 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,12
polymath-low-fr-98,"Translation: Some cars are stuck in a traffic jam on the highway. During the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, some cars manage to move forward, and then 20 more cars during the last 15 minutes. 5 cars leave the queue and do not have to go through the traffic jam. Knowing that there were initially 30 cars on the highway, how many cars passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes?

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There are initially 30 cars on the highway.
2. **Cars that leave the queue**: 5 cars leave the queue and do not have to go through the traffic jam.
3. **Cars that remain in the queue**: After 5 cars leave, the number of cars remaining in the queue is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
4. **Cars that move forward during the last 15 minutes**: During the last 15 minutes, 20 cars manage to move forward. This means that 20 cars have passed through the traffic jam during the last 15 minutes.
5. **Cars that passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes**: Since 25 cars remained in the queue and 20 of them passed through the traffic jam during the last 15 minutes, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes is \(25 - 20 = 5\).

Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5
polymath-low-fr-99,"Translation: Marie loves gardening. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window sills in her large country house. She has decided that tomorrow, she will take 1 potted plant from each window sill to generously give to friends and acquaintances. How many potted plants will Marie have left?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Marie had initially.
2. Subtract the number of potted plants she will give away.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Marie had initially:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/rebord} \times 40 \text{ rebords} = 80 \text{ plants} \]
Adding the 18 new potted plants she received:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. Since she will take 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window sills:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/rebord} \times 40 \text{ rebords} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she had initially:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Marie will have left is \(\boxed{58}\).",58,58

The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door, the second friend rang 1/4 times more than the first, and the third friend rang 10 times more than the fourth. Given that the fourth friend rang 60 times, how many times in total did the doorbell ring?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each friend rang the doorbell and then sum these numbers.

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend rang the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend rang the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend rang the doorbell:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of times the doorbell rang is \(\boxed{175}\).",175,175

On Monday, he read 15 pages. If he only has 4 days left to finish his reading, how many pages will he need to read on average each day?

To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average each day, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he needs to read. This is the sum of the pages from each manual:

\[ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \]

Next, we subtract the number of pages he has already read from the total number of pages:

\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pages he needs to read each day over the next 4 days. We do this by dividing the remaining number of pages by the number of days left:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the fog bank is covering the city and then use that rate to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles.

First, we calculate the rate at which the fog bank is covering the city. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate is:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}

\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}} = 140 \text{ minutes}

To solve this, we start by determining how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces:

\[ \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

This means that the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, her mother places a third of the remaining pieces:

\[ \text{Pieces placed by Poppy's mother} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

So, the number of pieces remaining after her mother places her pieces is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Next, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats to find the total number of cookies they eat together. This is \(5 + 15 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of cookies they eat is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
polymath-low-fr-106,"Translation: Jean has 3 boxes. Each box measures 5 x 6 x 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total internal volume of the 3 boxes?

To find the internal volume of one box, we first need to determine the internal dimensions. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the internal dimensions will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The original dimensions of each box are 5 x 6 x 4 inches. The internal dimensions will be:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

The internal volume of one box is calculated as:

On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished his homework earlier and watched one 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, because of the weekend, he stayed up late and watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched a total of 7 hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time he spent watching television from Monday to Friday and then subtract the time spent on the other days.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour (1-hour episode) + 0.5 hours (30-minute show)
- Friday: 2 hours (2 one-hour episodes)

Total time from Monday to Friday: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the time spent from Monday to Thursday:
- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday = 1 + 1 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours

So, the time spent on Friday is:
- 7 - 3.5 = 3.5 hours

Since Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes on Friday, the remaining time must be from the 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. The time spent on Friday is 3.5 hours, and since he watched two 1-hour episodes, the remaining time is:
- 3.5 - 2 = 1.5 hours

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
- 1.5 / 0.5 = 3

So, Frankie watched $\boxed{3}$ 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.",30,3

At the end of the baking, he realizes he made 15 more cookies than planned. He drops 5 of his cookies while they are cooling and ends up with a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henri make last year?

To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henri made last year.
2. This year, Henri wants to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he plans to make \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ends up making 15 more cookies than planned, so he actually makes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110

6. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100

If both of them ate all their tarts, how many did they eat on average?""

To find the average number of tarts eaten by Marcell and Béatrice, we first need to determine the total number of tarts each of them ate.

Béatrice ate 2 wide tarts and 24 long tarts, so the total number of tarts she ate is:
\[2 + 24 = 26\]

Marcell ate 3 wide tarts and 14 long tarts, so the total number of tarts he ate is:
\[3 + 14 = 17\]

Next, we find the total number of tarts eaten by both Marcell and Béatrice:
\[26 + 17 = 43\]

It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore being 64 seconds away, how much water had the boat taken in when Julia reached the shore?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water the boat took in by the time Julia reached the shore. We know the following:

1. The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
2. It takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
3. The shore is 64 seconds away.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore. Now, we need to calculate how much water the boat takes in for 80 feet. Since the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can set up another proportion:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}

1. Calculate the total number of classes given by the teachers in a day.
2. Determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per class.
3. Multiply the total number of classes by the number of cleanings per class.

First, we calculate the total number of classes given by the teachers in a day. Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher gives 2 classes per day, the total number of classes is:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ classes/teacher} = 8 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we know that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per class. Therefore, the total number of cleanings in a day is:

\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

However, we know that 5 of these flowers have not grown. Therefore, the number of flowers that have actually grown is:

Brittany's phone can store a maximum of 50 times the number of birds in the photo taken by Jamal, which shows ducks in the zoo. If Jamal's phone has a capacity of 1,800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo he took?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in the photo taken by Jamal. Let's denote the number of ducks in the photo by \( d \).

According to the problem, Brittany's phone can store 50 times the number of ducks in the photo. So, the capacity of Brittany's phone is \( 50d \).

Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. Therefore, the capacity of Jamal's phone is \( 6 \times 50d = 300d \).

We know that the capacity of Jamal's phone is 1,800 photos. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 300d = 1800 \]

To find \( d \), we divide both sides of the equation by 300:

A few months after buying construction wood, Sasha notices that the prices have increased by 50% recently. She decides to sell the wood she has left. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 planks, which originally cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 planks, which she bought for $16 each. If she manages to sell all of them, what will her profit be?

Answer:
First, we calculate the total cost of the wood Sasha originally bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 planks:
\[ 10 \text{ planks} \times \$10/\text{plank} = \$100 \]

For the 4 x 4 x 10 planks:
\[ 5 \text{ planks} \times \$16/\text{plank} = \$80 \]

So, the total cost of the wood is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Next, we calculate the total selling price if she sells all the planks at the new prices, which are 50% higher.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 planks:
\[ 10 \text{ planks} \times (\$10 \times 1.5) = 10 \times \$15 = \$150 \]

For the 4 x 4 x 10 planks:
\[ 5 \text{ planks} \times (\$16 \times 1.5) = 5 \times \$24 = \$120 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \$150 + \$120 = \$270 \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price:

polymath-low-fr-116,"Translation: Calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar that Katy poured, given that she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 7:13.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar were used, given the total number of teaspoons of sugar and water used and the ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of teaspoons of water as \(13x\). The total number of teaspoons used is the sum of the teaspoons of sugar and water, which is given as 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 13x = 120\]
\[20x = 120\]
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by substituting \(x = 6\) into the expression for the teaspoons of sugar:
\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

So, the number of teaspoons of sugar that Katy poured is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42
polymath-low-fr-117,"Translation: For each of his 3 children, Jean buys 2 pairs of shoes that cost 60$ each. How much did he pay in total?

To find out how much Jean paid in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of shoes for one child.
2. Multiply the cost of shoes for one child by the number of children.

First, let's calculate the cost of shoes for one child. Jean buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, and each pair costs 60$. So, the cost for one child is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars per pair} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost for all 3 children. Since each child's shoes cost 120 dollars, the total cost for 3 children is:
\[ 3 \text{ children} \times 120 \text{ dollars per child} = 360 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Jean paid is \(\boxed{360}\).",360,360

The next day, new containers arrived, bringing the total number of vehicles in the port to 30. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day, assuming that all containers contain 5 vehicles.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the number of vehicles already in the port before the new containers arrived.
   - The customs agent counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the number of vehicles already in the port is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

2. Determine the number of new vehicles that arrived with the new containers.
   - The total number of vehicles in the port after the new containers arrived is 30.
   - Therefore, the number of new vehicles that arrived is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

3. Determine the number of new containers that arrived.
   - Each new container contains 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the number of new containers that arrived is \(\frac{20}{5} = 4\).

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
polymath-low-fr-119,"Translate the question into English:
Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased and was 40% higher than it was initially. If Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\boxed{}$:

First, we need to determine Adrien's current salary. Adrien's initial salary was $40,000. Four years later, his salary is 40% higher than it was initially. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Adrien's current salary} = 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

Next, we need to determine Lylah's initial salary. Since Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's initial salary as:

\[ \text{Lylah's initial salary} = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary is 40% higher than it was initially. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Lylah's current salary} = 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43,076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries to find the total amount of their two salaries four years later:

\[ \text{Total current salaries} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Thus, the total amount of their two salaries four years later is $\boxed{99076.92}$.",92,95200

polymath-low-fr-121,"Translation: It was asked of Morisette and Kael to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice as many apples and half as many oranges as Morisette. How many fruits did they bring in total?

To find the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael, we need to calculate the number of fruits each brought and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each brought:
- Morisette brought \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits.
- Kael brought \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits.

Adding the fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael, we get:

To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept during the week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the hours slept on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
   - On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday: \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday: \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.

2. **Calculate the hours slept on the rest of the week:**
   - For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept a total of \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours.
   - Therefore, for the rest of the week, she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours per day.
   - Since there are 4 days in the rest of the week, the total hours for these days is \(11 \times 4 = 44\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours slept during the week:**
   - Add the hours slept on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and the rest of the week.
   - Total hours = \(8 + 6 + 4 + 44 = 62\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept during the whole week is \(\boxed{62}\).",62,48
polymath-low-fr-123,"Translation: Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. Then, she runs at 5 miles per hour. How many miles will she have run in 7 hours?

To find out how many miles Rosie will have run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. Since she runs for a total of 7 hours and 3 of those hours are at 10 miles per hour, the remaining time is:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, add the two distances together to find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

She stamps a third of the letters to be stamped. Now there are 30 letters in the stack of stamped letters. How many were in this stack when Jennie started the job?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started her work. Let's denote the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started as \( x \).

Initially, Jennie has a total of 60 letters to stamp. After stamping a third of these letters, the number of letters that have been stamped is 30. This means that the number of letters she stamped is:
\[
\frac{60}{3} = 20
\]
So, the total number of letters that are now in the stack of stamped letters is the sum of the letters she stamped and the letters that were already stamped:
\[
x + 20 = 30
\]
To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10

To determine how many pizzas Jean should order, we first calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. Since there are 20 friends and each friend gets 4 slices, the total number of slices required is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to get 80 slices, given that each pizza is cut into 8 slices. We do this by dividing the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many new pens can be made from the 25 pens Ram initially buys.
2. Calculate the total number of pens Ram will have after making the new pens.

Initially, Ram has 25 pens. When each pen is empty, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. Therefore, from the 25 pens, he can make:

\[
\frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
\]

After making these 5 new pens, the total number of pens Ram will have is the sum of the original 25 pens and the 5 new pens:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candies Robert has and then use that information to find out how many candies Jacques has. Finally, we will calculate the difference between the number of candies Jean and Jacques have.

1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, Jean has twice as many candies as Robert, so Jean has \( 2R \) candies. We know that Jean has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27

To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person reads. Dolly has 2 books and Pandore has 1 book. If they read each other's books, Dolly will read Pandore's book and Pandore will read Dolly's book. So, Dolly will read 2 (her own books) + 1 (Pandore's book) = 3 books. Similarly, Pandore will read 1 (her own book) + 2 (Dolly's books) = 3 books. Therefore, the total number of books read by both of them is 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandore's total) = 6 books.

To determine how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives each week.
2. Determine the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response.
3. Calculate the total time Mike spends writing in minutes.
4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives each week.**

Mike was corresponding with 5 people and stopped corresponding with 2 of them. Therefore, he is still corresponding with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people. Each of these 3 people sends him 2 letters per week. So, the total number of letters Mike receives each week is:
\[3 \times 2 = 6\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response.**

Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike receives 6 letters per week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike needs to write is:
\[6 \times 5 = 30\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time Mike spends writing in minutes.**

Mike can write one page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of cookies each person ate and then convert that into calories.

First, let's determine how many cookies Sue ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each person ate over the two days:
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Now, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since each cookie contains 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

To find the total number of rolls needed, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required. According to the problem, a dress requires 2 rolls of blue fiber and half of this amount in white fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber required is:

\[
\frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ roll}
\]

Next, we add the rolls of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of rolls needed:

\[
2 + 1 = 3

Thus, the total number of rolls needed is \(\boxed{3}\).",3,3
polymath-low-fr-2,"Translation: Josh is renovating a house. He buys it for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in its restoration. The value of the house then increases by 150%. What profit has he made?

To determine the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the 150% increase.
2. Subtract the total investment from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original value of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase means the value increases by 1.5 times the original value. Therefore, the increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]
So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we subtract the total investment from the new value of the house to find the profit. The total investment is the sum of the purchase price and the restoration cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]
The profit is:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh has realized is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

polymath-low-fr-4,"Translation: To keep her chickens healthy, Wendi gives them three meals a day of a mixture of seeds, flour worms, and vegetables, which total three bowls per meal. In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls, and in the afternoon, she gives them 25 bowls. If her flock consists of 20 chickens, how many bowls of food should she give them for their last meal of the day?

To solve this, we need to determine the number of bowls of food Wendi gives to the chickens for their last meal of the day. We know that each chicken gets 3 bowls of food per day, and Wendi has 20 chickens. We also know that she has already given them 15 bowls in the morning and 25 bowls in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of bowls given in the day so far is:

\[15 + 25 = 40\]

Since each chicken gets 3 bowls of food per day, the total number of bowls needed for 20 chickens is:

\[20 \times 3 = 60\]

Since 40 bowls have already been given, the number of bowls left to be given for the last meal is:

\[60 - 40 = 20\]

Thus, Wendi should give the chickens \(\boxed{20}\) bowls of food for their last meal of the day.",20,20
polymath-low-fr-5,"Translation: Kylar goes to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. A glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay for them?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses where every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

First, let's determine the cost of the glasses in pairs:
- The cost of one glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass in a pair is 60% of $5, which is $5 \times 0.60 = $3.

So, the cost of each pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he will buy:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 8 pairs of glasses:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times 8 \text{ dollars per pair} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar will have to pay is:

To find the total number of sheep, we start by determining the number of sheep each city has based on the given information.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is:
   \[
   4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is:
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total:
\[
160 + 80 + 20 = 260

However, at 40% of the download, Windows requires a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file?

To solve this, we first calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:

- 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80 \, \text{GB}\).
- At a speed of 2 GB per minute, it takes \( \frac{80 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/minute}} = 40 \, \text{minutes} \) to download 80 GB.

After downloading 80 GB, Carla has to restart her computer, which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, she has to start the download from the beginning, so she needs to download the full 200 GB again.

The time to download the full 200 GB is:

- \( \frac{200 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/minute}} = 100 \, \text{minutes} \).

Adding the time for the restart and the initial 40 minutes of download, the total time is:

- \(40 \, \text{minutes} + 20 \, \text{minutes} + 100 \, \text{minutes} = 160 \, \text{minutes}\).

polymath-low-fr-8,"Question in English: Jean drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns back after realizing he forgot something very important at home. He tries to get back in 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in traffic jams. For the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph for the rest of the 4 hours. What distance is he from his home at the end of the 4 hours?

To determine the distance Jean is from his home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in both directions and then find the net distance from his starting point.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Jean spends 2 hours in traffic jams, so he has 2 hours left to drive.
   - For the first half hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.
   - Total distance driven on the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

3. **Net Distance:**
   - Distance from home = Distance outbound - Distance return = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of the 4 hours, Jean is $\boxed{45}$ miles from his home.",45,45

It then decreased by 30% in the third month. How many times in total was the program downloaded over these three months?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads decreased by 30% from the second month. First, we calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this from the second month's total:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126

4. **Total Downloads:**
   We sum the downloads from all three months:
   \[

polymath-low-fr-12,"Translation: Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree. The planting cost is 90$. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons which will be sold at a price of 1.5$ each. The watering and nutrition cost for the tree is 3$ per year. How many years will it take Carlos to start making a profit with his lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find out when the total net profit will be positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
\[ \text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.5 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 3 \text{ dollars/year} \]

The net profit each year is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = 10.5 \text{ dollars/year} - 3 \text{ dollars/year} = 7.5 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial planting cost of 90 dollars. Let \( n \) be the number of years. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Total net profit after } n \text{ years} = 7.5n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the total net profit is at least 90 dollars:
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making a profit with his lemon tree. The answer is:

Finally, she sold half of what was left to the Orange House. If Mélanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she have at the beginning?

To find out how many vacuum cleaners Mélanie had at the beginning, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. After selling half of the remaining vacuum cleaners to the Orange House, Mélanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means before selling to the Orange House, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners.
2. Before selling 2 vacuum cleaners to the Red House, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first calculate the number of students in each of the other dance styles.

For contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

For jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{25}{100} \times 20 = 5 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of students in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:
\[ 20 - 4 - 5 = 11 \text{ students} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of students in hip-hop dance:

If the merchant chooses the option that maximizes his profit at the end of the month, what would be the amount of this profit?""

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in \boxed{}:
To determine which option maximizes the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the profit from each option after the market increase.

1. **Jewelry Option:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - New value: $5,000 \times (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 \times 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Option:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - New value: $8,000 \times (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 \times 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the two profits, the jewelry option yields a higher profit of $125 compared to the electronic gadgets option, which yields a profit of $96.

Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize his profit, and the amount of this profit is \boxed{125}.",125,125

First, let's calculate her earnings from being a teacher:
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20.

So, her annual earnings from being a teacher are:
\[ 35 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} \times 20 \, \text{\$/hour} = 35000 \, \text{\$} \]

polymath-low-fr-19,"Translation: Marissa is hiking on a trail that is 12 miles long. She took 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles, and another hour for the next 2 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to maintain for the remaining distance?

To find the speed Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance, we first calculate the total time she has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance is 12 miles, and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour. The total time required to hike 12 miles at 4 miles per hour is:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours on the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to cover the remaining 6 miles is:
\[
\text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles, we use the formula for speed:
\[
\text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

Thus, Marissa needs to maintain a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour for the remaining distance.",6,6
polymath-low-fr-20,"Translation: I have 10 liters of orange juice that is two-thirds water. Wanting to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-quarters water, I accidentally spill one liter of orange juice. How much water is there in the remaining 24 liters?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the orange juice and pineapple juice before and after the spill, and then find the total amount of water in the remaining mixture.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the original orange juice:**
   The orange juice is two-thirds water. Therefore, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange juice is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
   \]
   The amount of orange juice that is not water (i.e., the pure orange juice) is:
   \[
   10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the original pineapple juice:**
   The pineapple juice is three-quarters water. Therefore, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple juice is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25 \text{ liters}
   \]
   The amount of pineapple juice that is not water (i.e., the pure pineapple juice) is:
   \[
   15 - \frac{45}{4} = \frac{60}{4} - \frac{45}{4} = \frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water and orange juice after the spill:**
   When 1 liter of orange juice is spilled, the amount of water in the spilled juice is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \text{ liters}
   \]
   The amount of pure orange juice in the spilled juice is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33 \text{ liters}
   \]
   After the spill, the remaining orange juice is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
   \]
   The amount of water in the remaining orange juice is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
   \]
   The amount of pure orange juice in the remaining orange juice is:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining mixture:**
   The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is the sum of the water in the remaining orange juice, the water in the remaining pure orange juice that was spilled, and the water in the pineapple juice:
   \[
   6 + \frac{2}{3} + 11.25 = 6 + 0.67 + 11.25 = 17.92 \approx 17.92 \text{ liters}

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first calculate the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and apples.

The cost of the chicken dish is $12.
The cost of 5 cartons of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the amount spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

If each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\).",2,2
polymath-low-fr-26,"Translation: Mishka bought 3 shorts, 3 pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. A pair of shorts costs $16.50, a pair of pants $22.50, and a pair of shoes $42. How much money did Mishka spend in total on buying these clothes?

To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the shorts, the pants, and the shoes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the shorts:
\[ 3 \text{ shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per short} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pants:
\[ 3 \text{ pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pant} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the shoes:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the shorts, the pants, and the shoes:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mishka spent is \(\boxed{243}\).",243,243
polymath-low-fr-27,"Translation: Cynthia eats a portion of ice cream every night. She buys cartons containing 15 portions of ice cream each, at a price of $4.00 per carton. After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?

To answer this question, we need to determine how many cartons Cynthia will need to buy and then calculate the total cost.

1. Calculate the total number of portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
   \[
   \text{Total portions} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ portion/day} = 60 \text{ portions}
   \]

2. Determine how many cartons are needed. Each carton contains 15 portions:
   \[
   \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ portions}}{15 \text{ portions/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 cartons at $4.00 per carton:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16.00}\) dollars on ice cream after 60 days.",60,16
polymath-low-fr-28,"Translation: Henri made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He marked his first stop after 20 miles. He stopped again 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he ride between the two stops?

To find the distance Henri rode between the two stops, we need to determine the positions of the two stops and then calculate the distance between them.

1. The first stop was after 20 miles.
2. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, the second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop at 20 miles and the second stop at 45 miles. This distance is calculated as follows:
\[45 - 20 = 25\]

Therefore, the distance Henri rode between the two stops is \(\boxed{25}\) miles.",25,25
polymath-low-fr-29,"Translation: While she is buying shoes, Gloria comes across a pair of boots that fit into her budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that cost five dollars less than the boots in total. If one of the pairs of high heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, what is the price of the boots in dollars?

To find the price of the boots, let's denote the price of the boots as \( B \).

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 2 \times 33 = 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. According to the problem, this total cost is five dollars less than the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find \( B \), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 = 104 \]

So, the price of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars.",104,104
polymath-low-fr-30,"Translation: The ages of Darell and Allen are in the ratio of 7:11. If the sum of their current ages is 162, calculate Allen's age in 10 years.

To solve this problem, we start by defining the ages of Darell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let's denote the age of Darell by \(7x\) and the age of Allen by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find the current age of Allen. Since Allen's age is \(11x\), we substitute \(x = 9\) into the expression:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

So, Allen is currently 99 years old. To find Allen's age in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-fr-31,"Translation: Gunter is trying to count candies in a jar. He asks his friends to estimate the quantity. One of them answers 80. Another one says 20 more than half of the first. A third one talks about 25% more than the first. What is the average of their estimates?

To find the average of the estimates, we first need to determine each friend's estimate.

1. The first friend's estimate is 80.
2. The second friend's estimate is 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's estimate} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's estimate is 25% more than the first friend's estimate. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's estimate} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the three estimates: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these estimates and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average of their estimates is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
