mgsm-ru-47,"Translation: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties, which cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total?

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of blue ties John bought and then find out how many red ties he bought. We will also calculate the cost of the red ties and add it to the cost of the blue ties to get the total amount spent.

1. Calculate the number of blue ties John bought:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one blue tie} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of blue ties} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. Determine the cost of one red tie:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of red ties John bought:
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Calculate the total amount spent on ties:
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{800}

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair earns $60.
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair earns $40.
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total earnings for Thursday are:
  \[

To determine Marsi's annual pension if she leaves the company after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the annual pension amount after 20 years of service.
2. Determine the additional pension she earns for working beyond 20 years.

The annual pension after 20 years is $50,000. According to the problem, after 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of the pension amount for each additional year of service. Since she has worked for 30 years, she has worked 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

The additional pension for each of these 10 years is:

2. Calculate the amount paid for the second half of the year:
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140, but it is 10% less than the original charge.
   - Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the amount paid for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars}

To determine how much Sheila will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones including interest and then divide by the number of months.

1. Calculate the total cost of the phones before interest:
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the interest for the entire amount over 3 months. Since the interest rate is 2% per year, the interest for 3 months (which is 1/4 of a year) is:
   \[
   750 \times \frac{2}{100} \times \frac{1}{4} = 750 \times 0.005 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost including interest:
   \[
   750 + 3.75 = 753.75 \text{ dollars}

Usually, he sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Today, Artie doesn't have change, so he decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he earn?

To determine how much Artie will earn, we first need to round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar. The prices are:
- Marigolds: $2.74 \approx $3
- Petunias: $1.87 \approx $2
- Begonias: $2.12 \approx $2

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of flower:
- Earnings from marigolds: \(12 \text{ pots} \times \$3/\text{pot} = \$36\)
- Earnings from petunias: \(9 \text{ pots} \times \$2/\text{pot} = \$18\)
- Earnings from begonias: \(17 \text{ pots} \times \$2/\text{pot} = \$34\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings:

To find the average area of the levels, we first need to determine the area of each level. We know the top level has an area of 16 square feet, and each subsequent level has half the area of the level below it.

Let's denote the area of the top level as \(A_1 = 16\) square feet. Then the area of the second level \(A_2\) is:
\[ A_2 = \frac{A_1}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the third level \(A_3\) is:
\[ A_3 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the fourth level \(A_4\) is:
\[ A_4 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet} \]

Now we have the areas of all four levels: 16, 8, 4, and 2 square feet. To find the average area, we sum these areas and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average level area is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60

Then she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilie use in the first year?
To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilie will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then divide this by the amount of food in one bag.

1. Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   \[
   1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}

To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at both prices and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packs of 3:
- Each pack of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packs of 3 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packs}
  \]
- The total cost for 6 packs is:

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packs of 2:
- Each pack of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packs of 2 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packs}
  \]
- The total cost for 9 packs is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
\[
15 - 9 = 6 \text{ dollars}

Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the babies.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is:
  \[
  20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}

mgsm-ru-2,"Translation: Josh decides to resell a house. He buys the house for 80,000 dollars and invests 50,000 dollars in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. What profit did he make?

To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original purchase price of the house is 80,000 dollars. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. An increase of 150% means the value of the house is now 250% of its original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred. This includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

To find out how many meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers by multiplying the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

First, we determine the total distance James runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\).",540,540
mgsm-ru-4,"Translation: Wendy feeds each of her hens three bowls of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms, and vegetables, every day to maintain their health. She gives her flock of hens feed in three separate feedings. In the morning, she gives her flock 15 bowls of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 bowls of feed. How many bowls of feed does she need to give her flock in the last feeding of the day if her flock consists of 20 hens?

To determine how many bowls of feed Wendy needs to give her hens in the last feeding of the day, we start by calculating the total amount of feed each hen consumes per day. Since each hen is given 3 bowls of feed per day, and there are 20 hens, the total daily feed consumption is:

\[ 3 \text{ bowls/hen/day} \times 20 \text{ hens} = 60 \text{ bowls/day} \]

Next, we know that Wendy has already given her hens 15 bowls in the morning and 25 bowls in the afternoon. The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ bowls} + 25 \text{ bowls} = 40 \text{ bowls} \]

To find out how many bowls of feed are needed for the last feeding, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily feed requirement:

\[ 60 \text{ bowls} - 40 \text{ bowls} = 20 \text{ bowls} \]

Therefore, the number of bowls of feed Wendy needs to give her hens in the last feeding of the day is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
mgsm-ru-5,"Translation: Kyle went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kyle wants to buy 16 glasses. How much should he pay for them?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the glasses Kyle is buying. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the cost of the glasses:
   - The cost of one glass is $5.
   - The cost of every second glass is $5 \times 0.60 = $3.

2. Determine the number of each type of glass Kyle will buy:
   - Since Kyle wants to buy 16 glasses and every second glass is cheaper, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many glasses will be at the reduced price and how many will be at the full price.
   - Number of full-price glasses: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
   - Number of discounted glasses: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Cost of the full-price glasses: \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \)
   - Cost of the discounted glasses: \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \)
   - Total cost: \( 40 + 24 = 64 \)

""In Toulouse, there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston. In Charleston, there are 4 times as many sheep as in Seattle. How many sheep are there in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle combined if there are 20 sheep in Seattle?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of sheep in Seattle be \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).
2. The number of sheep in Charleston is 4 times the number of sheep in Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \( 4S \). Substituting the value of \( S \), we get:
   \[
   4S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. The number of sheep in Toulouse is twice the number of sheep in Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \( 2 \times 4S = 8S \). Substituting the value of \( S \), we get:
   \[
   8S = 8 \times 20 = 160
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle combined. This is the sum of the sheep in each city:
   \[
   160 + 80 + 20 = 260

Normally, she can upload 2 GB per minute, but when the upload is 40% complete, Windows forces a reboot to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla has to restart the upload from the beginning. How long does the file upload take in total?

To determine the total time required for the file upload, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **Calculate the time to upload 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\).
   - Since Carla can upload 2 GB per minute, the time to upload 80 GB is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Add the time for the Windows reboot:**
   - The reboot takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to upload the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120 \text{ GB}\).
   - The time to upload 120 GB is \(\frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Sum the times for all segments:**
   - Time to upload 40% of the file: 40 minutes.
   - Time for the Windows reboot: 20 minutes.
   - Time to upload the remaining 60% of the file: 60 minutes.
   - Total time: \(40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}\).

Therefore, the total time required for the file upload is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes.",120,160

To find the speed Marissa needs to cover the remaining distance, we start by calculating the total time she has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the hike is 12 miles. If her average speed is to be 4 miles per hour, the total time required to complete the hike is:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and 1 hour on the next 2 miles, which totals:
\[
1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the remaining time she has to cover the remaining distance is:
\[
3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

The remaining distance to be covered is:
\[
12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, Marissa needs to cover the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour.",6,6

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after the spill, and then find the total amount of water in the remaining mixture.

1. Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) liters.

2. Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9\) liters.

3. Determine the amount of water in the spilled orange drink:
   - Since one liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water spilled is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67\) liters.

4. Calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange drink after the spill:
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \(\frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6\) liters.

5. Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining mixture:
   - Total water = water from the remaining orange drink + water from the pineapple drink

To determine how much shorter the candle will be after burning from 13:00 to 17:00, we need to calculate the total time the candle is burning and then find out how much it burns down in that time.

1. Calculate the total time the candle is burning:
   - The candle starts burning at 13:00 and stops at 17:00.
   - The time from 13:00 to 17:00 is 4 hours.

2. Determine how much the candle burns down in 4 hours:
   - The candle burns down 2 centimeters per hour.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will burn down \(2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}\).

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 13:00 to 17:00.",0,8
mgsm-ru-24,"Translation: Kyle bought a bestseller from last year for $19.50, which was at a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?

To find the original price of the book, we need to determine what the price would be before the 25% discount was applied. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Since the book was sold at a 25% discount, Kyle paid 75% of the original price. This can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
mgsm-ru-25,"Translation: Mary ordered one chicken dish that costs $12, 5 packages of milk that cost $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and several boxes of pizza. Mary paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Mary order if each box costs $8.50?

To determine how many boxes of pizza Mary ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and apples. Then we can find out how much money was spent on the pizza boxes by subtracting the cost of the chicken dish, milk, and apples from the total amount paid. Finally, we can determine the number of pizza boxes by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of one pizza box.

1. Calculate the cost of the chicken dish:
   \[
   \text{Cost of chicken dish} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the cost of the milk:
   \[
   \text{Cost of milk} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of the apples:
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Calculate the total cost of the chicken dish, milk, and apples:
   \[

To find out how much Mike spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the shorts:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the pants:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50
\]

Then, let's calculate the total cost for the shoes:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126

To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine the number of boxes she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we calculate the total number of portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ portion/day} = 60 \text{ portions} \]

Next, we determine how many boxes of ice cream she will need to buy. Since each box contains 15 portions, we divide the total number of portions by the number of portions per box:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ portions}}{15 \text{ portions/box}} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the price per box:

To find out how many miles Henry rode between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two stops. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile ride. Therefore, his second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.
3. The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the mileages of these two stops, which is \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

So, the number of miles Henry rode between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
mgsm-ru-29,"Translation: Gloria is shopping for shoes when she finds a pair that fits her budget. However, she has to choose between these shoes and two pairs of high-heeled shoes, which together cost five dollars less than the shoes. If one pair of high-heeled shoes costs 33 dollars and the other pair costs twice as much, how much do the shoes cost?
To determine the cost of the shoes, we start by defining the cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes. Let the cost of the first pair of high-heeled shoes be \(33\) dollars. The cost of the second pair is twice that of the first pair, so it is \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is therefore:
\[
33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
\]
According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is five dollars less than the cost of the shoes. Let the cost of the shoes be \(x\) dollars. Then we can write the equation:
\[
x - 99 = 5
\]
To find \(x\), we solve the equation by adding 99 to both sides:
\[
x = 99 + 5 = 104
\]
Thus, the cost of the shoes is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars.",104,104
mgsm-ru-30,"Translation: Darrel's and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. If their combined age is currently 162, calculate Allen's age in 10 years.

To solve this problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrel and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrel's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, their combined age is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find Allen's current age. Since Allen's age is \(11x\), we substitute \(x = 9\):

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

So, Allen is currently 99 years old. To find Allen's age in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109

Another friend says it is 20 more than half of what the first friend said. The third friend says it is 25% more than what the first friend said. What is the average of their guesses?

To find the average of their guesses, we first need to determine each friend's guess.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of 80. We calculate half of 80 as follows:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]
   Adding 20 to 40, we get:
   \[
   40 + 20 = 60
   \]
   So, the second friend's guess is 60.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than 80. We calculate 25% of 80 as follows:
   \[
   0.25 \times 80 = 20
   \]
   Adding 20 to 80, we get:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100
   \]
   So, the third friend's guess is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

To find out how many hours John spends on taking care of the dogs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time John spends on each dog per day.
2. Multiply the daily time by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that each dog requires 0.5 hours per day. Since John has 10 dogs, the total time spent per day on all dogs is:
\[ 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \text{ hours per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily time by 7:

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

To determine how many precious stones Shivon has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many precious stones Aaron has.
2. Use the result from step 1 to find out how many precious stones Shivon has.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 precious stones. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more precious stones than half the number of precious stones Raymond has. So, we calculate half of Raymond's precious stones:
\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]
Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many precious stones Aaron has:
\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]
So, Aaron has 25 precious stones.

Next, we know that Shivon has 2 fewer precious stones than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of precious stones Aaron has:
\[

The calculation for 25% of 4 is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points from the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the sale price.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money John makes from selling his Lego sets and how much he spends on video games, and then find out how many Lego sets he has left.

First, calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/set} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money John spends on video games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/game} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, determine how much money John has left after buying the video games:
\[ 195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can confirm that the remaining $35 is the money he has after buying the video games and having $5 left. Therefore, he did not spend the remaining $35 on any more Lego sets, so the number of Lego sets he has left is:
\[ 13 - 0 = 13 \]

To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, John runs half as long as he does on the first day. So, he runs:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   on each of these days. Therefore, the distance he runs on each of these days is:
   \[
   1.5v \text{ miles}
   \]
   Since he runs for 1.5 hours on each of the two days, the total distance for these two days is:
   \[
   2 \times 1.5v = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles, so:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the supplies needed to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, we calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since each pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 and Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost to make 20 candles is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-ru-46,"Translation: Candice put 80 stickers in her purse before going to work at the coffee shop. On her way, she stopped at a store and bought a pack of stickers. At work, she put one sticker on each of the 220 different coffee cups. If she has 23 stickers left, how many stickers were in the pack she bought?

To determine how many stickers were in the pack Candice bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stickers Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of stickers used from the initial number of stickers plus the number of stickers in the pack to find the number of stickers in the pack.

First, let's find out how many stickers Candice used. She put one sticker on each of the 220 different coffee cups, so she used 220 stickers.

Next, let's denote the number of stickers in the pack as \( x \). Initially, Candice had 80 stickers. After buying the pack and using 220 stickers, she has 23 stickers left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

Add 140 to both sides of the equation to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of stickers in the pack is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163
mgsm-ru-188,"Translation: A trader buys several bags of wheat from a farmer at a price of 20 $ per bag. If the transportation cost for each bag from the farm to the warehouse is 2 $, and the trader made a total profit of 400 $ after selling all the bags at a price of 30 $ each, how many bags did he sell?

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars.
The cost of transportation is \( 2x \) dollars.
The total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.
The revenue from selling the bags is \( 30x \) dollars.
The profit is the revenue minus the total cost, which is given as 400 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags.",50,50

In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as the total she collected in the first and second months combined. How many Pokémon cards does Elaine have now?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 cards.
   \[
   \text{Initial cards} = 20
   \]

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Cards in the first month} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Cards in the second month} = 60 - 20 = 40

Publishing house B pays Mark twice as much as publishing house A. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and publishing house A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much in cents does Mark earn per week?

To determine how much Mark earns per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sentences edited for each publishing house.
2. Calculate the payment from each publishing house.
3. Sum the payments to find the total weekly earnings.

First, since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publishing house, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences per publishing house} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from publishing house A. Since publishing house A pays 5 cents per sentence, the payment from publishing house A is:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publishing house B pays twice as much as publishing house A per sentence. Therefore, publishing house B pays:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]
So, the payment from publishing house B is:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the payments from both publishing houses gives Mark's total weekly earnings:

To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth quiz, we need to determine the sum of her scores after dropping the lowest score and then find the score that will give her an average of 93.

First, identify the lowest score among the first five quizzes:
\[ 71 \]

Next, calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on her sixth quiz. The sum of all six scores, after dropping the lowest score, will be:

To find the total distance Michael rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the distance Michael rode in the first four weeks:
\[ \text{Distance per week} = 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} = 125 \text{ km/week} \]
\[ \text{Total distance for 4 weeks} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 125 \text{ km/week} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of twenty dozen cups. According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of a half-dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 6000 - 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups cost $4800, and one dozen equals 12, twenty dozen cups equal:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]
So, the cost of one cup is:
\[ \frac{4800}{240} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of purchasing each cup is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]",20,145
mgsm-ru-210,"Translation: Sarah wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs 30$, and each pair of shoes costs 20$. Sarah is watching the neighbors' children 4 times, earning 5$ each time she watches them. Her parents pay her 4$ each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already had 10$ saved up before she started watching the children, how many times does she need to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

To determine how many times Sarah needs to mow the lawn, we first calculate the total cost of the jacket and the shoes:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Sarah will have after watching the children 4 times:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
Adding this to the 10 dollars she already had:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Sarah needs to buy the jacket and shoes:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sarah earns 4 dollars each time she mows the lawn, we need to determine how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn 40 dollars:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sarah needs to mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times.",10,10
mgsm-ru-211,"Translation: Jerry has a flock of hens. The red hens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white hens lay 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white hens than red hens, how many red hens does he have?

Let's define the number of red hens as \( r \) and the number of white hens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. The number of white hens is two more than the number of red hens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red hens.",4,4
mgsm-ru-212,"Translation: Gary likes to walk around the boundary of a local park, which is a rectangle measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many hours does he spend walking?

To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park.
2. Determine the time Gary spends walking based on his speed and the perimeter.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Here, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So, the perimeter is:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk 15 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) taken to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]
Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour. So, the time is:
\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking.",5,5

To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers from the first two days.
3. Subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, the total number of customers from the first two days is:
\[ 100 + 150 = 250 \]

The total number of customers by the third day is 500. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is:

mgsm-ru-214,"Translation: Jerry has two pools - both with leaks that drain them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water is currently in the small pool?

To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( L \) be the amount of water in the large pool 4 minutes ago.
- Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   L = 2S
   \]

2. Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, the amount of water in each pool is:
   \[
   L - 4 \times 4 = L - 16
   \]
   \[
   S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16
   \]
   So, now the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   L - 16 = 4(S - 16)
   \]

Substitute \( L = 2S \) into the equation:
\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]
Expand and simplify:
\[
2S - 16 = 4S - 64
\]
Rearrange to isolate \( S \):
\[
64 - 16 = 4S - 2S
\]
\[
48 = 2S
\]
\[
S = 24
\]

So, the small pool currently has \( S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \) gallons of water.

The amount of water currently in the small pool is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,8

To find the remaining amount, we first need to calculate the total amount Genet will pay back. This includes the principal amount plus the interest.

1. Calculate the total amount to be repaid:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200

To solve the problem, we start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}

To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crosswords and the time spent on Sudokus separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crosswords:
\[
\text{Time spent on crosswords} = 3 \text{ crosswords} \times 10 \text{ minutes per crossword} = 30 \text{ minutes}

After losing 8 water-type cards, James will have \(40 - 8 = 32\) water-type cards. After buying 14 grass-type cards, James will have \(20 + 14 = 34\) grass-type cards. The total number of cards James will have is \(30 + 32 + 34 = 96\).

The probability that a randomly selected card will be a water-type card is the number of water-type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is \(\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3}\).

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\). Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 33.

He has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses during the payment. How much does he still owe?

To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito order, we need to add up all the individual costs and then subtract the value of the gift card.

1. Basic burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. Two sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 \times 2 = $0.50

mgsm-ru-234,"Translation: Steve decides to eat more tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as many as his girlfriend. He eats 6 pieces a day. If a branch can produce 3 tomatoes in a week, how many branches does he need?

To determine how many branches Steve needs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many cherry tomatoes Steve eats in a week.
2. Determine how many branches are needed to produce that many tomatoes in a week.

First, we know that Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day. Therefore, in one week (7 days), he eats:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Next, we know that each branch produces 3 cherry tomatoes in a week. To find out how many branches are needed to produce 42 cherry tomatoes in a week, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week by the number of tomatoes each branch produces:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/branch/week}} = 14 \text{ branches} \]

So, Steve needs \(\boxed{14}\) branches.",14,21
mgsm-ru-141,"Translation: In the hive, there are 700 bees. The number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae, and the number of larvae is twice the number of drones. How many worker bees are there?

Let's denote the number of drones by \( d \). According to the problem, the number of larvae is twice the number of drones, so the number of larvae is \( 2d \). The number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2d = 4d \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of drones, larvae, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ d + 2d + 4d = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7d = 700 \]
To find \( d \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ d = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of drones is 100. The number of larvae is \( 2d = 2 \times 100 = 200 \), and the number of worker bees is \( 4d = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\).",400,400

To find out how much money Jordan could earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much money Jordan could earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, we calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours each day and there are 7 days in a week, we have:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Jordan could earn if he worked those 14 hours at his part-time job, where he earns $10 per hour:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

mgsm-ru-143,"Translation: John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and cockroach traps for $4. If a 10% tax is applied to all non-food items, how much did everything cost in total?

To determine the total cost, we first need to identify which items are non-food items and which are food items. The milk is a food item, while the eggs, bulbs, cups, and cockroach traps are non-food items.

The cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13\]

A 10% tax is applied to the non-food items, so the tax amount is:
\[13 \times 0.10 = 1.3\]

Therefore, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[13 + 1.3 = 14.3\]

The cost of the milk is $2. So, the total cost of all items is:
\[2 + 14.3 = 16.3\]

Thus, the total cost is \(\boxed{16.3}\).",3,16
mgsm-ru-144,"Translation: A person started a home cleaning business and is calculating the profit they will make from customers. They already have 3 customers, but they are in talks with 5 potential customers and are confident enough to include them in their calculations. For cleaning each customer's home, it will require 2 bottles of cleaning liquid and a pack of tissues. Each bottle of cleaning liquid will cost $2, and each pack of tissues will cost $5. This is all his expenses. He expects the total income for the week to be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so what profit in dollars will Lucas make each week?

To find the profit, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the total income.

First, let's calculate the total expenses:
- Each customer requires 2 bottles of cleaning liquid and 1 pack of tissues.
- The cost of 2 bottles of cleaning liquid is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 pack of tissues is 5 dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for cleaning one customer's home is \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.
- The total number of customers (including potential ones) is \(3 + 5 = 8\).
- So, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total expenses from the total income to find the profit:
- The total income is $92.
- The total expenses are $72.
- Therefore, the profit is \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars.

The profit Lucas will make each week is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20

To determine how many pineapples John can get in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples on the entire field.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest the field in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples on the field:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we determine how many times John can harvest the field in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the number of pineapples John can get in a year is \(\boxed{4000}\).",4000,4000

He spilled a set of 500 pieces and another set, which has 3 times as many pieces as the box with 500 pieces, and also another set, where the number of pieces is 1/4 of this amount. How many blocks will Johnny collect if he picks up all the Lego pieces?

To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny will collect, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them up.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of pieces in the second set:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375

Then she sees that half of this number of bees returns in the next 6 hours. In the following 6 hours, she sees twice as many bees flying out and leaving the hive as those that first flew out. Then, each bee that flew out and did not return earlier comes back to the hive in the last 6 hours. How many bees returning to the hive did Debra see in the last 6 hours of the day?

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees fly out.
2. **Next 6 hours**: Half of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Following 6 hours**: Twice as many bees fly out and leave as those that first flew out, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Last 6 hours**: Each of the 15 bees that returned earlier in the day, plus the 60 bees that flew out and did not return, come back to the hive. So, the total number of bees returning is \( 15 + 60 = 75 \).

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier. We know the cost of the tickets and the change she received.

First, calculate the total cost of the tickets:
- The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.
- Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $10 = $22.

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Let \( x \) be the amount of money she gave to the cashier. The relationship between the amount given, the total cost of the tickets, and the change received can be expressed as:
\[ x - 22 = 8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 22 + 8 \]
\[ x = 30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30. The final answer is:

mgsm-ru-149,"Translation: Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, how many friends does James have on Facebook?

To find out how many friends James has on Facebook, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many friends Dorothy has on Facebook.
2. Use the number of friends Dorothy has to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} = \frac{\text{Number of friends Charlie has}}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]
So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of friends James has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of friends James has} = 4 \times \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of friends James has on Facebook is \(\boxed{16}\).",16,16

Steve lives 3 miles from school and can ride a bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school. If Tim can ride a skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner have to wait at home for the loser to finish the race?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, and he will have to wait for Tim to finish the race. The difference in their times is:

mgsm-ru-151,"Translation: Shonda decided that the neighborhood children could benefit from a service to inflate bicycle tires. She decided to charge for each tire inflated. Inflating each tire costs 25 cents. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came to inflate both tires. 3 people came to inflate all the tires on their tricycles. Finally, one person came on a unicycle. How much money did she earn that day?

To determine how much money Shonda earned, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars.

1. Calculate the number of tires inflated for the bicycles:
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came on bicycles.
   - Therefore, the total number of tires inflated for bicycles is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

2. Calculate the number of tires inflated for the tricycles:
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came on tricycles.
   - Therefore, the total number of tires inflated for tricycles is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

3. Calculate the number of tires inflated for the unicycle:
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came on a unicycle.
   - Therefore, the total number of tires inflated for the unicycle is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).

4. Calculate the total number of tires inflated:
   - Total tires inflated = tires from bicycles + tires from tricycles + tires from unicycle.
   - Total tires inflated = \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

5. Calculate the total earnings:
   - Each tire is inflated for 25 cents, which is $0.25.
   - Therefore, the total earnings are \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

mgsm-ru-153,"Translation: Dave bought a large package of potato chips and ate fourteen while a hungry seagull stole the package from his hand. When the seagull landed, it took half of the number of potato chips that Dave had eaten. Then three pigeons chased it away, and each pigeon ate three chips. After that, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining chips. Ants carried away the last chip, leaving five. How many potato chips were in the package when Dave bought it?

To solve the problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of chips.

1. Let's denote the initial number of chips in the package as \( x \).
2. Dave ate 14 chips, so the number of chips left after Dave ate is \( x - 14 \).
3. The seagull took half of the chips Dave had eaten, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) chips. So, the number of chips left after the seagull took its share is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 chips, so the number of chips left after the pigeons ate is \( x - 21 - 3 \times 3 = x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
5. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining chips, so the number of chips left after the raccoon ate is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining chips, which is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).
6. The ants carried away the last chip, leaving 5 chips, so we have \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18

\[
x = 48

How much farther did the winner run compared to the loser?

To determine who ran farther and by how much, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake ran:
- Blake runs from one end to the other and back, which is \(100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards}\).
- He does this 15 times, so the total distance Blake ran is \(200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}\).

- Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is \(40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards}\).
- She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly ran is \(80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}\).

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake ran 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran 2720 yards.
- The difference in distance is \(3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards}\).

At the same time, Lokesin caught 5 fewer sea stars than Anakin, 3 fewer sea urchins than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish did they catch in total?

To find out how many fish Anakin and Lokesin caught in total, we need to determine how many of each type of fish Lokesin caught and then sum up all the fish caught by both.

First, let's calculate how many sea stars Lokesin caught:
Anakin caught 10 sea stars, so Lokesin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) sea stars.

Next, let's calculate how many sea urchins Lokesin caught:
Anakin caught 6 sea urchins, so Lokesin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea urchins.

Then, let's calculate how many clownfish Lokesin caught:
Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Lokesin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we can find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Lokesin:
- Anakin caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea urchins, and 3 clownfish, which totals \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.
- Lokesin caught 5 sea stars, 3 sea urchins, and 5 clownfish, which totals \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of balloons after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months. First, we determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times. The price after each 2-month period is multiplied by 1.20 (which is 100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20). Therefore, the price after 36 months will be:

\[ 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator:

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 21.8824 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:

\[ 20 \times 21.8824 \approx 437.65 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price will be:

\[ \boxed{437.65} \]",65,92

To find the total cost of all the toys, we need to determine the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of one figurine**: Given as $5.
2. **Cost of the doll**: Since the doll is worth as much as 3 figurines, the cost of the doll is:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of one red car**: Given as $4.
4. **Cost of all red cars**: Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is:

Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that their combined age in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule. A week consists of 7 days, with 2 of those days being weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

1. Calculate the miles walked on weekdays (Monday to Friday):
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day on weekdays.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays is \(20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles}\).

2. Calculate the miles walked on weekends (Saturday and Sunday):
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day on weekends.

To determine the total cost of one uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the coat is three times the cost of the hat. Therefore, the cost of the coat is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}

Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade. To make one gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They sell each cup for $0.50 and get 20 cups from each gallon. If they made a $25 profit, how much did they spend on lemons?

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many gallons of lemonade Juan and Carlos sold to make a $25 profit and then calculate the total cost of the lemons.

First, let's find out how much they earn from selling one gallon of lemonade. They sell 20 cups per gallon and each cup is sold for $0.50, so:
\[ 20 \text{ cups/gallon} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 10 \text{ dollars/gallon} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost to make one gallon of lemonade. The cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars (lemons)} + 2 \text{ dollars (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars/gallon} \]

The profit from selling one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars (revenue)} - 5 \text{ dollars (cost)} = 5 \text{ dollars/gallon} \]

If they made a $25 profit, we can find out how many gallons they sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per gallon:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ dollars/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the lemons for 5 gallons. Since each gallon costs $3 in lemons, the total cost of the lemons is:

If Zayid earns $6000 per month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?""

To solve this, we will break down Zayid's expenses step by step.

1. Calculate the amount spent on housing rent:
\[ \text{Housing rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Calculate the remaining amount after housing rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white carnations first. Let's denote the number of white carnations by \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4x \).
2. The number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5x = 200 \).

We can solve for \( x \) from the second equation:
\[
5x = 200 \implies x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( x = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Gin and Mark based on the given information.

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30 years.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years.
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was five years more than half of Jan's age at that time.

The other team is less prepared; its first runner runs their 400-meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner runs 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Using this information, determine how many seconds the faster team will win by.

To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the relay race.

For the well-prepared team:

To determine how much more likely it is that the number rolled is greater than 3 than that two even numbers are rolled consecutively, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the probability that the number rolled is greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability that the number rolled is greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability that two even numbers are rolled consecutively. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is that the number rolled is greater than 3 than that two even numbers are rolled consecutively. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:
\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]
\[
\text{Difference in percentages} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

mgsm-ru-186,"Translation: Russell works in a pet store and distributes hay to rodents. Rats are kept in 3 cages in groups of the same size and each rat is given 6 brikets of hay. There are 10 cages with hamsters, each kept individually, and each hamster is given 5 brikets of hay. There is also a pen with rabbits, on which 20 brikets of hay are distributed. No hay is used anywhere else in the store. If among the small rodents, 160 brikets of hay were distributed, how many rats are in each cage?

To determine how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the total number of brikets of hay given to the hamsters and then use the remaining hay to find the number of rats.

First, calculate the total number of brikets of hay given to the hamsters:
\[
10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ brikets per hamster} = 50 \text{ brikets}
\]

Next, subtract the number of brikets given to the hamsters from the total number of brikets distributed to the small rodents:
\[
160 \text{ brikets} - 50 \text{ brikets} = 110 \text{ brikets}
\]

These 110 brikets are given to the rats. Since each rat receives 6 brikets, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total number of brikets given to the rats by the number of brikets each rat receives:
\[
\frac{110 \text{ brikets}}{6 \text{ brikets per rat}} = \frac{110}{6} = \frac{55}{3} \approx 18.33
\]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the problem states that the rats are in groups of the same size, the only possible whole number solution is 18 rats (as 18 is the closest whole number that fits the division).

Now, we need to determine how many rats are in each of the 3 cages. We divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[
\frac{18 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 6 \text{ rats per cage}
\]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,5
mgsm-ru-187,"Translation: Mandi owes Benedict 100 dollars. They agreed on monthly interest at a rate of 2%. If Mandi can pay off the entire amount in 3 months, how much should she pay Benedict in total?

To determine how much Mandi should pay Benedict in total, we need to calculate the interest accrued over the 3 months and add it to the original amount.

1. **Calculate the interest for each month:**
   - The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: \(0.02\).
   - The interest for the first month is \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\) dollars.
   - The interest for the second month is \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\) dollars.
   - The interest for the third month is \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total interest over 3 months:**
   - The total interest is \(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid:**
   - The total amount is the original amount plus the total interest: \(100 + 6 = 106\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Mandi should pay Benedict is \(\boxed{106}\).",106,106

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of pet animals in the residential area. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the number of dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. Determine the number of cats. According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   \text{Total number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. Determine the number of rabbits. The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve times less than the total number of dogs and cats. This means the number of rabbits is one-twelfth of the total number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{\text{Total number of dogs and cats}}{12} = \frac{180}{12} = 15
   \]

5. Calculate the total number of pet animals in the residential area:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pet animals} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 15 = 195

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of the time that Harry slept, we calculate:

\[
\text{James's sleep time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept compared to James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

First, we need to determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked. Since the sauce loses half of its volume during cooking, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce. The sauce weighs 32 ounces, so the original volume of the tomatoes is:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes were used. Each can of tomatoes weighs 16 ounces, so the number of cans used is:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes used by Frida is \(\boxed{12}\).",12,12

Several cars passed in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then another 20 cars passed in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. 5 cars from the queue left the road, so they didn't have to go through the traffic jam. If there were 30 cars on the highway from the start, how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

To determine how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of cars that were initially on the highway.
2. Determine how many cars left the highway.
3. Calculate the number of cars that remained on the highway after some left.
4. Determine how many of these remaining cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Let's start with the initial number of cars:
- Initially, there were 30 cars on the highway.

Next, we account for the cars that left the highway:
- 5 cars left the highway, so the number of cars remaining on the highway is:
  \[
  30 - 5 = 25
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these 25 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. We know that a total of 20 cars passed through the traffic jam in the last 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam minus the number of cars that passed through in the last 15 minutes:
\[
\text{Number of cars that passed in the first 15 minutes} = 25 - 20 = 5

She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window sills in her large country house. Out of generosity, she decided that tomorrow she will give 1 potted plant from each window sill to friends and relatives. How many potted plants will Mary have left?

To determine how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Determine how many potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has.

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/sill} \times 40 \text{ sills} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we calculate how many potted plants she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/sill} \times 40 \text{ sills} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has:

The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring in total?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Determine how many times the second friend rang the doorbell.
   The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend rang it 20 times, we calculate:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, the second friend rang the doorbell 25 times.

2. Determine how many times the third friend rang the doorbell.
   The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend rang it 60 times, we calculate:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]
   So, the third friend rang the doorbell 70 times.

3. Calculate the total number of times the doorbell rang.
   We add the number of times each friend rang the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

To find the internal volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension to get the internal dimensions. The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the thickness of the walls is 1 inch, the internal dimensions will be:

- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

The internal volume of one box is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Internal Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}

When he finishes baking, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he intended. He drops 5 cookies when he puts them to cool down, and now he has only 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wants to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he wants to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110

   \[
   2x = 100

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline without the cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of 10 gallons.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline without the cashback.

If they had eaten all of this, how many roll-ups on average would they have eaten?""

To determine the average number of roll-ups they would have eaten, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them has and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Beatrice has:
- Beatrice's roll-up is twice as wide as a regular roll-up and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Marcel has:
- Marcel's roll-up is three times as wide as a regular roll-up and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcel has is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we find the total number of roll-ups they have together:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

To find the average number of roll-ups they would have eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2:

She rowed twenty feet in sixteen seconds. It took her sixty-four seconds to reach the shore. How many liters of water were in the boat when Julia reached the shore?

To determine how much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she traveled and the amount of water that entered the boat during that time.

First, we find the rate at which Julia rows. She rowed twenty feet in sixteen seconds, so her rowing speed is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we calculate the total distance she traveled to reach the shore. Since it took her sixty-four seconds to reach the shore, the total distance is:
\[
\text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much water entered the boat. The boat takes on two liters of water for every ten feet traveled. Therefore, the amount of water that entered the boat is:
\[
\text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}

Next, we subtract the number of flowers that do not grow from the total number of flowers planted:
\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

Therefore, the number of flowers Ryan will have after 15 days is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
mgsm-ru-114,"Translation: In Jamal's phone, the number of photos that can be stored is 6 times more than in Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos that can be stored in Brittany's phone is 50 times the number of ducks on the photo that Jamal took in the zoo. If Jamal's phone can store up to 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen on the photo that Jamal took in the zoo?

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of photos Brittany's phone can store.
2. Use the information about the number of photos Brittany's phone can store to find out how many ducks are on the photo Jamal took.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos and that this number is 6 times the number of photos Brittany's phone can store. Let's denote the number of photos Brittany's phone can store as \( B \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]
So, Brittany's phone can store 300 photos.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks on the photo Jamal took. Let's denote the number of ducks on the photo Jamal took as \( D \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]
So, the number of ducks on the photo Jamal took is \( 6 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]",6,6
mgsm-ru-115,"Translation: Sasha noticed that the prices of lumber have increased by 50% over the last few months since she bought some lumber. Since she has some leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has ten 2x4x10 boards, each of which cost her $10, and five 4x4x10 boards, each of which she bought for $16. How much profit will she make if she sells them all?

To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate her total cost and her total revenue from selling the lumber, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, calculate the total cost of the 2x4x10 boards:
\[
10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
\]

Next, calculate the total cost of the 4x4x10 boards:
\[
5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80
\]

Now, find the total cost of all the boards:
\[
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Since the prices have increased by 50%, the new prices are:
\[
\$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per 2x4x10 board}
\]
\[
\$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per 4x4x10 board}
\]

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2x4x10 boards:
\[
10 \text{ boards} \times \$15 \text{ per board} = \$150
\]

Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4x4x10 boards:
\[
5 \text{ boards} \times \$24 \text{ per board} = \$120
\]

Now, find the total revenue from selling all the boards:
\[
\$150 + \$120 = \$270
\]

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Thus, the profit Sasha will make is \(\boxed{90}\).",90,90
mgsm-ru-116,"Translation: Kayti makes coffee using a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar she used.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Kayti used. We know the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, and the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 120.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar by \(7x\) and the number of cups of water by \(13x\). According to the problem, the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 13x = 120\]
\[20x = 120\]
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by substituting \(x = 6\) into the expression for the number of teaspoons of sugar:
\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

So, the number of teaspoons of sugar Kayti used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

The next day, new containers were delivered, and the total number of vehicles in the port was 30. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day, assuming all containers contain 5 vehicles each.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of containers imported on the second day. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Vehicles:**
   - The customs officer initially counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the initial number of vehicles is:
     \[
     2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. **Total Number of Vehicles After the Second Day:**
   - The total number of vehicles in the port after the second day is 30.

3. **Number of Vehicles Added on the Second Day:**
   - The number of vehicles added on the second day is the difference between the total number of vehicles after the second day and the initial number of vehicles:
     \[
     30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

4. **Number of Containers Imported on the Second Day:**
   - Each container contains 5 vehicles. Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
     \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
mgsm-ru-119,"Translate the question into English:
""The total salary of Adrien was 30 percent higher than Lila's. Four years later, his salary increased, and he started earning 40 percent more than he did four years ago. If their salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate how much they earned together four years later.""

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lila's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lila's salary four years later.
4. Sum their salaries four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lila's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since his salary was 30% higher than Lila's, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 40000 = 1.3 \times \text{Lila's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lila's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Four years later, his salary increased by 40%, so:
\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lila's salary four years later.**

Since their salaries increased simultaneously by the same percentage, Lila's salary four years later is:
\[ \text{Lila's salary four years later} = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum their salaries four years later.**

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the total salary four years later is:

To determine the total number of fruits brought by Morizett and Kaila, we need to calculate the number of fruits each of them brought and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many fruits Kaila brought:
- Kaila brought twice as many apples as Morizett. Since Morizett brought 5 apples, Kaila brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kaila brought half as many oranges as Morizett. Since Morizett brought 8 oranges, Kaila brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits brought by each person:
- Morizett brought \(5\) apples and \(8\) oranges, so the total number of fruits Morizett brought is \(5 + 8 = 13\).
- Kaila brought \(10\) apples and \(4\) oranges, so the total number of fruits Kaila brought is \(10 + 4 = 14\).

Finally, we add the total number of fruits brought by Morizett and Kaila:

To determine the total number of hours Seidy slept in the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours day by day.

1. **Monday**: Seidy slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Seidy slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Seidy slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
4. **Thursday to Sunday**: Seidy slept 1 hour more than the total sleep in Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total sleep in Tuesday and Wednesday is \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours. So, from Thursday to Sunday, she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours.

Now, we sum up the sleep hours for the entire week:
\[8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 11 \text{ (Thursday to Sunday)} = 29\]

Thus, the total number of hours Seidy slept in the week is \(\boxed{29}\).",29,48

polymath-low-ru-33,"Translation: Gretchen has 110 coins. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

polymath-low-ru-38,"Translation: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half that time on the other two days he runs. How fast does he run?

To determine John's running speed, we need to find out how many miles he runs each day and then calculate his average speed.

1. **Calculate the distance John runs on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance John runs on the other two days:**
   John runs half the time on the other two days, so he runs for \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each of these days. The distance he runs on each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = 1.5v \text{ miles}
   \]
   Since he runs on two such days, the total distance for these two days is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance on the other two days} = 2 \times 1.5v = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance John runs in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances he runs on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles, so:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10

The supplies for one pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what will be his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the supplies for 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the supplies for 20 candles.**

Since 1 pound of beeswax is needed to make 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of the supplies for 1 pound of beeswax is $10.00, so the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:

On her way, she stopped at a store and bought a pack of stickers; at work, she put one sticker on each of 220 different coffee cups. If she has 23 stickers left, how many stickers were in the pack she bought?

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many stickers were in the pack Candice bought. Let's denote the number of stickers in the pack as \( x \).

First, we know that Candice initially had 80 stickers. After buying the pack, she had \( 80 + x \) stickers. At work, she used 220 stickers, so she had \( 80 + x - 220 \) stickers left. According to the problem, she has 23 stickers left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Next, we simplify the equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

The total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded into the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded into the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the maximum weight the bridge can support after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this maximum weight.

First, let's find the maximum weight the bridge can support after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck:
\[
5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
\]
This means the total weight of the boxes that can be loaded into the truck is 1245 pounds.

Next, we need to determine how many boxes can be loaded into the truck. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide the maximum allowable weight by the weight of each box:
\[
\frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \text{ boxes}
\]
Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded into the truck is 83.

To determine Marsi's annual pension if she leaves the company after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the annual pension amount after 30 years.
2. Calculate the additional pension she receives for working more than 20 years.

The annual pension after 30 years is still $50,000 because the problem does not specify any change in the pension amount after 30 years. However, after 20 years, she has the right to an additional 5% of the pension amount for each additional year of service.

Since Marsi has worked for 30 years, she has 10 additional years of service beyond the 20-year mark. Therefore, she will receive an additional 5% for each of these 10 years.

The additional pension amount is calculated as follows:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 \times 10 = 25,000 \]

So, her total annual pension after 30 years is:
\[ 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000 \]

If the streaming company took the initial amount for the first half of the year, and then took $10\%$ less money for the remaining half of the year, calculate the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aлина paid for the streaming service over the course of a year. The year is divided into two halves: the first half and the second half.

1. Calculate the amount paid for the first half of the year:
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the total amount for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. Calculate the amount paid for the second half of the year:
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $10\%$ less than $140.
   - First, find $10\%$ of $140$:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Subtract this from $140$ to get the reduced monthly charge:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars}

Sofia wants to know how many miles she can drive on a full tank of gas. Since her last fill-up, she has driven 100 miles and needed to add 4 gallons of gas to refill the tank. The car's user manual states that the tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sofia drive on a full tank of gas?

To answer the question, we need to determine the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out how many miles Sofia can drive on a full tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
\[
\text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance driven}}{\text{Gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Next, we use the fuel efficiency to find out how many miles Sofia can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:
\[
\text{Miles on a full tank} = \text{Fuel efficiency} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}

polymath-low-ru-75,"Translation: Luke spends time at the beach building sandcastles. Eventually, he notices that each level of the sandcastle has half the area of the level below it. If he builds a 4-level sandcastle, with the top level having an area of 16 square feet, what is the average area of a level?

To find the average area of a level, we first need to determine the area of each level of the sandcastle. We know the top level has an area of 16 square feet, and each level below has half the area of the level above it.

Let's denote the areas of the levels from top to bottom as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4\). We know:
\[A_1 = 16 \text{ square feet}\]
\[A_2 = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet}\]
\[A_3 = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet}\]
\[A_4 = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet}\]

The total area of the sandcastle is the sum of the areas of all four levels:
\[A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}\]

The average area of a level is the total area divided by the number of levels:
\[\text{Average area} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}\]

Thus, the average area of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60
polymath-low-ru-76,"Translation: Cecilie just bought a new puppy. According to the veterinarian, she needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. Then, she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilie use in the first year?
To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilie will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then divide this by the amount of food in one bag.

First, we calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required to provide 180 cups of food. Since each bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilie cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food to ensure she has enough for the first year.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]",2,5
polymath-low-ru-77,"Translation: If Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash if Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry each person washes and then find the difference between the amounts washed by Raymond and David.

1. Let the amount of laundry David washes be \( D \) pounds.
2. Since Sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as David, the amount of laundry Sarah washes is \( 4D \) pounds.
3. We are given that Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4D = 400
   \]
4. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]
   So, David washes 100 pounds of laundry.
5. Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah washes 400 pounds, the amount of laundry Raymond washes is:
   \[
   \frac{400}{2} = 200
   \]
   So, Raymond washes 200 pounds of laundry.
6. The difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David is:
   \[
   200 - 100 = 100

To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at both prices and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packs of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packs needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packs of 2 for $1 each:
- Number of packs needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- Cost at the better price: $9
- Cost at the less favorable price: $15
- Savings: \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars

Thus, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price.",18,6

Let's denote the number of games the team won by \( W \) and the number of games they lost by \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22, so we have the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we have the equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

When it rang for the first time today, it rang four times. When it rang for the second time, it rang three times longer than the first time. The third time it rang, it rang half as many times as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in total?

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of times the alarm rang each time it went off and then sum these values.

1. **First time the alarm rang:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.
   - So, the number of rings is \(4\).

2. **Second time the alarm rang:**
   - The alarm rang three times longer than the first time.
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, three times longer means \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
   - So, the number of rings is \(12\).

3. **Third time the alarm rang:**
   - The alarm rang half as many times as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, half as many times means \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.
   - So, the number of rings is \(6\).

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three times:

To determine the total number of pets that Jennifer, Marsia, and Cindy have, we start by finding out how many pets each person has.

First, we know that Cindy has 4 pets. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as \( C \). So, \( C = 4 \).

Next, we know that Marsia has two more pets than Cindy. Let's denote the number of pets Marsia has as \( M \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = C + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Then, we know that Jennifer has three times as many pets as Marsia. Let's denote the number of pets Jennifer has as \( J \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ J = 3 \times M = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of pets that Jennifer, Marsia, and Cindy have together. We add the number of pets each person has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants that will remain with Mary is \(\boxed{58}\).",58,58

""Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him once. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring in total?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Determine how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell.
   The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed it:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times}
   \]

2. Determine how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell.
   The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed it:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of times the doorbell rang.
   Add the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
   \]

So, the total number of times the doorbell rang is \(\boxed{175}\).",175,175

polymath-low-ru-103,"Translation: A fog bank moves from the ocean, covering the city. The fog covers 3 miles of the city every 10 minutes. If the width of the city is 42 miles from the ocean shore to the opposite land boundary, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the entire city?

To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by calculating the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire width of the city, which is 42 miles. We use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

polymath-low-ru-104,"Translation: Poppy is putting together a 1000-piece puzzle. She puts a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mother puts a third of the remaining pieces. How many puzzle pieces are left to put on the board?

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy puts on the board initially.
2. Determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces.
3. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy's mother puts on the board.
4. Determine the number of pieces left to be put on the board.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Poppy puts a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces Poppy puts on the board} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, after Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

2. Poppy's mother then puts a third of the remaining 750 pieces on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces Poppy's mother puts on the board} = \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]
   So, after Poppy's mother places her pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500

To solve this problem, we start by determining how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times more cookies than Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies eaten by Cody} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir by adding the number of cookies each one eats:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies eaten by Cody} + \text{Cookies eaten by Amir} = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they eat together is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
polymath-low-ru-106,"Translation: John has 3 boxes. Each box has dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The thickness of the walls is 1 inch. What is the total internal volume of all 3 boxes?

To find the internal volume of each box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension to get the internal dimensions. The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The thickness of the walls is 1 inch, so the internal dimensions are:

\[
(5 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (6 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (4 - 2) \text{ inches} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches}
\]

The internal volume of one box is:

\[
3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total internal volume of all 3 boxes is:

\[

On Wednesday, he watched several 30-minute episodes of a show. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode. On Friday, he could go to bed late before the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched TV for a total of 7 hours, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

To find out how many 30-minute episodes Franky watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV on the other days and then determine how much time he spent on Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the time spent watching TV on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time spent watching TV on Thursday:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Then, let's calculate the time spent watching TV on Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since Franky watched TV for a total of 7 hours, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Franky watched on Wednesday is \(\boxed{3}\).",3,3

When he finishes baking, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he intended. He drops 5 cookies when he puts them to cool down, and now he has only 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wants to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he planned, so he actually bakes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   \[
   2x = 110 - 10
   \]
   \[
   2x = 100

To determine the cost after receiving the cashback, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline without the cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline without the cashback.
The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
The cashback per gallon is $0.20, so for 10 gallons:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 2 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Unfortunately, someone made a mistake, and Beatrice ended up with a roll that is twice as wide as a regular roll and 24 rolls long, while Marcel has a roll that is three times as wide as a regular roll and 14 rolls long. If they had eaten all of this, how many rolls on average would they have eaten?

To determine the average number of fruit rolls eaten by Marcel and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit rolls each of them has.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her roll is twice that of a regular roll.
- The length of her roll is 24 regular rolls.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit rolls Beatrice has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcel:
- The width of his roll is three times that of a regular roll.
- The length of his roll is 14 regular rolls.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit rolls Marcel has is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit rolls they have together:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

To find the average number of fruit rolls eaten by each of them, we divide the total number of fruit rolls by 2:
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

Thus, the average number of fruit rolls they would have eaten is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
polymath-low-ru-111,"When Julia was at the lake, her boat started taking on water. While she was rowing back to the shore, for every ten feet the boat traveled, two liters of water entered the boat. She rowed twenty feet in sixteen seconds. It took her sixty-four seconds to reach the shore. How many liters of water were in the boat when Julia reached the shore?

To determine how much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she traveled and the amount of water that entered the boat during that time.

First, we find the rate at which Julia rows. She rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her rowing speed is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time she spent rowing. She took 64 seconds to reach the shore. We need to determine the total distance she traveled. Using her rowing speed, the total distance is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much water entered the boat. We know that for every ten feet the boat traveled, two liters of water entered the boat. Therefore, the total amount of water that entered the boat is:
\[
\text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore is:

1. Each teacher uses the chalkboard for 2 lessons per day.
2. Each lesson involves 3 cleanings of the chalkboard.
3. Therefore, each teacher cleans the chalkboard \(2 \times 3 = 6\) times per day.

polymath-low-ru-113,"Translation: Ryan plants 2 flowers every day in his garden. How many flowers will he have after 15 days if 5 of them do not grow?

To determine how many flowers Ryan will have after 15 days, we start by calculating the total number of flowers he plants over the 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers each day, we multiply the number of days by the number of flowers planted per day:

\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that 5 of these flowers do not grow. Therefore, we subtract the number of flowers that do not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers Ryan will have after 15 days is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25

If Jamal's phone can store up to 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen on the photo that Jamal took in the zoo?

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of photos Brittany's phone can store.
2. Use the information about the number of photos Brittany's phone can store to find out how many ducks are on the photo Jamal took.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos and that this is 6 times the number of photos Brittany's phone can store. Therefore, we can find the number of photos Brittany's phone can store by dividing 1800 by 6:
\[
\text{Number of photos Brittany's phone can store} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
\]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks on the photo Jamal took. So, we can find the number of ducks on the photo by dividing 300 by 50:
\[
\text{Number of ducks on the photo} = \frac{300}{50} = 6

Since she has some leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has ten 2x4x10 boards, each of which cost her $10, and five 4x4x10 boards, each of which she bought for $16. How much profit will she make if she sells them all?

To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate her total cost of the lumber and then subtract this from the total revenue she will receive from selling the lumber.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2x4x10 boards:
\[
10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4x4x10 boards:
\[
5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80
\]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the lumber:
\[
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Next, we need to determine the selling price of each type of board. Since the prices have increased by 50%, the new price of each 2x4x10 board is:
\[
\$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
\]

And the new price of each 4x4x10 board is:
\[
\$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
\]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
\[
10 \text{ boards} \times \$15 \text{ per board} = \$150
\]
\[
5 \text{ boards} \times \$24 \text{ per board} = \$120

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar by \(7x\) and the number of cups of water by \(13x\). The total amount of sugar and water used is given by the equation:
\[7x + 13x = 120\]
\[20x = 120\]
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for sugar:
\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar Keity used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs per child} = 6 \text{ pairs}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost of the shoes. Since each pair of shoes costs 60 $, the total cost is:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of containers imported on the second day. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles in the containers counted on the first day:
   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day. Each of these containers also contains 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles in the containers imported on the second day is:
   \[
   5x \text{ vehicles}
   \]

3. The total number of vehicles in the port after the second day is the sum of the vehicles from the first day and the vehicles from the second day:
   \[
   10 + 5x = 30
   \]

4. Solve the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   10 + 5x = 30

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
polymath-low-ru-119,"Translation: Adrian's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lila's. Four years later, his salary increased, and he started earning 40 percent more than he did four years ago. If Adrian and Lila's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrian was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate how much they earned together four years later.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Adrian's current salary.
2. Determine Lila's current salary.
3. Calculate the total salary of Adrian and Lila four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Adrian's current salary.**

Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000. Four years later, his salary increased by 40%. Therefore, his current salary is:
\[ 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Lila's current salary.**

Four years ago, Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lila's. Let Lila's salary four years ago be \( L \). Then:
\[ 40,000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30 \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Lila's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23. Since both salaries increased by the same percentage (40%), Lila's current salary is:
\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total salary of Adrian and Lila four years later.**

The total salary of Adrian and Lila four years later is:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Therefore, the total amount they earned together four years later is:

Therefore, the total number of hours Seidy slept this week is 8 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 6 (Wednesday) + 13 (Thursday) + the unknown number of hours for Friday and Saturday. Since the problem does not specify the number of hours she slept on Friday and Saturday, we can only calculate the hours for the days mentioned. Adding the hours for the days we know, we get:

8 + 6 + 6 + 13 = 33 hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Seidy slept this week is $\boxed{33}$.",33,48
polymath-low-ru-123,"Translation: Rose can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. After that, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours?

To determine how many miles Rose can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

1. Calculate the distance Rose runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Calculate the remaining time after the first 3 hours:
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the distance Rose runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. Add the two distances together to find the total distance Rose can run in 7 hours:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Rose can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\) miles.",50,50
polymath-low-ru-124,"Translation: Jenny helps her mom at the office. She has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps attached, and a pile of letters with already attached stamps. She attached stamps to one third of the letters without stamps. If now there are 30 letters in the pile with already attached stamps, how many were there in this pile when Jenny started working?

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many letters with already attached stamps Jenny started with. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the total number of letters that need stamps attached. This is 60 letters.
2. Determine how many letters Jenny attached stamps to. Since she attached stamps to one third of the letters without stamps, she attached stamps to \(\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20\) letters.
3. After attaching stamps to 20 letters, the number of letters without stamps is \(60 - 20 = 40\).
4. Now, we know that the pile with already attached stamps now has 30 letters. This means that the number of letters with already attached stamps when Jenny started working plus the 20 letters she attached stamps to equals the current number of letters with already attached stamps plus the 20 letters she attached stamps to. So, if \(x\) is the number of letters with already attached stamps when Jenny started working, then \(x + 20 = 30\).
5. Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 30 - 20 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of letters with already attached stamps when Jenny started working is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10

To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required. Since John has 20 friends and each friend can take 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to provide 80 slices. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pizzas needed is:

mgsm-ru-236,"Translation: Ram uses many pens. He found out that he can save money by mixing ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs out, how many pens will he have in total?

To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of making new pens from the empty ones. Initially, Ram has 25 pens. As he uses them, he can make new pens by combining the ink from five empty pens into one full pen.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
2. After using these pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
3. He can use these 25 empty pens to make 5 new pens (since 25 divided by 5 is 5).
4. Now, he has 5 new pens and 20 pens that are still full (since he used 20 pens to make the 5 new pens).
5. So, he now has 25 (initial pens) - 20 (used pens) + 5 (new pens) = 10 pens.

However, this is not the end of the process. He can repeat the process with the 10 pens. Let's see how many new pens he can make from these 10 pens:

1. He has 10 pens, and he can use 5 of them to make 1 new pen.
2. Now he has 1 new pen and 5 pens that are still full.
3. So, he now has 10 (initial pens) - 5 (used pens) + 1 (new pen) = 6 pens.

Again, he can repeat the process with these 6 pens:

1. He has 6 pens, and he can use 5 of them to make 1 new pen.
2. Now he has 1 new pen and 1 pen that is still full.
3. So, he now has 6 (initial pens) - 5 (used pens) + 1 (new pen) = 2 pens.

Finally, he can use these 2 pens to make 0 new pens because he needs 5 pens to make 1 new pen, and he only has 2 pens left.

So, the total number of pens he will have is 2.

The final answer is $\boxed{2}$.",2,31

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan based on the information given, and then find the sum of their ages along with Jessica's age.

1. We know that Jessica is 20 years old.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessica, so:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = 25 - 2 = 23

After the assembly, 30% of the students left through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, and the rest left through exit C. Calculate the number of students who left through exit C.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the number of students who left through exit A:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students left through exit A.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after some left through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students remained.

3. Calculate the number of students who left through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27

1. Doll has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Doll will read Pandora's 1 book.
4. Pandora will read Doll's 2 books.

Now, let's count the total number of books read:

- Doll reads her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Doll reads \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.
- Pandora reads her own 1 book and Doll's 2 books, so Pandora reads \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

To determine how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives per week.
2. Determine the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response.
3. Calculate the total time Mike spends writing in minutes.
4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives per week.**

Mike receives letters from 5 - 2 = 3 people. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters per week.
So, the total number of letters Mike receives per week is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ letters} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of pages Mike needs to write in response.**

Each letter is 5 pages long, so for 6 letters, the total number of pages Mike needs to write is:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ pages} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time Mike spends writing in minutes.**

Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, so for 30 pages, the total time he spends writing is:
\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time in hours is:

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her french fries, and then Colby took 3 less than what Kyle took. If at the end Griffin had 27 pieces of french fries, how many pieces of french fries did Ginger give to Griffin?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of french fries Griffin had after each action and then find out how many pieces Ginger gave him.

1. Initially, Griffin had 24 pieces of french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 pieces, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) pieces left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pieces, and Griffin had \(19 - 10 = 9\) pieces left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of pieces Ginger gave Griffin. After Ginger gave him \(x\) pieces, Griffin had \(9 + x\) pieces.
5. Colby took 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) pieces, and Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) pieces left.
6. We know that at the end Griffin had 27 pieces, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

The difference in the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. If there is the same number of fish in both aquariums, how many fish are in each aquarium?

To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of fish in each aquarium as \( x \). Since the number of fish is the same in both aquariums, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2x \).

The difference in the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \). According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2x \]
\[ 28 = 4x \]
To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

To finish the film, it takes 5 weeks. At the end of the filming, the makeup artist gives Jin a 10% discount for the amount of work done. How much did Jin pay?

Answer:
First, calculate the total number of hours of makeup application per week:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, calculate the total number of hours of makeup application for the entire 5 weeks:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there is a 10% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount paid:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cookies each person ate and then calculate the total calories consumed by each.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.
So, the total number of cookies her sister ate is:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \]

Next, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times more cookies than her sister. So, she ate:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, she ate:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \]
So, the total number of cookies Sue ate is:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \]

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Each cookie has 200 calories.
- The total calories consumed by Sue's sister is:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \]
- The total calories consumed by Sue is:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \]

To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The value of the house increased by 150%, so the new value is the original purchase price plus 150% of the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is 80,000 dollars. An increase of 150% of 80,000 dollars is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost of the house, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:

""In Toulouse, there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston. In Charleston, there are four times as many sheep as in Seattle. How many sheep are there in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle combined if there are 20 sheep in Seattle?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of sheep in Seattle be \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).
2. The number of sheep in Charleston is four times the number of sheep in Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \( 4S \). Substituting \( S = 20 \), we get:
   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. The number of sheep in Toulouse is twice the number of sheep in Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \( 2 \times \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} \). Substituting the number of sheep in Charleston, we get:
   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle combined. This is the sum of the number of sheep in each city:
   \[
   \text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} + \text{Number of sheep in Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle combined is \(\boxed{260}\).",260,260
polymath-low-ru-7,"Translation: Carla is uploading a file that is 200 GB in size. Usually, she can upload 2 GB per minute, but when 40% of the upload is complete, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. After that, Carla has to restart the upload from the beginning. How long does the file upload take in total?

To solve this, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the total time step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   \[
   200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB}
   \]
   So, 80 GB is 40% of the file.

2. **Calculate the time to upload 80 GB:**
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, it takes 40 minutes to upload 80 GB.

3. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   \[
   40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, the total time for the first 40% of the upload and the restart is 60 minutes.

4. **Calculate the remaining 60% of the file:**
   \[
   200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}
   \]
   So, 120 GB is the remaining 60% of the file.

5. **Calculate the time to upload the remaining 120 GB:**
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, it takes 60 minutes to upload the remaining 120 GB.

6. **Add the time for the second upload:**
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   So, the total time for the second upload is 60 minutes.

7. **Add the total time for both parts:**
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}

""John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home. He tries to get home in 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in traffic. For the next half hour, he drives at 30 miles per hour, and then can drive the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour. How far is he from home after these 4 hours?""

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered = \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles/hour} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Turning Around:**
   - John turns around and now needs to return home.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - He spends the first 2 hours in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.
   - After traffic, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in 0.5 hours = \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 15 \text{ miles}\).
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and he has already spent 2.5 hours) at 80 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in 1.5 hours = \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ miles/hour} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered = \(15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles}\).

5. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initially, he was 180 miles away from home.
   - After the return trip, he has covered 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining = \(180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, the distance from home after 4 hours is \(\boxed{45}\) miles.",45,45

To determine how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break down her earnings into regular and overtime pay.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   \[
   40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400
   \]

2. Calculate the number of overtime hours worked:

The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month, but then it decreased by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have in total over the three months?

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month. First, we calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads:**
   Now, we sum the downloads from all three months:

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of baked good separately and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the cost of the doughnuts:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozens} \times 68 \text{ dollars per dozen} = 3 \times 68 = 204 \text{ dollars}

Watering and fertilizing the tree costs $3 per year. How many years will it take before he starts making a profit from the lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find out when the total net profit will be positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
\[ \$3/\text{year} \]

The net profit each year is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7/\text{year} \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:
\[ \text{Initial cost} = \$90 \]
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = \$7 \]

The number of years required to cover the initial cost is:
\[ \frac{90}{7} \approx 12.857 \]

Since Carlos can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take 13 years for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house, so she sold \(\frac{x}{3}\) vacuum cleaners to the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left to the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold to the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18

First, we calculate the number of students who signed up for modern dances. Since 20% of the 20 students signed up for modern dances, we have:
\[ 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we determine how many students are left after the 4 students who signed up for modern dances:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Then, we calculate how many of the remaining 16 students signed up for jazz dances. Since 25% of the remaining students signed up for jazz dances, we have:
\[ 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we find out how many students are left to sign up for hip-hop dances. Since 4 students signed up for modern dances and 4 students signed up for jazz dances, the number of students who signed up for hip-hop dances is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of all students who signed up for hip-hop dances, we use the formula for percentage:

His financial consultant assumes that the jewelry market will grow by 2.5% and the electronic gadgets market will grow by 1.2% in the same month. If the merchant, when making a choice, wants to maximize profit at the end of the month, what will this profit be?

To determine which option will maximize the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the profit for each option based on the given growth rates.

1. **Jewelry Option:**
   - Initial value: $5000
   - Growth rate: 2.5%
   - Value at the end of the month: \(5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125\)

To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both her teaching and cheerleading coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours per week.
- She works 50 weeks per year.
- She is paid $20 per hour.

The total hours she works in a year from teaching is:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 1750 \text{ hours/year} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 1750 \text{ hours/year} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 35000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from cheerleading coaching:
- She works 15 hours per week.
- She works 50 weeks per year.
- She is paid $30 per hour.

The total hours she works in a year from cheerleading coaching is:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 750 \text{ hours/year} \]

Her annual earnings from cheerleading coaching are:

To find the speed at which Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to determine the total time she has to complete the 12-mile route to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

Given that the total distance is 12 miles and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time required:

\[
4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}} \implies \text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and 1 hour on the next 2 miles, which totals 2 hours. Therefore, the remaining time she has to cover the remaining 6 miles is:

\[
3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour}

polymath-low-ru-26,"Translation: Mike bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $16.50, one pair of pants costs $22.50, and one pair of shoes costs $42. How many dollars did Mike spend on all the clothing items?

To determine how much Mike spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the shorts:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pants:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the shoes:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount spent:
\[
\$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Mike spent on all the clothing items is \(\boxed{243}\).",243,243
polymath-low-ru-27,"Translation: Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every evening. She buys boxes of ice cream with 15 portions of ice cream per box at a price of $4.00 per box. How much will she spend on ice cream after 60 days?

To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many boxes of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every evening, so in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ portions} \]

Step 2: Determine how many boxes of ice cream she will need to buy.
Each box contains 15 portions of ice cream. To find out how many boxes she needs, we divide the total number of portions by the number of portions per box:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ portions}}{15 \text{ portions/box}} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.
Each box costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 boxes is:
\[ 4 \text{ boxes} \times 4 \text{ dollars/box} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16
polymath-low-ru-28,"Translation: During a 60-mile bike ride, Henry made two stops. The first stop was after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the ride. How many miles did he ride between his first and second stops?

To find out how many miles Henry rode between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two stops. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the total distance of the ride: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance at which the first stop was made: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance at which the second stop was made: 15 miles before the end of the ride, which means it was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.
4. Calculate the distance between the first and second stops: \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

So, the number of miles Henry rode between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
polymath-low-ru-29,"Translation: Gloria goes shopping in shoe stores and finds a pair of shoes that fit her budget for shoes. However, she has to choose between these shoes and two pairs of high-heeled shoes, which together cost five dollars less than the shoes. If one pair of high-heeled shoes costs 33 dollars and the other pair costs twice as much, how much do the shoes cost?

Let's denote the cost of the shoes as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes together is five dollars less than the cost of the shoes. The cost of the first pair of high-heeled shoes is 33 dollars, and the cost of the second pair is twice that, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. This can be expressed as:

\[ x - 5 = 99 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 99 + 5 \]
\[ x = 104 \]

So, the cost of the shoes is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars.",104,104
polymath-low-ru-30,"Translation: Darren and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. If their combined current age is 162, calculate Allen's age in 10 years.

To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darren and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darren's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). According to the problem, their combined age is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-ru-31,"Translation: Gunter is trying to count the candies in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One friend says 80. Another friend says it is 20 more than half of what the first friend said. The third friend says it is 25% more than what the first friend said. What is their average guess?

To find the average guess, we need to determine the guesses of each friend and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend's guess is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so the third friend's guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
