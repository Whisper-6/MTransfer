mgsm-en-47,"First, we determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]
Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]
The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = \frac{3 \times 120}{4} = \frac{360}{4} = 90
\]

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[
120 - 90 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs per week.

First, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily production by 7:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly egg production into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week.",294,294

mgsm-en-53,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Friday is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Since no truck tires are repaired on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Friday is \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- The revenue on Thursday is $520.
- The revenue on Friday is $480.
- The difference in revenue is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday.",40,40

2. Determine the number of unripe oranges.
3. Determine the number of sour oranges.
4. Subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.

Let's start with the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Total number of oranges} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe:
\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

We are given that there is 1 bad orange:
\[ \text{Number of bad oranges} = 1 \]

We are also given that there are 2 sour oranges:
\[ \text{Number of sour oranges} = 2 \]

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (\text{Number of bad oranges} + \text{Number of unripe oranges} + \text{Number of sour oranges}) \]

mgsm-en-75,"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

We can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:
- Level 4: \(16\) square feet
- Level 3: \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\) square feet
- Level 2: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) square feet
- Level 1: \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) square feet

Next, we find the total square footage of all four levels:
\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60
mgsm-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bags of dog food this amount corresponds to. Since each bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot use a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is \(\boxed{2}\).",2,5
mgsm-en-77,"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we start by defining the amount of laundry each person does in terms of David's laundry.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does is:
\[
S = 4D
\]

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:
\[
S = 400
\]

Substituting the value of \( S \) into the equation \( S = 4D \), we get:
\[
400 = 4D
\]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
\]

Next, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, the amount of laundry Raymond does is:
\[
R = \frac{S}{2}
\]

Substituting the value of \( S \) into the equation \( R = \frac{S}{2} \), we get:
\[
R = \frac{400}{2} = 200
\]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[
R - D = 200 - 100 = 100
\]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[
\boxed{100}

First, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers if Vincent buys them in packages of 3 for $2.50:
- Each package contains 3 flowers.
- To find out how many packages are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Each package costs $2.50, so the total cost for 6 packages is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers if Vincent buys them in packages of 2 for $1:
- Each package contains 2 flowers.
- To find out how many packages are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Each package costs $1, so the total cost for 9 packages is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9
  \]

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
\[

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on the given relationship.
3. Add Grace's and Alex's weights together.

First, we know that Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
Substituting Grace's weight into the equation, we get:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together to find their combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

mgsm-en-84,"Let's denote the number of games the football team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[ W = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games the team won is \( \boxed{15} \).",15,15

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat. Since each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad and there are 20 adults, we multiply the amount each adult eats by the number of adults:
\[
10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat. Since each child will eat half as much as an adult, each child will eat:

   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Account for the Windows restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - Time to download 120 GB is \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Time to download the first 80 GB: 40 minutes.
   - Time for the Windows restart: 20 minutes.
   - Time to download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes.
   - Total time is \(40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}\).

mgsm-en-8,"First, we calculate the distance John travels in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we determine the distance John covers during his return trip. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[
\text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
\]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time for the return trip is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph). Therefore, the remaining time is:
\[
4 \, \text{hours} - 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}
\]
The distance covered during this remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph is:
\[
\text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Adding up all the distances covered during the return trip:
\[
15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, we calculate the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours. He initially drove 180 miles away from home and then returned 135 miles. The remaining distance from home is:
\[
180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

mgsm-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost:**
   The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Growth and Revenue:**
   Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]

3. **Annual Costs:**
   The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual costs:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point:**
   To find the number of years it takes to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the total net profit to equal the initial cost of $90. Let \( n \) be the number of years. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
   \[

mgsm-en-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house sale is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house sale is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \]

We can simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 1 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners.",18,18

3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

First, since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons required is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16
mgsm-en-28,"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip.
2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop.
3. Determine the distance traveled after the second stop.
4. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry first stopped after 20 miles. This means he traveled 20 miles before his first stop. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, 15 miles before the end is \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles. This means he traveled 45 miles before his second stop.

To find the distance traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance traveled before the first stop from the distance traveled before the second stop:
\[45 - 20 = 25\]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25
mgsm-en-29,"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know the cost of one pair of high heels is $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[
33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
\]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
99 = B - 5
\]

To find \( B \), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[
B = 99 + 5 = 104
\]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars.",104,104
mgsm-en-30,"Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]
This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that the sum of their current ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \), we get:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Now, divide both sides by 18:
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
mgsm-en-31,"To determine the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses of each friend.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's denote the guesses:
- The first friend's guess is \(80\).
- The second friend's guess is \(20\) more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of \(80\) and then add \(20\):
  \[
  \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend's guess is \(25\%\) more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate \(25\%\) of \(80\) and then add it to \(80\):
  \[
  \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
  \]

Now, we have the guesses: \(80\), \(60\), and \(100\). To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
mgsm-en-32,"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog.
2. Multiply the daily time by the number of dogs to find the total daily time.
3. Multiply the total daily time by the number of days in a week to find the total weekly time.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John has 10 dogs, the total time spent per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on the dogs in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total time spent in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\).",35,35
mgsm-en-33,"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We can express these conditions with the following equations:

\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:

\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,70
mgsm-en-34,"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

First, we calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we calculate the total cost:

Next, we determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. Therefore, the amount of money he spent on the video games and the remaining money can be used to find out how much he initially had:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
Since he has $5 left after buying the video games, we can confirm that:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]
But we already calculated that he spent $160 and had $5 left, which is consistent with the initial $195.

First, we know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. Let's denote the number of articles she wrote on Monday as \( A_{\text{Monday}} = 5 \).

Next, we calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. According to the problem, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is \( A_{\text{Tuesday}} = 7 \).

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \). So, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is \( A_{\text{Wednesday}} = 14 \).

Now, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{Monday}} + A_{\text{Tuesday}} + A_{\text{Wednesday}} = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons Violetta wants to buy.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money she has prepared.

First, we calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs 5 different colors of crayons, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has prepared. She has $20, so the change she will get is:

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40

1. Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
2. Calculate the payment from each publisher.
3. Sum the payments to find the total amount Mark makes in a week.

First, since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, the payment is:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]
For 500 sentences, the payment is:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the payments from both publishers to find the total amount Mark makes in a week:
\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time. So, the total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara also earns money from mowing the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her earnings from mowing the lawn are:

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the smallest value for \( x \) is 10. Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.",10,10

3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. So, the number of customers on the first day is:
\[ \text{Customers on the first day} = 100 \]

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:

mgsm-en-214,"Let's denote the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons and the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. Since both pools have leaks emptying them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons for the big pool and \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons for the small pool.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. To verify, we can find the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]
Four minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons. Indeed, 48 is twice 24, which confirms our solution is correct.

Thus, the amount of water in the small pool now is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,8

2. Calculate the number of dahlias in the vase.
3. Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Step 1: Identify the number of roses.
The problem states that there are 4 roses in the vase.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dahlias.
The problem also states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Since there are 4 roses, the number of dahlias is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.
The total number of flowers is the sum of the roses and the dahlias:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

mgsm-en-218,"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

First, we know Harriet's current age is 21 years. According to the problem, Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, we can find Zack's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42
\]

Next, we know that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, we can find Adrian's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63
\]

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. Adding 3 years to each of their current ages, we get:
\[
\text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66
\]
\[
\text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45
\]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45
mgsm-en-219,"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points each of the other three students scored. Let's start with Naomi's score, which is given as 68 points.

Next, we calculate Yuri's score. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we first find half of Naomi's score:
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34
\]
Then, we add 10 to this value:
\[
34 + 10 = 44
\]
So, Yuri scored 44 points.

Now, we calculate Brianna's score. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's score:
\[
68 + 17 = 85
\]
So, Brianna scored 85 points.

Now we know the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the sum of the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, we first find the sum of the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]
Then, we subtract this sum from the total points:
\[
251 - 197 = 54

- **Grass type**: James originally has 20 grass type cards and buys 14 more, so he now has:
  \[
  20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards}
  \]
- **Water type**: James originally has 40 water type cards and loses 8, so he now has:
  \[

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has:
\[
30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ cards}
\]

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type card. This is given by the ratio of the number of water type cards to the total number of cards:
\[
\frac{32}{96}
\]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{32}{96} \times 100 = \frac{32 \times 100}{96} = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.3333

2. Determine the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the ready ones home.
3. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Determine the number of watermelons remaining after the second harvest.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months.**

The farm produced 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest.
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

**Step 2: Determine the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the ready ones home.**

Subtract the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest from the total number of watermelons.
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons remained after Ashlyn took the ready ones home.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two weeks.**

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

**Step 4: Determine the number of watermelons remaining after the second harvest.**

Subtract the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two weeks from the remaining watermelons.
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to find the subtotal before registration fees:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the total registration fee. Since the registration fee is $1000 per car and there are 12 cars, the total registration fee is:
\[ 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration fee to the subtotal to find the total amount Mark pays:

- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:

2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the number of pineapples per hectare that can be harvested in one harvest is 100.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to determine how many times he can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[
\frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}

mgsm-en-150,"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home from school.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: \(3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Speed: \(440 \text{ feet per minute}\)
- Time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

For Tim:
- Distance: \(2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet}\)
- Speed: \(264 \text{ feet per minute}\)
- Time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner and he takes 36 minutes, and Tim takes 40 minutes, the difference in their times is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes.",4,4
mgsm-en-151,"First, we need to determine the total number of tires that were inflated. Shawnda charges by the tire, so we need to count the tires for each type of vehicle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - On the first day, 5 people came by with bicycles.
   - Total tires for bicycles: \( 5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires} \).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - On the first day, 3 people came by with tricycles.
   - Total tires for tricycles: \( 3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires} \).

3. **Unicycles:**
   - Each unicycle has 1 tire.
   - On the first day, 1 person came by with a unicycle.
   - Total tires for unicycles: \( 1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire} \).

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[
10 \text{ tires (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ tires (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ tire (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire. To find the total amount of money she made, we multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars per tire} = 5 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-en-153,"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the number of fries left is \( x - 14 \).
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the number of fries left after the seagull ate is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The number of fries left after the pigeons ate is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so the number of fries left after the raccoon ate is \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = \frac{x - 30}{3} \).
5. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, the number of fries left after the ants ate is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

We can now solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:

Add 30 to both sides:
\[
x = 48

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours for these three days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/day} = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours for these two days is:

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
\[
120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
\]

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
\[
60 \text{ baguettes} \times 2 \text{ feet/baguette} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we need to convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 100 \text{ feet}

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. The distance for one round trip is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
Since Blake runs this distance 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once on the entire length of the field and then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for one round trip on the entire field is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
The distance for one trip to the 40-yard line and back is:
\[ 40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards} \]
Since Kelly runs the entire field distance once and the 40-yard line distance 34 times, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards} + 80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances run by Blake and Kelly:

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the original price of the bag of marbles.
2. Determine the number of times the price increases in 36 months.
3. Calculate the new price after each increase.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% every two months. Since there are 36 months in total, the price will increase 18 times (36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases).

The price after each increase can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( P \) is the final price, \( P_0 \) is the original price, \( r \) is the rate of increase, and \( n \) is the number of increases.

Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ P = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:
\[ P = 20 \times 39.366 = 787.32 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]",32,92

3. The action figure costs $5.

First, let's find the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and each action figure costs $5, we can calculate the cost of the doll as follows:
\[
\text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we know the cost of one red car is $4. The problem states there are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is:
\[
\text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

The cost of one action figure is $5, and there are 3 action figures, so the total cost of the action figures is:
\[
\text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total value of all the toys by summing the costs of the red cars, the action figures, and the doll:

mgsm-en-173,"First, we calculate the total minimum monthly payment for all Jessica's debts:

\[
300 \text{ (student loans)} + 200 \text{ (credit card)} + 500 \text{ (mortgage)} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine how much Jessica wants to pay each month by increasing the minimum payment by 50%. We do this by calculating 50% of the minimum payment and adding it to the minimum payment:

\[
50\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.5 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Jessica wants to pay $1500 each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

\[
1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Jessica pays in a year is \(\boxed{18000}\).",18000,18000
mgsm-en-174,"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time spent peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply by the number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all the potatoes.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling all the potatoes.**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for cutting all the potatoes.**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds} \)

**Step 3: Convert the total cutting time from seconds to minutes.**
- 300 seconds = \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 4: Add the total peeling time and the total cutting time.**
- Total time to peel = 90 minutes
- Total time to cut = 5 minutes
- Total prep time = \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \)

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is \(\boxed{95}\) minutes.",95,95

2. Use Bo's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Monic has.
3. Use Monic's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). So, \( B = 40 \).

Next, we need to find out how many crabs Monic has. According to the problem, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = B - 4 \]
Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. The problem states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = M + 10 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team. Each of the four runners runs the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the faster team is:
\[
55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team. The first runner runs the 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for the four runners are:

mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll, so the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of rolling an even number on each roll:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

First, let's calculate the total amount of straw given to the hamsters. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages of hamsters, with each cage containing one hamster. Therefore, the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is:
\[ 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces/hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that the total amount of straw distributed among all the rodents is 160 pieces. Therefore, the amount of straw given to the rats and the rabbits is:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} = 110 \text{ pieces} \]

The rabbits receive a total of 20 pieces of straw. Therefore, the amount of straw given to the rats is:
\[ 110 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. Then the total number of rats is \( 3r \), and the total amount of straw given to the rats is:
\[ 3r \times 6 = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

We know that the total amount of straw given to the rats is 90 pieces, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 18r = 90 \]

4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

Let's start with step 1. The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Next, for step 2, we need to find the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

For step 3, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Finally, for step 4, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout:

mgsm-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate his water consumption on weekdays:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed.
- This means he drinks 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.

So, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate his water consumption on weekends:
- On weekends, John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but he has a soda before bed instead of water.
- This means he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekends.
- There are 2 days in a weekend.

So, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we sum the water consumption from weekdays and weekends to get the total for the week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The inner volume \( V \) of a box is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72
mgsm-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and break down the hours for each day.

First, let's summarize the hours of TV watched each day:
- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- **Friday**: 2 hours

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday as \( x \). Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \( 0.5x \) hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV over the week is given as 7 hours. We can set up the following equation to represent the total time:

\[
1 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3
\]

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.",30,3

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50

1. **Calculate the total distance to the shore:**
   Julia took 64 seconds to reach the shore. Given that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the total distance by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{x \text{ feet}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   16x = 64 \times 20
   \]
   \[
   16x = 1280
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1280}{16}

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   Since the boat is 80 feet from the shore, the total amount of water taken on is:
   \[
   80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters.",16,16

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. The problem also states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 300 = 50D \]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 50:

\[ 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards was $16 each, and she has five of them. Therefore, the total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the current price of the lumber. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the current price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars each} \]
So, the total current price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

The current price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars each} \]
So, the total current price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:

Adding these together, the total current price of the lumber Sasha is selling is:
\[ 150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit Sasha makes is the difference between the total current price and the total original cost:

First, we know that on the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ 40000 = L + 0.4L = 1.4L \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.4} = \frac{400000}{14} = 28571.43 \]
So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $28,571.43.

Next, we need to find Adrien's current salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it increased by 40% over the past four years. Therefore, Adrien's current salary is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. We know that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. Therefore, Lylah's current salary is:

mgsm-en-129,"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate both the revenue and the cost for the hospital, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors with the patients in a day:
\[
500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes per patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes}
\]
Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[
12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:
\[
200 \text{ hours} \times \$150 \text{ per hour} = \$30000
\]

Now, we calculate the revenue from the patients:
\[
500 \text{ patients} \times \$200 \text{ per hour} = \$100000
\]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue:

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the students.

First, let's find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes each day on the weekdays (Monday through Friday), and 8 classes on Saturday. There are 5 weekdays, so the number of classes on weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]
Adding the classes on Saturday:
\[ 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is:
\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from the students. Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total revenue is:
\[ 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:

1. Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest charged.
3. Determine the total amount to be paid.
4. Calculate the monthly payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest.**

The cost of one cell phone is $150. Therefore, the cost of five cell phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total interest charged.**

A 2% interest is charged on each cell phone. Therefore, the interest on one cell phone is:

polymath-low-en-77,"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we start by defining the amount of laundry each person does in terms of David's laundry.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does is:
\[
4D
\]

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
4D = 400
\]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
\]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, the amount of laundry Raymond does is:
\[
\frac{400}{2} = 200

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

polymath-low-en-96,"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by calculating how many hours James slept. We know that James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. Since Harry slept 9 hours, we can find out how many hours James slept by multiplying 9 by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 9 \times 0.6667 = 6
\]

So, James slept 6 hours. Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference in hours} = 9 - 6 = 3

polymath-low-en-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes used.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes used, the volume of the tomatoes used is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. Therefore, the number of cans used is:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{12}\).",12,12
polymath-low-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have driven through, and then 5 cars take an exit. This means that after the first 15 minutes, there are \( 30 - x - 5 = 25 - x \) cars left on the motorway.

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam. So, the total number of cars that have driven through the traffic jam by the end of the 30 minutes is \( x + 20 \).

Since the only cars that are left on the motorway after the 30 minutes are the ones that didn't drive through in the first 15 minutes and the ones that didn't take an exit, the number of cars left on the motorway is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 25 - x = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{25} \).",25,5

polymath-low-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- He also has a glass of water before bed.
- Therefore, on a weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- He does not have a glass of water before bed on the weekend.
- Therefore, on a weekend day, John drinks \(3\) glasses of water.

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we sum the glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the week:

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions are reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   Therefore, the inner dimensions are:
   - Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:

- On Monday, Frankie watched 1 hour.
- On Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour.
- On Thursday, Frankie watched 1 hour and 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours).
- On Friday, Frankie watched 2 hours.
- Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. Therefore, he watched \( x \times 0.5 \) hours on Wednesday.

The total time spent watching TV is the sum of the time spent each day:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7 \]
\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 0.5x = 7 - 5.5 \]
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]
\[ x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110

\[
10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} + 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Next, we need to find out the current price of the lumber. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price is:

\[
\text{Original price} \times 1.5 = \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per 2 x 4 x 10 board}
\]
\[
\text{Original price} \times 1.5 = \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per 4 x 4 x 10 board}

4. Determine Lylah's salary four years later.
5. Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. According to the problem, Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.**

Adrien's salary four years ago was given as $40000.

**Step 3: Determine Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later was 40% more than his salary four years ago. Therefore, his salary four years later is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

**Step 4: Determine Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later is 40% more than her salary four years ago. Therefore, her salary four years later is:
\[ \frac{40000}{1.3} \times 1.4 = \frac{40000 \times 1.4}{1.3} = \frac{56000}{1.3} = 43076.92 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later.**

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}

mgsm-en-242,"First, we determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. The time it takes for Mike to write one page is 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in a week is:
\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries} \]

So, after Billy took his fries, Griffin had:

\[ 19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries} \]

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \( x \). After receiving \( x \) fries from Ginger, Griffin had:

\[ 9 + x \text{ fries} \]

Colby then took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries} \]

So, after Colby took his fries, Griffin had:

\[ 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries} \]

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 7 + x = 27 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 27 - 7 = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries.",20,20

polymath-low-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then find the remaining distance to his home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around:
\[ \text{Distance to turn around} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance John travels back towards home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not cover any distance during this time. Then he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance covered in 0.5 hours} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time he has for driving is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2 hours in standstill traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph, so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance covered in 1.5 hours} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances John has traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John initially traveled 180 miles to the point where he turned around, and he has traveled 135 miles back towards home, the remaining distance from home is:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is \(\boxed{45}\) miles.",45,45

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's define the variables and the annual costs and revenues:
- Initial cost to plant the tree: $90
- Cost to water and feed the tree each year: $3
- Number of lemons grown each year: 7
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5

The net profit each year can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = (\text{Number of lemons} \times \text{Selling price per lemon}) - \text{Annual cost} \]
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = (7 \times 1.5) - 3 = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \]

Now, we need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the total net profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree:
\[ \text{Total net profit after } n \text{ years} = n \times 7.5 \]
We need this to be at least $90:
\[ n \times 7.5 \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final answer is:

First, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 1 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners.",18,18

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \).",104,104
polymath-low-en-30,"Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-en-31,"To determine the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the guesses:**
   - The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
   - The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
   - The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess.

2. **Calculate the second friend's guess:**
   - Half of the first friend's guess: \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\)
   - 20 more than half: \(40 + 20 = 60\)

3. **Calculate the third friend's guess:**
   - 25% more than the first friend's guess: \(80 \times 0.25 = 20\)
   - Adding 20 to the original guess: \(80 + 20 = 100\)

4. **List all the guesses:**
   - First friend: 80
   - Second friend: 60
   - Third friend: 100

5. **Calculate the sum of the guesses:**
   \[
   80 + 60 + 100 = 240
   \]

6. **Calculate the average guess:**
   - Number of friends: 3
   - Average: \(\frac{240}{3} = 80\)

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
