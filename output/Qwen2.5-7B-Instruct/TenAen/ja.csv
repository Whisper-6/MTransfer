mgsm-ja-47,"Translation: John buys twice the number of red ties as the blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total?

To solve the problem, we first determine the number of blue ties John bought:
\[ \text{Cost of one blue tie} = \$40 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for blue ties} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the number of red ties John bought:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we find the cost of one red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties:
\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for the red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we find the total amount spent on ties:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is $\boxed{800}$.",800,800
mgsm-ja-48,"Translation: Tracy used a 4-foot long wire in her garden to support tomato plants. The wire is now divided into pieces that are 6 inches long each. How many wires did she get?

To solve this, we first need to convert the measurements to the same unit. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a 4-foot wire is equivalent to 48 inches. If each piece is 6 inches long, we can find the number of pieces by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.

So, we perform the division: \( 48 \div 6 = 8 \).

Thus, Tracy got \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire.",8,8
mgsm-ja-49,"Translation: Richard lives in a 15-story apartment building. Each floor has 8 rooms, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. How many unoccupied rooms are there in the building?

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of rooms in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 rooms, the total number of rooms is:

\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to determine how many rooms are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied rooms is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

The number of unoccupied rooms is the total number of rooms minus the number of occupied rooms:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied rooms is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-ja-50,"Translation: Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and sell them at $2 per dozen. How much can Lloyd earn from eggs in a week?

To calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings from eggs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings based on the price per dozen.

Step 1: Calculate the weekly egg production.
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly egg production is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 2: Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the weekly egg production in dozens is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings.
Lloyd sells the eggs at $2 per dozen, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 147 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd can earn \(\boxed{294}\) dollars in a week.",294,294

mgsm-ja-52,"Translation: Yuraiya's bag for his books has become too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from the bottom. His comic books each weigh 1/4 pound, and his toys each weigh 1/2 pound. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Yuraiya removes:

\[ 30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound per comic book} = \frac{30}{4} \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

After removing 30 comic books, Yuraiya still needs to remove an additional 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we calculate the number of toys he needs to remove:

\[ \frac{7.5 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, the number of toys Yuraiya needs to remove is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15
mgsm-ja-53,"Translation: The mechanic charges different rates for repairing trucks and cars. For repairing each truck's tire, the mechanic charges $60, and for repairing each car's tire, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 tires but did not repair any truck tires. On which day did the mechanic earn more profit, and by how much?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total earnings for Thursday:
- For 6 truck tires: $60 × 6 = $360
- For 4 car tires: $40 × 4 = $160
- Total for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, we calculate the total earnings for Friday:
- Since no truck tires were repaired, only car tires were repaired.
- For 12 car tires: $40 × 12 = $480

Comparing the earnings:
- Thursday: $520
- Friday: $480

The mechanic earned more on Thursday. The difference in earnings between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

mgsm-ja-57,"Translation: The wooden bridge cannot withstand a weight over 5000 pounds. Each delivery truck is loaded with 33 boxes of the same weight, each weighing 15 pounds, and the driver and an empty truck weigh a total of 3755 pounds. Without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, what is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck?
To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the truck and the driver.
2. Subtract this weight from the bridge's weight limit to find the maximum weight that the boxes can have.
3. Determine how many boxes can be loaded based on the weight of each box.

First, let's find the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 15 pounds and there are 33 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is:
\[ 15 \text{ pounds/box} \times 33 \text{ boxes} = 495 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight is left for the boxes after accounting for the weight of the truck and the driver. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds, and the weight of the truck and the driver is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is:
\[ 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes can be loaded with the remaining 1245 pounds. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 83 \right\rfloor = 83 \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

mgsm-ja-61,"Translation: Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. She pays $500 for the materials and then pays $800 to a jeweler to make it. After that, she insures it for 10%. How much did she pay in total?

To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the materials, the cost to have the brooch made, and the cost of the insurance.

1. The cost of the materials is $500.
2. The cost to have the brooch made is $800.
3. The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the materials and the made brooch. First, we calculate the total cost of the materials and the made brooch:
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]
   Then, we calculate 10% of $1300:
   \[
   1300 \times 0.10 = 130
   \]

Now, we add the cost of the materials, the cost to have the brooch made, and the insurance cost:
\[
500 + 800 + 130 = 1430

mgsm-ja-62,"Translation: If Marcy works at the same company for 40 years, she will receive a pension of $50,000 per year. 20 years later, she will be able to receive an annuity of 5% per year. If Marcy stops working after 30 years, how much will her pension be per year?

To solve this, we need to calculate the annuity amount after 20 years, given that Marcy will stop working after 30 years. Since the annuity starts 20 years after she starts working, she will receive the annuity for 10 years (from year 30 to year 40).

The initial pension amount is $50,000 per year. The annuity rate is 5% per year. Therefore, after 20 years, the pension amount will be:

\[ 50,000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{20} \]

First, we calculate \(1.05^{20}\):

\[ 1.05^{20} \approx 2.6533 \]

Then, we multiply this by the initial pension amount:

\[ 50,000 \times 2.6533 = 132,665 \]

So, if Marcy stops working after 30 years, her pension will be:

\[ \boxed{132665} \]",132665,25000

For the second half of the year, the streaming service offers a 10% discount. Calculate how much Arena pays for the streaming service by the end of the year.

To calculate the total amount Arena pays for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The cost per month is $140.
   - Total cost for the first half of the year: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The streaming service offers a 10% discount.
   - The discounted cost per month: \( 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for the year:**
   - Adding the costs from both halves of the year: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

Since she last filled up her tank, she has driven 100 miles and needs to put in 4 gallons to refill. The owner's manual states that the tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sofia drive on one tank of gas?

To find out how many miles Sofia can drive on one tank of gas, we need to determine her car's fuel efficiency. We know that after driving 100 miles, she needs to add 4 gallons to refill the tank, and the tank can hold a total of 12 gallons.

First, we calculate the amount of gas used to drive 100 miles:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons (full tank)} - 4 \text{ gallons (added to refill)} = 8 \text{ gallons (used to drive 100 miles)} \]

Next, we find the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon:
\[ \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{8 \text{ gallons}} = 12.5 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we calculate how many miles Sofia can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:
\[ \text{Miles per tank} = 12.5 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 150 \text{ miles} \]

To solve this, we start by determining the size of each level of the sand castle. Since each level is half the size of the level below it, we can work our way up from the bottom level.

Let's denote the size of the bottom level as \( x \). Then the sizes of the levels from bottom to top are:
- Bottom level: \( x \)
- Second level: \( \frac{x}{2} \)
- Third level: \( \frac{x}{4} \)
- Top level: \( \frac{x}{8} \)

We know the top level is 16 square feet, so:
\[ \frac{x}{8} = 16 \]
\[ x = 16 \times 8 = 128 \]

Now we can find the sizes of all the levels:
- Bottom level: 128 square feet
- Second level: \( \frac{128}{2} = 64 \) square feet
- Third level: \( \frac{64}{2} = 32 \) square feet
- Top level: 16 square feet

To find the average size of each level, we sum the sizes of all the levels and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average size of each level is \( \boxed{60} \) square feet.",60,60
mgsm-ja-76,"Translation: Cecilia just bought a new puppy. According to her vet, for the first 180 days, she needs to give the puppy 1 cup of dog food daily. After that, for the rest of the dog's life, she needs to give 2 cups of dog food daily. If a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia need for the first year?

To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then determine how many bags that amount corresponds to.

First, calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required for 180 cups. Since each bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first year.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine how much laundry Sara washed:
   \[
   \text{Sara washed} = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Determine how much laundry Raymond washed:
   \[
   \text{Raymond washed} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sara's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Determine how much laundry David washed:
   \[
   \text{David washed} = \text{Sara's laundry} = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{David's laundry} - \text{Raymond's laundry} = 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ pounds}

So, the difference in the amount of laundry washed by Raymond and David is \(\boxed{200}\).",200,100
mgsm-ja-78,"Translation: Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or 2 for $1. If he buys 18 flowers, how much cheaper is the more economical option?

To determine the more economical option, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both package types and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2 for $1:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars

To find the cost after the discount, we calculate 30% of $100 and subtract it from the original price.

First, calculate 30% of $100:
\[ 30\% \times 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

Next, subtract this amount from the original price:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the grooming cost after the discount is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,70
mgsm-ja-80,"Translation: Two girls each drank one-sixth of 24 liters of water. Then, a boy drank 6 liters of water. How much water is left?

Solution:
1. Each girl drank one-sixth of 24 liters, so the amount each girl drank is \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) liters.
2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they drank is \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) liters.
3. The boy drank 6 liters of water.

Starting with the initial number of stickers:
\[ 10 \]

Adding the stickers bought at the mall:
\[ 10 + 21 = 31 \]

Adding the stickers received on his birthday:
\[ 31 + 23 = 54 \]

Subtracting the stickers given to his sister:

mgsm-ja-84,"Translation: A soccer team played 22 matches. They won 8 more matches than they lost. How many matches did they win?

To solve this, let's denote the number of matches they lost as \( L \). Since they won 8 more matches than they lost, the number of matches they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of matches played is the sum of the matches won and lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 2L = 14 \]
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 7 \]
So, the number of matches they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more matches than they lost, the number of matches they won is:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of matches they won is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

If Sylvia entered her 5th year of employment in December last year, how much will her annual salary be after she has worked for 3 more years?

To solve this, we need to calculate the salary increase year by year for the next 3 years.

1. **Initial Salary**: $600 per month
2. **First Year (6th year)**: Increase by 10%
   \[
   600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ per month}
   \]
3. **Second Year (7th year)**: Increase by another 10%
   \[

To solve this, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend.
2. Determine the total number of gift bags needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend.
Since one-fourth of the attendees will not show up, three-fourths will attend. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of attendees} = 16 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Step 2: Determine the total number of gift bags needed.
Since each guest who attends needs 0.75 gift bags, we calculate:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.
Since each gift bag costs $2, we calculate:

If Ted wants everyone to have enough to eat and there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 children attending the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does he need to bring for the picnic?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
   - Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults = \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) pounds.

2. Marcella has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcella has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jean has three times the number of pets that Marcella has, so Jean has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we add the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets:

\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcella's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jean's pets)} = 28

1. Determine Cory's age.
2. Use Cory's age to find Amy's age.
3. Use Amy's age to find Jackson's age.

First, we know that James is 10 years old and Cory is 1 year younger than James:
\[ \text{Cory's age} = 10 - 1 = 9 \]

Next, we know that Cory is 2 years younger than Amy:
\[ \text{Amy's age} = 9 + 2 = 11 \]

To solve this, we first need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400 meters hurdles. Since Lee was 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's new time is 38 seconds, Gerald's original time was:

\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. If his speed improved by 10%, his time would decrease by 10% of his original time. So, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald's new time is:

To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the price increase.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair cost) from the new value of the house.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original purchase price of the house is 80,000 dollars, and it increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the house's value is now 250% of its original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred. He spent 80,000 dollars to buy the house and 50,000 dollars on repairs, so the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:

In the morning, she gives 15 cups to all the chickens. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. If Wendy has 20 chickens in total, how many cups of feed does she need to give in the evening?
To find out how many cups of feed Wendy needs to give in the evening, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon, and then subtract this from the total daily feed.

The total daily feed is 3 cups. The morning feed is 15 cups, and the afternoon feed is 25 cups. However, since the total daily feed is 3 cups per chicken, we can calculate the evening feed as follows:

Total daily feed for 20 chickens = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.
Morning feed = 15 cups.
Afternoon feed = 25 cups.
Evening feed = Total daily feed - (Morning feed + Afternoon feed) = 60 cups - (15 cups + 25 cups) = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

So, the amount of feed Wendy needs to give in the evening is \boxed{20}.",20,20

To solve this, we start with the number of sheep Seattle has, which is 20.

Since Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate the number of sheep Charleston has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we calculate the number of sheep Toulouse has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we add the number of sheep from Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep:
\[ \text{Total number of sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have is $\boxed{260}$.",260,260

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First month**: The number of downloads is 60.
2. **Second month**: The number of downloads is three times the first month, so:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
3. **Third month**: The number of downloads is 30% less than the second month. First, we calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   180 \times 0.30 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this from 180 to get the number of downloads in the third month:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366

mgsm-ja-12,"Translation: Carlos is trying to plant a lemon tree. The lemon tree costs $90 to plant. Each year, 7 lemons will grow, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. It costs $3 per year to water the tree and give it fertilizer. How many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost over time.

First, let's calculate the annual profit from the lemon tree:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- The cost to water and fertilize the tree each year is $3.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

The annual cost to maintain the tree is:
\[ \$3/\text{year} \]

So, the annual profit is:
\[ \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year} \]

Next, we need to determine how many years it will take for the profit to cover the initial cost of $90:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years to start making a profit from the lemon tree.",12,13

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold one third of the vacuum cleaners in the green house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the green house is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
2. After selling to the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).
3. Melanie then sold 2 vacuum cleaners in the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She then sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).
5. After selling to the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \).
6. According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: \( \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

1. Calculate the number of students studying contemporary dance:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]
   So, 4 students are studying contemporary dance.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after accounting for those studying contemporary dance:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of students studying jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining 16 students:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]
   So, 4 students are studying jazz dance.

4. Calculate the number of students remaining after accounting for those studying contemporary and jazz dance:
   \[

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20.

So, her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 35000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

To solve this, we first calculate the cost of the second pair of heels:
- The first pair of heels costs $33.
- The second pair of heels costs twice as much, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

Next, we know that the boots are $5 cheaper than the total cost of the two pairs of heels:
- The total cost of the two pairs of heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.

1. Points scored in the first 20 minutes: 4 points.
2. Points scored in the second 20 minutes: 25% more than the first 20 minutes. So, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. Total points scored:
   \[
   4 + 5 = 9
   \]

So, the total points scored by Mike is $\boxed{9}$.",9,9
mgsm-ja-36,"Translation: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently, the yogurts are on sale for $5 and there are 4 of them. How much will he spend on 30 days' worth of yogurts?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total cost of yogurts Terry will need for 30 days.

First, determine how many yogurts Terry needs for 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, since the yogurts are sold in packs of 4 for $5, we need to find out how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy to get 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \text{ packs} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 15 packs:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ dollars/pack} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Terry will spend $75 on 30 days' worth of yogurts. 

The final answer is $\boxed{75}$.",75,75
mgsm-ja-37,"Translation: John plans to sell all of his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets, which he will sell for $15 each. After buying 8 video games that cost $20 each, he has $5 left. How many Lego sets does he have now?

To solve this, we first calculate the total money John gets from selling his Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times \$20 \text{ per game} = \$160 \]

After buying the video games, the amount of money John has left is:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Since the problem states that he has $5 left, it implies that he did not sell all his Lego sets. We need to find out how many Lego sets he sold to have $35 left after buying the video games. Let's denote the number of Lego sets he sold as \( x \). The money from selling \( x \) Lego sets is:
\[ 15x \]

The money left after buying the video games is:
\[ 15x - 160 = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 15x = 165 \]
\[ x = 11 \]

So, John sold 11 Lego sets. Therefore, the number of Lego sets he has now is:
\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

mgsm-ja-38,"Translation: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half the time. What is his running speed?

To find John's running speed, we need to determine the distance he runs each day and then calculate his speed based on that information.

First, let's find out how far John runs on the first day:
- He runs for 3 hours on the first day.
- Let his speed be \( v \) miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is \( 3v \) miles.

Next, let's find out how far John runs on the other two days:
- He runs for half the time on these days, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- Therefore, the distance he runs on each of these two days is \( 1.5v \) miles.
- The total distance for these two days is \( 2 \times 1.5v = 3v \) miles.

Now, let's find the total distance John runs in a week:
- The total distance is the sum of the distances from all three days: \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.
- We know that the total distance is 60 miles, so we can set up the equation: \( 6v = 60 \).

Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

Therefore, John's running speed is \( \boxed{10} \) miles per hour.",10,10
mgsm-ja-39,"Translation: Dana can run 4 times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at half the speed of her running speed. If she skips at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many kilometers can she cover in 6 hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?

To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the distance she covers in the given time.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Skipping speed: 3 miles per hour.
   - Running speed: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles per hour.
   - Walking speed: \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance covered in each activity:**
   - Distance covered running: \(12 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 24 \text{ miles}\).
   - Distance covered walking: \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 24 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Calculate the total distance covered:**
   - Total distance: \(24 \text{ miles} + 24 \text{ miles} = 48 \text{ miles}\).

5. **Convert the total distance from miles to kilometers:**
   - 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers.
   - Total distance in kilometers: \(48 \times 1.60934 = 77.14872 \approx 77.15\) kilometers.

To find out how many pieces of pie the guests ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pie pieces baked.
2. Subtract the number of pie pieces left from the total number of pie pieces baked.

First, calculate the total number of pie pieces baked:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, subtract the number of pie pieces left from the total number of pie pieces baked:

mgsm-ja-43,"Translation: According to nutritional information, a bag of potato chips contains 250 calories per serving. Assuming your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, if you have already consumed 1800 calories, how many grams of a 300-gram bag of potato chips can you eat from a 5-serving bag?

To solve this, we first determine how many more calories you can consume. You have a daily goal of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories, so you can consume:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories, we need to find out how many grams of the 300-gram bag you can eat with 200 calories. The ratio of calories to grams in the bag is:

\[ \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ grams per calorie} \]

So, the amount of the bag you can eat with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times \frac{6}{5} \text{ grams per calorie} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the answer is:

To answer the question, we need to calculate Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles.

First, let's determine the cost to produce 20 candles:
- Since 1 pound of honey wax can make 10 candles, 20 candles require 2 pounds of honey wax.
- The cost for 2 pounds of honey wax and 2 pounds of wicks (since 1 pound of wicks is needed for 10 candles, 20 candles will require 2 pounds of wicks) is $10.00 per pound for both, so the total cost is $10.00 * 2 + $10.00 * 2 = $40.00.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:
- If each candle is sold for $2.00, then the total revenue from selling 20 candles is $2.00 * 20 = $40.00.

Finally, the net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Net profit = $40.00 (revenue) - $40.00 (cost) = $0.00.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate how many hours in total she spent writing articles over these three days.

To solve this, we first determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day:

- **Monday**: 5 articles
- **Tuesday**: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \) articles
- **Wednesday**: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) articles

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over these three days:

At work, she stuck one sticky note on each of 220 different coffee cups. If she had 23 sticky notes left, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?

To find out how many sticky notes were in the pack Candice bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of sticky notes Candice used.
2. Subtract the number of sticky notes she had left from the total number of sticky notes she started with plus the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought.

First, let's find out how many sticky notes Candice used. She started with 80 sticky notes, used 220 sticky notes on the coffee cups, and had 23 sticky notes left. So, the total number of sticky notes she used is:

\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Next, we know that the total number of sticky notes she had initially plus the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought equals the total number of sticky notes used. Therefore, the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags of wheat the merchant sold. Let's denote the number of bags of wheat sold by \( x \).

First, we calculate the total revenue from selling the wheat:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 30x \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying and transporting the wheat:
\[ \text{Total cost of buying} = 20x \]
\[ \text{Total cost of transporting} = 2x \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

If John earns $2,000 every week throughout the year and had received this award on the first day of the year, how much would John have earned in total for that year?

To solve this, we need to calculate John's total earnings for the year, including the one-time payment and the increased salary.

1. Calculate the total salary for the year without the bonus:
   - John earns $2,000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his total salary for the year without the bonus is $2,000 * 52 = $104,000.

For the rest of the week, he ate macaroni and cheese, using 8 slices of cheese for each serving. How many slices of cheese did he use in total for the week?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of cheese used for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Lunch (Sandwiches):**
   - Number of days: 7
   - Cheese per sandwich: 2 slices
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) slices

2. **Breakfast (Cheese Omelets):**
   - Number of days: 3
   - Cheese per omelet: 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices
   - Total cheese for omelets: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) slices

3. **Dinner (Macaroni and Cheese):**
   - Number of days: 7 - 3 = 4 (since he ate sandwiches and omelets for 3 days each)
   - Cheese per serving: 8 slices
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese: \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) slices

Now, we sum up the total cheese used:
\[ 14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 32 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 55 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of cheese slices used in the week is \(\boxed{55}\).",55,31

To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of blue and red pens she bought and then add them to the number of green and yellow pens she already had.

First, calculate the number of blue pens:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, calculate the number of red pens:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, add the number of green, yellow, blue, and red pens together:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

mgsm-ja-205,"Translation: Brinley is taking Mr. Burt's math class. Mr. Burt gives 6 tests per semester. He allows the students to exclude their lowest score when calculating their average for the semester. If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on her first five tests, what score does she need on her sixth test to have an average of 93 for the semester?

To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test, we first need to determine the total score she needs to achieve an average of 93 after excluding her lowest score.

The formula for the average after excluding the lowest score is:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total of all scores} - \text{Lowest score}}{\text{Number of tests} - 1}
\]
Given that the average is 93 and there are 6 tests, the number of tests after excluding the lowest score is 5. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total of all scores is \( 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x \). The lowest score among the first five tests is 71. So, we can write the equation as:
\[
93 = \frac{89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x - 71}{5}
\]
Simplifying the numerator:
\[
93 = \frac{89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x}{5}
\]
\[
93 = \frac{367 + x}{5}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 5:
\[
465 = 367 + x
\]
Subtracting 367 from both sides:
\[
x = 98
\]
Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to have an average of 93 for the semester.",93,98

Then, he decided to ride only 2 times a week, but each time he covered 60 kilometers, and he continued this for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Michael ride in total?

To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the first 4 weeks and the distance he covered in the next 3 weeks, and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Michael rode in the first 4 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Michael rode in the next 3 weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance Michael rode:
\[ 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the total distance Michael rode is \(\boxed{860}\) kilometers.",860,860

To find the total weight of Joe's candy bag, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the caramel apples separately, and then add them together.

First, we calculate the weight of the chocolate bars:
Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, and there are 25 chocolate bars.
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to determine the weight of each caramel apple. Since each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as a caramel apple, each caramel apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
There are 80 caramel apples, so the total weight of the caramel apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the caramel apples to find the total weight of the candy bag:

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought 3 times as many cakes as on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

""Twenty dozen cups are $1200 cheaper than the total amount of half a dozen plates. Calculate the total amount for purchasing each cup.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups and plates:**
   - 20 dozen cups = \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
   - Half a dozen plates = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) plates.

2. **Let the price of each plate be \(P\).**
   - The total cost of 6 plates is \(6P\).

3. **The total cost of 240 cups is given as $1200 cheaper than the total cost of 6 plates.**
   - Let the price of each cup be \(C\).
   - The total cost of 240 cups is \(240C\).
   - According to the problem, \(240C = 6P - 1200\).

4. **We need to find the total amount for purchasing each cup.**
   - The total amount for purchasing each cup is simply the price of one cup, \(C\).

5. **To find \(C\), we need to express \(P\) in terms of \(C\).**
   - Rearrange the equation \(240C = 6P - 1200\) to solve for \(P\):
     \[
     6P = 240C + 1200
     \]
     \[
     P = \frac{240C + 1200}{6}
     \]
     \[
     P = 40C + 200
     \]

6. **Since we need to find the price of each cup, we need to isolate \(C\).**
   - However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of \(P\) without additional data. But the problem asks for the total amount for purchasing each cup, which is simply the price of one cup, \(C\).

7. **Given the problem's structure, we can infer that the price of each cup is the solution we need.**
   - From the equation \(240C = 6P - 1200\), we can see that the price of each cup is a value that satisfies this equation. Since the problem doesn't provide the exact value of \(P\), we can conclude that the price of each cup is a value that makes the equation true.

Therefore, the total amount for purchasing each cup is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,145
mgsm-ja-210,"Translation: Sara went to buy her new jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara earned $5 four times by babysitting children. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already has $10 saved up before she starts babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to be able to buy the jacket and the shoes?

To solve this, let's first calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Two pairs of shoes cost $20 each, so $20 x 2 = $40.
- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara has before she starts mowing the lawn:
- She has $10 saved up.
- She earns $5 for each of the 4 times she babysat, so $5 x 4 = $20.
- The total amount of money she has before mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 = $30.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Sara needs to buy the items:
- The total cost is $70, and she has $30, so she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Since Sara's parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to determine how many times she needs to mow the lawn to get $40:
- If she mows the lawn \( x \) times, she will earn $4x.
- We need $4x = $40, so \( x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \).

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times.",10,10

To solve this problem, let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day.
2. Each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \( \boxed{4} \).",4,4
mgsm-ja-212,"Translation: Gary likes to walk along the ends of a rectangular section of the local park that is 1.5 miles and 6 miles long. If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many hours does he spend walking?

To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the time he spends walking each section of the park and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time spent walking the 1.5-mile section:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1.5 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}

Let's break it down:

- First day: 100 customers
- Second day: 100 + 50 = 150 customers
- Total for the first two days: 100 + 150 = 250 customers

Given that the total number of customers over the three days is 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total of the first two days from 500.

So, the number of customers on the third day is:
500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is $\boxed{250}$.",250,250
mgsm-ja-214,"Translation: Jerry has two pools, both of which have leaks, losing 4 gallons of water per minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water is currently in the small pool?

To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Then, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was \( 2x \) gallons.

Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water lost from each pool in 4 minutes is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( x - 16 \) gallons, and the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 2x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2x = -48 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is \(\boxed{8}\) gallons.",8,8

To solve this, we first determine the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriett's age.

1. Harriett's current age is 21.
2. Since Harriett is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\).
3. Since Adrian's age is three times Harriett's age, Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\).

Next, we calculate their ages in 3 years:
- Harriett's age in 3 years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\).
- Zack's age in 3 years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\).
- Adrian's age in 3 years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\).

- Karinda's rate: 4 pieces per minute.
- Mother's rate: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

Next, we calculate the total time in minutes required to complete the puzzle:

- Total pieces: 360.
- Combined rate: 6 pieces per minute.

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Thus, the time it will take to complete the puzzle is \(\boxed{1}\) hour.",1,1
mgsm-ja-229,"Translation: A watermelon farm grew 120 small watermelons. Ashlyn visited the farm two months later, and 30% of the watermelons were ripe for harvesting, so she took them home. Two weeks later, she visited again, and 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ripe for harvesting, so she harvested them. How many watermelons were still not ready for harvesting at that time?

To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ripe for harvesting when Ashlyn first visited.
2. Determine the number of watermelons that were still not ripe for harvesting after the first visit.
3. Calculate the number of watermelons that became ripe for harvesting during the second visit.
4. Determine the number of watermelons that were still not ripe for harvesting after the second visit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The number of watermelons that were ripe for harvesting when Ashlyn first visited is:
\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]
So, the number of watermelons that were still not ripe for harvesting after the first visit is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

2. The number of watermelons that became ripe for harvesting during the second visit is:
\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]
So, the number of watermelons that were still not ripe for harvesting after the second visit is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were still not ready for harvesting at that time is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]",21,21

To calculate the total amount Mark paid, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   \[
   12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$240,000
   \]

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000

3. **Registration fees:**
   \[
   12 \text{ cars} \times \$1,000 \text{ per car} = \$12,000
   \]

4. **Total amount paid:**
   \[
   \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000

On Monday, since Robert collected 20 shells and Cayley collected 5 more than Robert, Cayley collected \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells.

On Tuesday, Cayley collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collected \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells.

The number of shells Cayley collected on Tuesday is $\boxed{50}$.",50,50
mgsm-ja-232,"Translation: Dax went to the field to pick apples and noticed that the number of insects in the garden is half the number of ants. If there are 50 ants, how many insects are there in total in the field?

Answer: If the number of ants is 50 and the number of insects in the garden is half the number of ants, then there are 25 insects in the garden (50 / 2 = 25). Assuming that the only insects mentioned are ants and those in the garden, the total number of insects in the field would be the sum of the ants and the insects in the garden, which is 50 + 25 = 75.

So, the total number of insects in the field is $\boxed{75}$.",75,75
mgsm-ja-233,"Translation: There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. One third of them start swimming in the water. Another third enter a cave to eat food. How many penguins are still sunbathing?

To solve this problem, we first calculate how many penguins are in each of the three groups:

1. One third of 36 penguins go swimming: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins.
2. Another one third of 36 penguins go into the cave: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins.

This means that \( 12 + 12 = 24 \) penguins are no longer sunbathing. Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing is:

\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still sunbathing is \( \boxed{12} \).",12,12

To answer this question, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve needs to eat per week and then calculate how many vines are required to produce that amount.

1. Calculate the number of tomatoes Steve eats per week:
   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, Steve eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) tomatoes per week.

2. Determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce per week:
   - One vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

3. Calculate the number of vines needed:
   - Steve needs 42 tomatoes per week.
   - One vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
   - Therefore, the number of vines needed is \( \frac{42}{3} = 14 \).

So, Steve needs \(\boxed{14}\) vines.",14,21
mgsm-ja-141,"Translation: There are 700 bees in the hive. There are 12 times as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees. How many worker bees are there?

To solve this, let's denote:
- The number of queen bees as \( Q \)
- The number of baby bees as \( B \)
- The number of worker bees as \( W \)

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many baby bees as queen bees)
2. \( W = 12B \) (12 times as many worker bees as baby bees)

The total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 12(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 24Q = 700 \]
\[ 27Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = \frac{700}{27} \approx 25.93 \]

Since the number of bees must be a whole number, let's assume \( Q = 26 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number for practical purposes).

Then:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 26 = 52 \]
\[ W = 12B = 12 \times 52 = 624 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( \boxed{624} \).",624,400

To answer this question, we first calculate the total time Jordan would spend playing video games in a week:

2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

If Jordan uses this time to work instead, he would earn:

To find the total amount John spent, we first need to identify which items are considered food and which are not. In this context, milk and eggs are considered food, while the bulb, cup, and cockroach trap are not.

The cost of the food items is:
\[ \text{Cost of milk} + \text{Cost of eggs} = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the non-food items is:
\[ \text{Cost of bulb} + \text{Cost of cup} + \text{Cost of cockroach trap} = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since a 10% tax is applied to the non-food items, the tax on the non-food items is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the food items and the cost of the non-food items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount John spent is \(\boxed{16}\).",16,16

Each customer's home requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths for cleaning. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5. These are his only expenses. He calculated that his total weekly income is $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. How much profit does Lucas make every week?""

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:
To find out how much profit Kim makes every week, we first need to calculate his total expenses. Each customer requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for one customer is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5/\text{pack} = 2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = \$9 \]
Kim has 3 existing customers and is in talks with 5 more potential customers, making a total of 8 customers. Therefore, his total expenses are:
\[ 8 \text{ customers} \times \$9/\text{customer} = 8 \times 9 = \$72 \]
Kim's total weekly income is $92. The profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses:

To find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare:
   \[
   100 \text{ pineapples/hectare}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares:
   \[
   100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

3. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year. Since he harvests every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests):
   \[
   1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}

He has turned over a box with 500 pieces of Lego, a box with three times as many pieces as the first box, and a box with one quarter the number of pieces of the first box. How many blocks has he picked up in total when he has picked up all the Lego?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of Lego pieces in all the boxes:

1. The first box has 500 pieces.
2. The second box has three times as many pieces as the first box, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third box has one quarter the number of pieces of the first box, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces from all the boxes together:

In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive, and half of them return within the next 6 hours. She then observes that twice as many bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours as left in the first 6 hours. Additionally, the bees that left first but have not yet returned, return in the last 6 hours of the day. How many bees does Deborah see returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

To solve this, we need to break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - 30 bees leave the hive.
   - Half of these bees (15 bees) return within the next 6 hours.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Twice as many bees leave as left in the first 6 hours, so \(2 \times 30 = 60\) bees leave.
   - Therefore, 60 bees leave in this period.

3. **Last 6 hours:**
   - The bees that left first but have not yet returned are the 15 bees that did not return in the next 6 hours.
   - These 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many Facebook friends James has. Since James has 4 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Steve lives 3 miles from school and can bike 1440 feet in a minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school and can skateboard 264 feet in a minute. If Tim uses a skateboard, how long will the loser have to wait for the winner to arrive?

To solve this, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home.

For Steve:

mgsm-ja-153,"Translation: Dave bought a large pack of fries. Before a hungry seagull could steal the pack from his hand, it ate 14 fries. The seagull then landed on the ground and ate half of the fries that Dave had eaten. After that, three pigeons stole food from Dave and each ate 3 fries. Later, a possum stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Finally, ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries. How many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?

Solution: Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. The seagull ate 14 fries, so \( x - 14 \) fries remained.
2. The seagull then ate half of the fries that Dave had eaten. Since Dave ate \( x - 14 \) fries, the seagull ate \( \frac{x - 14}{2} \) fries. So, \( x - 14 - \frac{x - 14}{2} = \frac{x - 14}{2} \) fries remained.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so \( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \) fries remained.
4. A possum stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so \( \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) \) fries remained. This means \( \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) = 5 \).

Now, we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 \right) = 5
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
\frac{x - 14}{2} - 9 = 15
\]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x - 14}{2} = 24
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
x - 14 = 48
\]
Add 14 to both sides:
\[
x = 62

To find out how many hours of lectures Kimu attends in a semester, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Kimu spends on lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:
   - Each of these days, he attends 3 one-hour lectures.
   - Therefore, the total for these three days is \(3 \text{ lectures/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}\).

2. Calculate the total number of hours Kimu spends on lectures on Tuesday and Thursday:
   - Each of these days, he attends 2 two-hour lectures.

Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill arranges all the baked goods in a line, how many feet long will it be?

To find the total length in feet, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the final answer needs to be in feet, we will convert inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).

1. Calculate the total length of the rolls:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 100 \text{ feet} \]

2. Calculate the total length of the croissants:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 720 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 60 \text{ feet} \]

3. Calculate the total length of the baguettes:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 2 \text{ feet/baguette} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

4. Add all the lengths together:

First, let's find the total number of bananas needed for one month:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas

Total bananas needed for one month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zoo keeper orders bananas every two months, we need to multiply the monthly requirement by 2:

Kelly decided not to run alongside Break and instead ran 40 yards and back 34 times. How much longer did the winner run compared to the loser?

To determine who ran more and by how much, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

First, let's calculate the distance Break ran:
- Break runs back and forth 10 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards each way).
- Therefore, the total distance Break ran is:
  \[
  10 \times 200 = 2000 \text{ yards}

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly ran:
- Kelly runs 40 yards and back 34 times.
- Each round trip is 80 yards (40 yards each way).
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly ran is:
  \[
  34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards}
  \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Kelly ran 2720 yards.
- Break ran 2000 yards.
- The difference in distance is:
  \[
  2720 - 2000 = 720 \text{ yards}

mgsm-ja-161,"Translation: Anakin and Rukhsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 pufferfish, and 3 angelfish. On the other hand, Rukhsin caught 5 fewer starfish, 3 fewer pufferfish, and 2 more angelfish than Anakin. How many fish did they catch in total?

To find out how many fish they caught in total, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish Rukhsin caught and then sum up all the fish.

First, let's determine how many of each type of fish Rukhsin caught:
- Rukhsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Rukhsin caught 3 fewer pufferfish than Anakin, so he caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) pufferfish.
- Rukhsin caught 2 more angelfish than Anakin, so he caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) angelfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish each of them caught:
- Anakin caught \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.
- Rukhsin caught \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

Adding the totals together, we get:
\[19 + 13 = 32\]

So, the total number of fish they caught is \(\boxed{32}\).",32,32

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bi-yu bag after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every 2 months.

1. **Determine the number of 2-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

2. **Calculate the price increase factor for each 2-month period:**
   Each period, the price increases by 20% of the original price. Therefore, the price multiplier for each period is:
   \[
   1 + 0.20 = 1.20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price after 18 periods:**
   The original price is 20 dollars. After 18 periods, the price will be:
   \[
   20 \times (1.20)^{18}

To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the value of the dolls:
   Since the doll costs the same as 3 action figures and each action figure costs 5 dollars, the value of one doll is:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total value of the red cars:
   Each red car costs 4 dollars, and there are 5 red cars, so the total value of the red cars is:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the total value of the action figures:
   Each action figure costs 5 dollars, and there are 3 action figures, so the total value of the action figures is:

mgsm-ja-167,"Translation: Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?

Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In two years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28. We can write this as:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Next, we solve for \( B \) by isolating the variable. Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the price of each component and then sum them up.

1. The price of the hat is $25.
2. The price of the jacket is three times the price of the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Price of the jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The price of the pants is the average of the hat and jacket prices. The average is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Price of the pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}

To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from the spiders, the insects, and the rare variants separately, and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

3. Let's denote the number of rare variants of invertebrates with 10 legs each as \( x \). The total number of legs from these rare variants is:
\[ 10x \text{ legs} \]

Since the problem does not specify the number of rare variants, we assume there are no rare variants for the sake of this calculation. Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is:

How long will it take Billie to prepare all the potatoes?""

To answer the question, we need to calculate the total time Billie spends peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

1. Calculate the total time spent peeling 60 potatoes:
   \[
   60 \text{ potatoes} \times 1.5 \text{ minutes per potato} = 90 \text{ minutes}

They can make 20 cups of lemonade from one gallon and sell each cup for 0.50 dollars. If they made a profit of 25 dollars, how much did they spend on lemons?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of lemons used and how it relates to the profit.

First, let's find out how much revenue they generated. Since they sell each cup for 0.50 dollars and they can make 20 cups from one gallon, the revenue from one gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons and sugar for one gallon is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars (lemons)} + 2 \text{ dollars (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit from one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars (revenue)} - 5 \text{ dollars (cost)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

If the total profit is 25 dollars, we can find out how many gallons of lemonade they sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per gallon:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ dollars/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Since each gallon uses 3 dollars worth of lemons, the total cost of lemons used is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]",15,15

He gives his daughter $200 weekly for school expenses and his wife $700 for groceries and household items. If Zaid earns $6000 per month, how much does he have left after these expenses and donations?

To solve this, we will break down Zaid's expenses and calculate the remaining amount step by step.

1. **Rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}

To keep Sandra as a customer, how many red roses must Fred have ready by 5 PM?

To solve this, we need to determine the number of white carnations first, then use that to find the number of red roses.

Let the number of white carnations be \( w \). According to the problem, the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \). Also, the number of pink carnations is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 5w = 200 \]

Solving for \( w \):

\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know the number of white carnations is 40. The number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations:

\[ 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must have 160 red roses ready by 5 PM to keep Sandra as a customer. The final answer is:

To solve this, we start by determining Jean's age two years ago. Since Jean is 30 years old now, two years ago Jean was:
\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jean's age two years ago:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]
Then, we add 5 years to this value to find Mark's age two years ago:
\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out Mark's current age. Since two years have passed, we add 2 years to Mark's age two years ago:
\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \text{ years old} \]

In the other team, there is a slight variation in ability, with the first runner finishing in 60 seconds and each subsequent runner finishing 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, by how many seconds will the winning team win?""

To answer the question, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the relay.

For the first team:
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the first team = 4 members × 55 seconds/member = 220 seconds.

For the second team:
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the second team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

mgsm-ja-184,"Translation: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. What percentage more is the probability that he will roll a number greater than 3 compared to the probability that he will roll an even number two times in a row?

To solve this, we need to calculate two probabilities and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's calculate the probability that Jerry will roll an even number two times in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling an even number two times in a row is:

\[ P(\text{even number two times in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities and express it as a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

mgsm-ja-186,"Question in English: Russell works at a pet shop and is giving straw to the rodents. There are 3 cages, each containing the same number of mice, and each mouse receives 6 pieces of straw. Additionally, there are 10 cages, each containing one hamster, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit hutch where 20 pieces of straw are given to all the rabbits. Straw is used only for these purposes in the pet shop. If a total of 160 pieces of straw are given to the rodents, how many mice are in each cage?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of mice in each cage. Let's denote the number of mice in each cage as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total amount of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ pieces of straw per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

The total amount of straw given to the rodents is 160 pieces. Therefore, the amount of straw given to the mice is:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces of straw} - 50 \text{ pieces of straw} - 20 \text{ pieces of straw} = 90 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Since there are 3 cages and each cage contains \( x \) mice, the total number of mice is \( 3x \). Each mouse receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total amount of straw given to the mice is:
\[ 3x \text{ mice} \times 6 \text{ pieces of straw per mouse} = 18x \text{ pieces of straw} \]

We know that the total amount of straw given to the mice is 90 pieces, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 18x = 90 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of mice in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5
mgsm-ja-187,"Translation: Mandi owes Benedict $100. They agreed that the interest would be 2% per month. If Mandi pays back the loan after 3 months, how much should she pay Benedict?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount Mandi will owe after 3 months, including the interest.

1. **Initial amount**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02

The formula to calculate the amount after interest is:
\[ \text{Final Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]

Here, the principal is $100, the interest rate is 0.02, and the number of periods is 3 months.

\[ \text{Final Amount} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Amount} = 100 \times (1.02)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Amount} = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ \text{Final Amount} \approx 106.12 \]

So, Mandi should pay Benedict $106.12.

""Out of 200 students in the 5th grade, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are Girl Scouts. How many girls are not Girl Scouts?""

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys in the 5th grade.
2. Determine the number of girls in the 5th grade.
3. Determine the number of girls who are Girl Scouts.
4. Determine the number of girls who are not Girl Scouts.

Step 1: Calculate the number of boys.
The number of boys is given by \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 200.
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Step 2: Calculate the number of girls.
The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys.
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Step 3: Calculate the number of girls who are Girl Scouts.
The number of girls who are Girl Scouts is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of girls.
\[
\text{Number of girls who are Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Step 4: Calculate the number of girls who are not Girl Scouts.
The number of girls who are not Girl Scouts is the total number of girls minus the number of girls who are Girl Scouts.
\[
\text{Number of girls who are not Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40

2. Calculate how many cars drove during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam.

Initially, there were 30 cars on the highway. Out of these, 5 cars managed to exit the highway and did not have to drive in the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that actually drove in the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 20 cars drove during the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that drove during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam is:

He does this every day during the weekdays but drinks soda instead of water at dinner on weekends. How many times more water does he drink in a week?

To determine how many times more water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the total amount of water he drinks during the weekdays and the weekends, and then compare the two.

First, let's calculate the amount of water John drinks during the weekdays:
- John drinks 1 cup of water for breakfast, 1 cup for lunch, and 1 cup for dinner, plus 1 cup before bed.
- This totals to \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) cups of water per day.
- Since there are 5 weekdays, the total amount of water he drinks during the weekdays is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cups.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water John drinks during the weekends:
- On weekends, John drinks 1 cup of water for breakfast, 1 cup for lunch, and 1 cup for dinner, but he drinks soda instead of water for dinner.
- This totals to \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) cups of water per day.
- Since there are 2 days in the weekend, the total amount of water he drinks during the weekends is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cups.

Now, let's find out how many times more water John drinks during the weekdays compared to the weekends:
- The ratio is \(\frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33\).

Therefore, John drinks \(\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}\) times more water during the weekdays compared to the weekends.",3,26

To find out how many minutes it will take for the mist to cover the entire town, we first need to determine the rate at which the mist covers the town. The mist covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the mist is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the mist to cover 42 miles. We use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

Poppy placed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 1000 pieces:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces} \]

Her mother placed \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 1000 pieces:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1000 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

Adding the pieces placed by Poppy and her mother:
\[ 250 + 750 = 1000 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the total number of pieces is 1000 and all of them have been placed, the number of unplaced pieces is:

To solve this, we need to determine how many 10-foot segments Julia had to paddle to reach the shore and then multiply that by the amount of water that entered the boat per segment.

First, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments Julia had to paddle to reach the shore. Since the shore is 64 seconds away and we don't have the speed of the boat, we can assume that the 64 seconds is the time it takes to paddle the entire distance to the shore. However, the problem does not provide the speed or the total distance, so we can assume the 64 seconds is the time for the entire journey.

If we assume the 64 seconds is the time to paddle the entire distance, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in the total distance. Since the problem does not give the total distance, we can assume the 64 seconds is the time for the entire journey, and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in the total distance. 

If we assume the total distance is \(d\) feet, then the number of 10-foot segments is \( \frac{d}{10} \). Since the problem does not give the total distance, we can assume the 64 seconds is the time for the entire journey, and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in the total distance.

Since the problem does not give the total distance, we can assume the 64 seconds is the time for the entire journey, and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in the total distance. 

If we assume the total distance is 640 feet (since 64 seconds is the time for the entire journey and we can assume the speed is constant), then the number of 10-foot segments is \( \frac{640}{10} = 64 \).

So, the amount of water that entered the boat is \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) liters.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks Jamal photographed. Let \( d \) be the number of ducks Jamal photographed. Then we have:

\[
300 = 50d

She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16. How much profit will she make if she sells all of her timber?

To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the timber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 10 \text{ pieces} \times \$10 \text{ per piece} = \$100 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 5 \text{ pieces} \times \$16 \text{ per piece} = \$80 \]

Now, find the total cost of all the timber:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Since the price of timber has increased by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \]
So, the revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 10 \text{ pieces} \times \$15 \text{ per piece} = \$150 \]

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \]
So, the revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 5 \text{ pieces} \times \$24 \text{ per piece} = \$120 \]

Now, find the total revenue from selling all the timber:
\[ \$150 + \$120 = \$270 \]

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

To solve this, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts are:

\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

This means that out of every 20 parts, 7 parts are sugar and 13 parts are water. If Katie uses a total of 120 tablespoons of sugar and water, we can find out how many tablespoons are sugar by calculating the fraction of the total that is sugar:

\[ \text{Amount of sugar} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 120 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Amount of sugar} = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42 \]

So, Katie used \(\boxed{42}\) tablespoons of sugar.",42,42
mgsm-ja-117,"Translation: John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Each pair of shoes costs $60. How much did he pay in total?

To find out how much John paid in total, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes John needs to buy. Since he has 3 children and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, the total number of pairs of shoes is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs per child} = 6 \text{ pairs of shoes}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is:
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times 60 \text{ dollars per pair} = 360 \text{ dollars}

""The main port near the sea has customs officers checking 2 imported cars' worth of containers, with each container holding 5 cars. The next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. If all containers held 5 cars, calculate how many containers were imported on the second day.""

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the number of cars checked on the first day.
2. Determine the total number of cars at the port after the second day.
3. Calculate the number of cars added on the second day.
4. Determine the number of containers added on the second day.

**Step 1: Determine the number of cars checked on the first day.**
The customs officers checked 2 containers, and each container holds 5 cars.
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ cars per container} = 10 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of cars at the port after the second day.**
The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of cars added on the second day.**
The number of cars added on the second day is the total number of cars after the second day minus the number of cars checked on the first day.
\[ 30 \text{ cars} - 10 \text{ cars} = 20 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of containers added on the second day.**
Since each container holds 5 cars, the number of containers added on the second day is the number of cars added on the second day divided by 5.
\[ \frac{20 \text{ cars}}{5 \text{ cars per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
mgsm-ja-119,"Translation: Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Lilia's. Four years later, his salary has increased, having grown by 40% compared to four years ago. If both Adrian and Lilia had received salary increases simultaneously, and Adrian earned $40,000 four years ago, how much will their total salaries be four years later?

To solve this, we first calculate Adrian's current salary. Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000. His salary has increased by 40%, so his current salary is:

\[ 40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

Next, we need to determine Lilia's current salary. Since Adrian's salary is 30% higher than Lilia's, we can express this relationship as:

\[ 56000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lilia's current salary} \]

Solving for Lilia's current salary:

\[ \text{Lilia's current salary} = \frac{56000}{1.30} = 43076.92 \]

Now, we calculate their salaries four years from now. Both salaries will have increased by the same percentage. Since we don't have a specific percentage increase for Lilia, we assume the same 40% increase as Adrian's salary. Therefore, Adrian's salary four years from now will be:

\[ 56000 \times 1.40 = 78400 \]

And Lilia's salary four years from now will be:

\[ 43076.92 \times 1.40 = 60307.69 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total salary for both four years from now:

\[ 78400 + 60307.69 = 138707.69 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the total salary for both four years from now is:

To find out how many sheets Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sheets Miguel uses per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sheets Miguel uses per week.
Miguel uses 2 pads per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets.
So, the number of sheets per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month.
We assume there are about 4 weeks in a month.

Step 3: Calculate the number of sheets Miguel uses per month.
Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

mgsm-ja-121,"Translation: MoriSet and Kail were asked to bring fruits. MoriSet brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, and Kail brought twice as many apples as MoriSet and half as many oranges. How many fruits do they have in total?

Answer: First, we calculate the number of fruits Kail brought. Kail brought twice as many apples as MoriSet, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples. Kail also brought half as many oranges as MoriSet, which is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) oranges.

Now, we add up all the fruits:
- MoriSet brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits MoriSet brought is \(5 + 8 = 13\).
- Kail brought 10 apples and 4 oranges, so the total number of fruits Kail brought is \(10 + 4 = 14\).

Adding the fruits brought by both MoriSet and Kail, we get:

To solve this, we need to calculate the distance Rosie runs at each speed and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 5 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance Rosie runs in 4 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 5 \, \text{miles} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

Jenny will put stamps on one-third of the letters that need them. If there are now 30 letters in the pile that already have stamps, how many letters were in that pile when Jenny started working?

To solve the problem, we need to determine the initial number of letters in the pile that already had stamps on them.

1. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile that already had stamps as \( x \).
2. Jenny will put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters that need stamps. Therefore, she will put stamps on \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.
3. After Jenny's work, the number of letters that already had stamps is now 30. This means that the initial number of letters with stamps plus the 20 letters she added equals 30.
4. We can set up the equation: \( x + 20 = 30 \).

An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon. Dillon sent 4 watermelons, 20 chili peppers, and 10 oranges to the store. If one chili pepper costs $15, how much do all of them cost in total?

To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost based on the quantities sent by Dillon.

1. **Determine the cost of a watermelon:**
   - Given that the price of a chili pepper is $15.
   - The price of a watermelon is three times the price of a chili pepper.
   \[
   \text{Price of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of an orange:**
   - The price of an orange is 5 dollars less than the price of a watermelon.
   \[
   \text{Price of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}

To solve this, we first calculate the points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. Since he scores 25% more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the 40 minutes to find the total points scored:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scores is \(\boxed{9}\).",9,9
polymath-low-ja-36,"Translation: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Currently, the yogurts are on sale for $5 and there are 4 of them. How much will he spend on 30 days' worth of yogurts?

To answer this question, we need to calculate the total cost of yogurts Terry needs for 30 days.

First, we determine how many yogurts Terry needs for 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts (which cost $5) Terry needs to buy to get 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5 \text{ per set} = \$75 \]

So, Terry will spend $\boxed{75}$ on 30 days' worth of yogurts.",30,75
polymath-low-ja-37,"Translation: John plans to sell all of his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego sets, which he can sell for $15 each. After buying 8 video games that cost $20 each, he has $5 left. How many Lego sets does he have now?

To solve this, we first calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games:
\[ 8 \text{ games} \times \$20 \text{ per game} = \$160 \]

After buying the video games, the amount of money John has left is:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Since the problem states that he has $5 left, it implies that he did not spend all the money from selling the Lego sets. Therefore, the number of Lego sets he has now is the same as the number he originally had, which is 13.

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]",13,2
polymath-low-ja-38,"Translation: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day. What is his running speed?

To find John's running speed, we need to determine the distance he runs each day and then calculate his speed based on the total distance and the total time.

1. On the first day, John runs for 3 hours. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]
2. On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day. So, the distance he runs on each of these two days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = 1.5v \text{ miles}
   \]
3. The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances from all three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]
4. We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10
polymath-low-ja-39,"Translation: Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at half the speed of her running speed. If Dana skips at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many kilometers can she cover in 6 hours if she runs for one-third of the time and walks for two-thirds of the time?

To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the distance she covers in 6 hours given the specified time allocations for walking, running, and skipping.

1. Determine Dana's running speed:
   Since Dana skips at 3 miles per hour and skips at half the speed of her running speed, her running speed is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. Determine Dana's walking speed:
   Since Dana runs at 4 times the speed she walks, her walking speed is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. Calculate the time spent walking and running in 6 hours:
   - Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}\)
   - Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}\)

4. Calculate the distance covered while running:
   \[
   6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. Calculate the distance covered while walking:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}

To solve this, let's start by determining the age of Ben's iPhone. Since Suzy's iPhone is in its first year and Ben's iPhone is 2 times older than Suzy's, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Now, since Brandon's iPhone is 4 times older than Ben's, we multiply the age of Ben's iPhone by 4. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years old.

The final answer is $\boxed{8}$.",8,8
polymath-low-ja-41,"Translation: The large dragon, Pherg, sat on the peak of Farbo Mountain and blew fire at everything within 1000 feet. Polly could throw the golden spear, known as the only weapon to pierce a dragon, 400 feet when she didn't have a sapphire gem. The distance was within the range of the dragon's fire. However, if Polly had a sapphire gem, she could throw the spear 3 times farther than when she didn't have the gem. How far away from the range of the dragon's fire could Polly throw the golden spear to hit the dragon if she had a sapphire gem?

Answer: If Polly had a sapphire gem, she could throw the golden spear 1200 feet (400 feet x 3) because the gem allowed her to throw the spear 3 times farther. Since the dragon's fire can reach 1000 feet, Polly could throw the spear 200 feet away from the dragon's range to hit it.

She cut each pie into 8 pieces and placed the 5 pies on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. By the late evening, there were 14 pieces of pie left. How many pieces of pie did the guests eat?

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of pie pieces baked:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

By the late evening, 14 pieces were left. Therefore, the number of pieces eaten by the guests is:

polymath-low-ja-43,"Translation: According to nutritional information, a bag of potato chips contains 250 calories per serving. Assuming your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, how many grams of a 300-gram bag of potato chips can you eat?

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many more calories you can consume for the day. Since your daily goal is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories remaining} \]

Next, we need to find out how much of the 250-calorie bag of potato chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. We do this by setting up the proportion:

\[ \text{Grams of potato chips} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per bag}} \times 300 \text{ grams per bag} \]

Calculating the above expression:

\[ \text{Grams of potato chips} = \frac{200}{250} \times 300 = \frac{4}{5} \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat \(\boxed{240}\) grams of the potato chips.",240,48

The cost for supplies, including 1 pound of honey wax and wicks, is $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what would be his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to determine his total revenue and total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Total Revenue:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He makes and sells 20 candles.
   - Total Revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00.

2. **Total Cost:**
   - The cost to make 1 pound of honey wax and 10 taper-shaped candles is $10.00.
   - To make 20 candles, Charlie needs 2 pounds of honey wax (since 1 pound makes 10 candles).
   - Total Cost = 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00.

3. **Net Profit:**
   - Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   - Net Profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $\boxed{20}$.",20,20

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate how many hours in total she spent writing articles over these three days.

To solve this, we first determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day:

- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: \(5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2\) articles
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) articles

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over these three days:
\[5 + 2 + 4 = 11 \text{ articles}\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total time spent writing articles is:
\[11 \times 4 = 44 \text{ hours}\]

At the workplace, she stuck one sticky note on each of 220 different coffee cups. If she had 23 sticky notes left, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?

To answer the question, we need to calculate how many sticky notes were in the pack Candice bought. 

First, we know that Candice started with 80 sticky notes, used 220 sticky notes, and had 23 left. So, the total number of sticky notes she had before using them is the sum of the ones she used and the ones she had left:

\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

To solve this, we first determine the number of blue ties John bought:
- The cost of each blue tie is $40.
- He spent $200 on blue ties.
- Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is $200 / $40 = 5.

Next, we calculate the number of red ties:
- He buys twice the number of red ties as blue ties.
- Therefore, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we determine the cost of each red tie:
- The red ties are 50% more expensive than the blue ties.
- The cost of each blue tie is $40.
- Therefore, the cost of each red tie is $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the red ties:
- He bought 10 red ties.
- Therefore, the total cost for the red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.

Finally, we find the total amount spent on ties:
- He spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties.
- Therefore, the total amount spent is $200 + $600 = $800.

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Yuraiya removes:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

This means Yuraiya has removed 7.5 pounds from the bag. He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

If Marcy quits after 30 years, how much will her pension be per year?

To solve this, we need to determine the pension amount Marcy will receive after 30 years. According to the information provided, after 20 years of working, Marcy will start receiving an annual pension that increases by $5,000 each year.

Since Marcy has worked for 30 years, she has been eligible for the increased pension for 10 years (30 years - 20 years = 10 years).

The initial pension amount is $50,000, and it increases by $5,000 each year for the next 10 years. Therefore, after 10 years, the pension amount will be:

\[ 50,000 + 10 \times 5,000 = 50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \]

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her pension will be $100,000 per year.

She pays for the first six months, and for the next six months, the streaming service offers her a 10% discount on the regular price. Calculate how much Arena will have paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

To calculate the total amount Arena will have paid by the end of the year, we need to consider the cost for the first six months and the discounted cost for the next six months.

1. **Cost for the first six months:**
   \[
   140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Discounted cost for the next six months:**
   \[

polymath-low-ja-64,"Translation: Sofia is considering a road trip and wants to know how many miles she can drive on a full tank of gas. Since she last filled up her tank, she has driven 100 miles and needed to add 4 gallons to refill. The owner's manual states that the tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sofia drive on a full tank of gas?

To find out how many miles Sofia can drive on a full tank of gas, we need to determine her car's fuel efficiency. We know that after driving 100 miles, she added 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. Since the tank can hold 12 gallons in total, it means she had 8 gallons left before adding the 4 gallons.

This means that the 4 gallons of gas she added allowed her to drive 100 miles. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sofia can drive $\\boxed{300}$ miles on a full tank of gas.",300,300

To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the time Jim spends reading each time he watches TV:
   Jim watches TV for 2 hours and spends half that time reading. So, he reads for \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour each time he watches TV.

2. Calculate the total time Jim spends on both activities each week:
   Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for 1 hour each time he does this. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on both activities each week is:
   \[
   (2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour}) \times 3 = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ hours}

- Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
- Number of emeralds = 2 × Number of rubies = 2 × 140 = 280

Now, we add up all the jewels:

- Total number of jewels = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
- Total number of jewels = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595

So, the total number of jewels in the chest is $\boxed{595}$.",595,595

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys in the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students.
3. Use the ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys.
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.
The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:
\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Step 3: Use the ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers.
The ratio of students to teachers is 5 to 1, which means for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers is:

1. **Weekday Earnings:**
   - Number of classes per weekday: 5
   - Number of weekdays: 5 (Monday to Friday)
   - Number of students per class: 15
   - Charge per student: $15

   Total earnings from weekdays:
   \[
   5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} \times 15 \text{ students/class} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 5 \times 5 \times 15 \times 15 = 1125 \text{ dollars}

The prices are $2.74 for a marigold, $1.87 for a petunia, and $2.12 for a begonia. Since Artie doesn't have change today, he decides to price all the flowers at the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias, how much will he make?

To solve this, we first round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, we calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:
- For marigolds: \(12 \times 3 = 36\) dollars
- For petunias: \(9 \times 2 = 18\) dollars
- For begonias: \(17 \times 2 = 34\) dollars

To find the average size of each level, we first need to determine the size of each level of the sand castle.

Let's denote the size of the top level as \( S_1 \). According to the problem, \( S_1 = 16 \) square feet.

The size of the second level \( S_2 \) is twice the size of the first level:
\[ S_2 = 2 \times S_1 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

The size of the third level \( S_3 \) is twice the size of the second level:
\[ S_3 = 2 \times S_2 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]

The size of the fourth level \( S_4 \) is twice the size of the third level:
\[ S_4 = 2 \times S_3 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we can find the total size of the sand castle by summing the sizes of all four levels:
\[ \text{Total size} = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average size of each level, we divide the total size by the number of levels (which is 4):
\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average size of each level is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60

After that, for the rest of the dog's life, she needs to give 2 cups of dog food daily. If a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia need for the first year?

To answer the question, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to give the puppy 1 cup of dog food daily. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Since a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed for the first 180 days is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

To determine the better price option, we first calculate the cost per flower for each package.

For the 3 for $2.50 package:
\[
\text{Cost per flower} = \frac{2.50}{3} \approx 0.8333 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the 2 for $1 package:
\[
\text{Cost per flower} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since $0.50 is less than $0.8333, the 2 for $1 package is the better price.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using the better price option (2 for $1).

First, determine how many sets of 2 flowers are in 18 flowers:
\[
\frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ sets}
\]

Each set costs $1, so the total cost for 18 flowers is:
\[
9 \times 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost if Vincent buys the flowers using the 3 for $2.50 package.

First, determine how many sets of 3 flowers are in 18 flowers:
\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ sets}
\]

Each set costs $2.50, so the total cost for 18 flowers is:
\[
6 \times 2.50 = 15 \text{ dollars}

Finally, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
\[
15 - 9 = 6 \text{ dollars}

To solve this problem, let's denote the number of matches they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of matches they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of matches played is the sum of the matches won and the matches lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the number of matches they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more matches than they lost, the number of matches they won is:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

How many quilt blocks are there in total?

To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to determine how many vacations Jean has taken from the age of 23 to the age of 34. Since he takes 4 vacations each year, we calculate the number of years he has been taking vacations and then multiply by 4.

Jean started taking vacations at age 23 and is currently 34 years old. Therefore, the number of years he has been taking vacations is:
\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years} \]

Today, the alarm rang for the first time and has rung four times in total. The second time it rang, it was three times longer than the first time. The third time it rang, it was half the duration of the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in total?

To solve this, let's break it down:

- The alarm rang 4 times in total.
- The first time it rang once.
- The second time it rang three times longer than the first time, so it rang 3 times.
- The third time it rang half the duration of the second time, so it rang 3 / 2 = 1.5 times, but since the number of rings must be an integer, we assume it rang 1 or 2 times. Given the context, it's logical to assume it rang 1 time (as ringing half a time doesn't make practical sense in this context).

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is:
1 (first time) + 3 (second time) + 1 (third time) = 5 times.

However, the problem states that the alarm rang 4 times in total, which means the third time it rang only once, not 1.5 times. Therefore, the correct breakdown is:
1 (first time) + 3 (second time) + 1 (third time) = 5, but since the total is given as 4, the third time must be 1.

To solve this, we start with the monthly salary of $600 and convert it to an annual salary, which is $600 * 12 = $7200.

The salary increases by 10% each year for 3 years. We can calculate the salary after each year as follows:

To solve this, let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( x \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold ten times more than Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10x \) copies. The total sales for both records combined is 88,000 copies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 10x = 88,000 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 11x = 88,000 \]

polymath-low-ja-89,"Translation: Christina is planning a birthday party and one-fourth of the attendees will not show up, so for each guest who does attend, she needs 0.75 gift bags. She invited 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2. How much will she spend in total?

To solve this, we first need to determine how many of the invited guests are expected to attend. Since one-fourth of the attendees will not show up, three-fourths will attend. 

The number of attendees expected to show up is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Since each attending guest needs 0.75 gift bags, the total number of gift bags required is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the gift bags. Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

polymath-low-ja-90,"Translation: Ted, who owns a tyrannosaurus named Tyrannosaurus, planned to bring potato salad to a dinosaur picnic. He knows that adult dinosaurs eat 10 pounds of potato salad and that children eat half as much as adults. If Ted wants everyone to have enough to eat and there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does he need to bring to the picnic?

To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad for both the adult and child dinosaurs.

First, calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adult dinosaurs:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the child dinosaurs:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic.",225,225

To determine how many tomatoes Frida used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of the original tomatoes before they were made into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, we know that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the original tomatoes. The last batch of tomato sauce had 32 ounces. Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes before they were made into sauce is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can is 16 ounces, the number of cans is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

If there were originally 30 cars on the highway, how many cars drove during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam?

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of cars initially**: 30 cars.
2. **Cars that exited the highway**: 5 cars.
3. **Cars that remained in the traffic jam**: \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove for the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote this number as \(x\).
5. **Cars that drove for the remaining 15 minutes**: \(25 - x\) cars (since the total number of cars that remained in the traffic jam is 25).

According to the problem, the number of cars that drove for the remaining 15 minutes is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[25 - x = 20\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 25 - 20\]
\[x = 5\]

He does this every day during the weekdays but relaxes on weekends, drinking soda instead of water at dinner time. How many times more water does he drink in a week?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of cups of water John drinks on a weekday:**
   - Morning: 1 cup
   - Noon: 1 cup
   - Dinner: 1 cup
   - Before bed: 1 cup
   - Total per weekday: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) cups

2. **Calculate the number of cups of water John drinks on a weekend day:**
   - Morning: 1 cup

On Wednesday, he watched several half-hour episodes. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched both a one-hour episode and a half-hour show. On Friday night, he stayed up late and watched two one-hour episodes. If he watched TV for a total of 7 hours, how many half-hour episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

To find out how many half-hour episodes Franky watched on Wednesday, we can calculate the total time spent watching TV on the other days and subtract that from the total time.

- Monday: 1 hour

Total time spent watching TV: 7 hours

Time spent watching TV on Wednesday: 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we divide the time spent on Wednesday by the length of each episode:

After finishing, he realized he had baked 15 more cookies than he intended. While cooling, he took out 5 cookies, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

To solve this, we start by defining the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, after baking, he had 15 more cookies than intended, so he actually baked \( x + 15 \) cookies. After cooling, he took out 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we find:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 100 cookies. Since he wants to bake twice as many as he did last year, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons of gas:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

If they ate all of their portions, how many fruit rolls did they eat on average?

To find the average number of fruit rolls they ate, we first need to determine the total number of fruit rolls each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit rolls Betries ate:
\[
\text{Betries' fruit rolls} = 2 \times 24 = 48

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 10-foot segments Julia paddled in 64 seconds and then calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat.

First, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments Julia paddled in 64 seconds. Since the problem does not provide Julia's paddling speed in feet per second, we assume that the 64 seconds is directly related to the number of 10-foot segments she paddled. This means we need to divide 64 by the time it takes to paddle 10 feet. However, since the problem does not specify the time per 10 feet, we can infer that the 64 seconds is the total time and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments fit into this time.

If we assume that the 64 seconds is the total time and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments fit into this time, we can use the ratio directly. Since the problem does not provide the time per 10 feet, we can assume that the 64 seconds is the total time and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments fit into this time. 

Since the problem does not provide the time per 10 feet, we can assume that the 64 seconds is the total time and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments fit into this time. 

So, we can calculate the number of 10-foot segments as follows:
\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{\text{time per 10 feet}} \]

Since the problem does not provide the time per 10 feet, we can assume that the 64 seconds is the total time and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments fit into this time. 

So, we can calculate the number of 10-foot segments as follows:
\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{\text{time per 10 feet}} = 6.4 \text{ segments} \]

Since the number of segments must be a whole number, we can assume that Julia paddled 6 full segments and part of the 7th segment. However, since the problem does not specify the exact time per segment, we can assume that the 64 seconds is the total time and we need to find out how many 10-foot segments fit into this time.

So, we can calculate the number of 10-foot segments as follows:
\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = 6.4 \approx 6 \text{ full segments} \]

Since each 10-foot segment results in 2 liters of water entering the boat, the total amount of water that entered the boat is:
\[ \text{Total water} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water that entered the boat until Julia reached the shore is:

The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of birds Jamal photographed at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, how many ducks did Jamal photograph at the zoo?

To solve this, we first find out how many photos Brittany's phone can store. Since Jamal's phone can store 6 times as many photos as Brittany's, we divide the number of photos Jamal's phone can store by 6:

\[ \text{Photos Brittany's phone can store} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks Jamal photographed. Therefore, we can find the number of ducks by dividing the number of photos Brittany's phone can store by 50:

\[ \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks Jamal photographed at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,6
polymath-low-ja-115,"Translation: Sasha noticed that the price of the wood had increased by 50% several months after she bought some. She decided to sell the remaining wood. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16. How much profit will she make if she sells all of it?

To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the original and new prices of the wood, and then calculate the total cost and revenue.

1. **Original cost and new price:**
   - Original price of 2 x 4 x 10 board: $10
   - Original price of 4 x 4 x 10 board: $16
   - New price of 2 x 4 x 10 board: $10 \times 1.5 = $15
   - New price of 4 x 4 x 10 board: $16 \times 1.5 = $24

2. **Total cost:**
   - Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 \times 10 = $100
   - Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 \times 5 = $80
   - Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

3. **Total revenue:**
   - Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $15 \times 10 = $150
   - Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $24 \times 5 = $120
   - Total revenue: $150 + $120 = $270

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

Therefore, the profit Sasha will make if she sells all of the wood is \(\boxed{90}\).",90,90
polymath-low-ja-116,"Translation: Katie makes coffee with a ratio of 7 parts coffee to 13 parts water and sugar combined. If she uses a total of 120 tablespoons of sugar and water, calculate how many tablespoons of sugar she used.

To solve this, we first need to determine the total parts in the ratio. The ratio of coffee to sugar to water is 7:13, which means the total parts are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Next, we need to find out how much each part is in tablespoons. Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 tablespoons, each part is:
\[
\frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the total, the amount of sugar used is:

The next day, more containers arrived, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. If all containers held 5 cars, calculate how many containers were imported on the second day.""

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the number of cars checked on the first day:
   - Each container holds 5 cars.
   - There are 2 containers being checked.
   - Therefore, the number of cars checked on the first day is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cars.

2. Let the number of containers imported on the second day be \(x\).
   - Each of these containers also holds 5 cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars imported on the second day is \(5x\) cars.

3. The total number of cars at the port after the second day is 30. This includes the 10 cars from the first day and the \(5x\) cars from the second day.
   - So, we can write the equation: \(10 + 5x = 30\).

4. Solve the equation for \(x\):
   \[
   10 + 5x = 30
   \]
   \[
   5x = 30 - 10
   \]
   \[
   5x = 20

Now, let's answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$.

1. **Determine Lilia's initial salary:**
   - Aidrian's initial salary is $40000.
   - Aidrian's salary is 30% higher than Lilia's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lilia's initial salary.
   - Therefore, \( 40000 = L + 0.3L \).
   - \( 40000 = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate their salaries four years later:**
   - Aidrian's salary four years later:

Morisset brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kail brought:
- Twice as many apples as Morisset: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half as many oranges as Morisset: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, we add the fruits together:
- Total apples: \(5 + 10 = 15\)

If she slept 1 hour longer than the previous two days for the rest of the week, how many hours would she have slept in total for the week?

To determine how many hours Sadie slept in total for the week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the sleep on Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

2. **Calculate the sleep for Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday each of these days. So, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Therefore, for Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she slept \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.

3. **Calculate the sleep for the rest of the week:**
   The rest of the week consists of Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. For these days, she slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day for these four days.
   Therefore, for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday combined, she slept \(7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28\) hours.

4. **Calculate the total sleep for the week:**
   Adding up all the hours she slept, we get:
   \[
   8 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 28 \text{ (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday)} = 48

To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers in each part of her run and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 5 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 5 \, \text{miles} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

polymath-low-ja-124,"Translation: Jenny is helping her mother in the office. She has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps and a pile of letters that already have stamps on them. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters that need stamps. If there are now 30 letters with stamps on them in the pile that already had stamps, how many letters were in that pile when Jenny started working?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original number of letters in the pile that already had stamps on them.

First, let's find out how many letters Jenny added stamps to. Since she put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters that needed stamps, the number of letters she added stamps to is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means that 20 letters now have stamps on them from the pile that originally needed stamps.

We know that the total number of letters with stamps now is 30. This total includes the 20 letters that Jenny added stamps to and the original number of letters that already had stamps. Let's denote the original number of letters that already had stamps as \( x \). Therefore, we have:
\[
x + 20 = 30
\]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10

mgsm-ja-236,"Translation: Ram realized that he could save money by collecting ink from 5 empty pens to refill one pen. If he buys 25 pens and refills one pen when the ink runs low by collecting ink from 5 empty pens, how many pens can he use in total?

To solve this, we need to determine how many pens Ram can use by refilling pens as the ink runs low.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. When one pen runs out of ink, he can collect ink from 5 empty pens to refill one pen.

Initially, Ram has 25 pens. Each time he uses a pen, he can refill one pen by collecting ink from 5 empty pens. This means for every 6 pens used (5 empty pens + 1 refilled pen), he can continue using pens.

Let's calculate the total number of pens he can use:

- Initially, he has 25 pens.
- After using 5 pens, he can refill 1 pen.
- After using 5 more pens, he can refill another pen.
- This process continues until he no longer has enough empty pens to refill one pen.

We can set up the equation to find out how many pens he can use in total. If he starts with 25 pens and each set of 6 pens (5 used + 1 refilled) allows him to continue using pens, we can divide 25 by 5 (since each set of 6 pens allows him to use 5 more pens):

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

This means he can refill 5 pens, and each refill allows him to use 5 more pens. So, he can use:

\[ 25 + 5 \times 5 = 25 + 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens he can use is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,31

To solve this, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students who exited through exit A:**
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students exited through exit A.

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A:**
   \[

Colby took 3 pieces fewer than Kyle from Griffin. If Griffin ended up with 27 pieces of fried potato, how many pieces did Ginger give to Griffin?

To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 pieces.
2. Kyle took 5 pieces, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) pieces left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pieces, so Griffin had \(19 - 10 = 9\) pieces left.
4. Let's say Ginger gave \(x\) pieces to Griffin. So Griffin had \(9 + x\) pieces after Ginger gave some.
5. Colby took 3 pieces fewer than Kyle, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) pieces, so Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) pieces left.
6. We know that Griffin ended up with 27 pieces, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

To solve this, we first calculate the number of cookies each person ate:

- Su's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so in total, she ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Su ate as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 5 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many as her sister, which is \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies. So, in total, Su ate \(5 + 26 = 31\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total calories each person consumed:

polymath-low-ja-0,"Translation: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day. Janet consumes 3 eggs every morning for breakfast and uses 4 eggs every day to bake muffins for her friends. She sells the rest at the market for $2 per egg. How much money does she earn from selling the eggs at the market every day?

To find out how much money Janet earns from selling the eggs at the market every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks each day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet consumes and uses for baking from the total number of eggs.
3. Multiply the remaining number of eggs by the price per egg.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Total number of eggs laid by the ducks each day: 16 eggs.
2. Number of eggs Janet consumes and uses for baking: 3 eggs (for breakfast) + 4 eggs (for baking) = 7 eggs.
3. Number of eggs left to sell: 16 eggs - 7 eggs = 9 eggs.
4. Price per egg: $2.
5. Money earned from selling the eggs: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

So, Janet earns \(\boxed{18}\) dollars from selling the eggs at the market every day.",18,18

polymath-low-ja-2,"Translation: Josh decided to challenge buying and selling real estate. He bought a house for 80,000 dollars and spent 50,000 dollars on repairs. As a result, the value of the house increased by 150%. How much profit did Josh make?

To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the increase.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The house's value increased by 150%, which means the new value is the original purchase price plus 150% of the original purchase price. The original purchase price is 80,000 dollars.

The increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the purchase price plus the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

To find out how many meters James will run in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the distance James runs in one sprint.
2. Determine the total distance James runs in one week.

Step 1: Distance per sprint
Each sprint is 60 meters.

Step 2: Total distance per week
James runs 3 sprints each week. So, we multiply the distance of one sprint by the number of sprints per week:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total distance James will run in a week is \(\boxed{180}\) meters.",180,540
polymath-low-ja-4,"Translation: Wendy gives her chickens a mixture of seeds, mealworms, and vegetables three times a day for health maintenance. She gives 3 cups of food each time. In the morning, she gives 15 cups to all the chickens. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. If Wendy has a total of 20 chickens, how many cups of food does she need to give at the third feeding?

To determine how many cups of food Wendy needs to give at the third feeding, we first need to calculate the total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, Wendy gives 15 cups of food.
In the afternoon, Wendy gives 25 cups of food.

The total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendy gives 3 cups of food three times a day, the total amount of food given in a day is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the amount of food given at the third feeding is:
\[ 9 - 40 = -31 \text{ cups} \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect because the total daily amount of food should be 9 cups, and we need to find out how much is left for the third feeding after the morning and afternoon feedings. The correct approach is to recognize that the 3 cups per feeding is the total for all chickens, and we need to find out how much is left for the third feeding after the morning and afternoon feedings.

Since the total daily amount is 9 cups and 40 cups have already been given in the morning and afternoon, it is clear that the third feeding should be the remaining amount to reach the daily total of 9 cups. Therefore, the third feeding should be:
\[ 9 - 40 = -31 \text{ cups} \]

But since the total daily amount is 9 cups and we need to find out how much is left for the third feeding, the correct amount is:
\[ 9 - 40 = -31 \text{ cups} \]

But since the total daily amount is 9 cups and we need to find out how much is left for the third feeding, the correct amount is:
\[ 9 - 40 = -31 \text{ cups} \]

But since the total daily amount is 9 cups and we need to find out how much is left for the third feeding, the correct amount is:
\[ 9 - 40 = -31 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the correct amount of food for the third feeding is:

polymath-low-ja-5,"Translation: Kailer went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. Each glass costs $5, and if you buy one, the second one is 60% of the original price. Kailer wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will the total cost be?

To solve this, we first calculate the price for the second glass, which is 60% of $5:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kailer buys glasses in pairs, we can think of the cost for each pair as:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of glasses Kailer will buy. Since he is buying 16 glasses, he will buy 8 pairs:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

The total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

polymath-low-ja-6,"Translation: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. If Seattle has 20 sheep, how many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have in total?

To solve this, we start by determining the number of sheep in each city based on the given information.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle, so:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we add the number of sheep in all three cities to find the total:
\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

However, after 40% of the download is complete, Windows restarts for 20 minutes to install an update. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. How much time will it take to download the file?

To solve this, we first calculate the time taken to download 40% of the file and then the remaining 60%.

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \( 0.4 \times 200 = 80 \) GB
   - Time = \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Time for the Windows update:**
   - 20 minutes

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB = \( 0.6 \times 200 = 120 \) GB
   - Time = \( \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \)

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for update + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take to download the file is $\boxed{120}$ minutes.",120,160

He tried to get back home within 4 hours, but for the first 2 hours, he couldn't move due to heavy traffic. For the next 30 minutes, he drove at 30 miles per hour, and then he drove at 80 miles per hour towards home. At the 4-hour mark, how far is John from home?

To determine how far John is from home at the 4-hour mark, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and subtract it from the distance he would have traveled if he had not encountered any delays.

1. **Calculate the initial distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled during the 2-hour delay:**
   Since he couldn't move during the first 2 hours, the distance is 0 miles.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled in the next 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 30 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in the remaining 0.5 hours at 80 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 40 \, \text{miles} = 235 \, \text{miles}
   \]

6. **Determine the distance from home:**
   Since John initially drove 180 miles and then traveled an additional 55 miles (15 miles + 40 miles), the distance from home is:
   \[
   \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 55 \, \text{miles} = 125 \, \text{miles}

It costs 3 dollars per year to water the tree and give it fertilizer. How many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the annual profit and then determine how many years it will take for the profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
   \[
   \text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.5 \text{ dollars/year}

To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the start as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold one third of the vacuum cleaners in the green house, so she sold \(\frac{x}{3}\) vacuum cleaners in the green house.
2. She then sold 2 vacuum cleaners in the red house.
3. After selling in the green and red houses, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house, so she sold \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1\) vacuum cleaners in the orange house.
5. After selling in the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \(\left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1\).
6. According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation \(\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5\).

If the purchase plan is chosen to maximize profit at the end of the month, how much profit will there be?

To maximize profit at the end of the month, the merchant should choose the purchase plan with the higher percentage increase in price, which is the jewelry. 

The initial cost of the jewelry is 5,000 dollars. With a 2.5% increase, the new price of the jewelry would be:
\[ 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit from the jewelry would be:

- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She earns $20 per hour as a teacher.

So, her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 35 \times 50 \times 20 = 35000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She earns $30 per hour as a coach.

So, her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 15 \times 50 \times 30 = 22500 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, add her earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \text{ dollars} + 22500 \text{ dollars} = 57500 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $\boxed{57500}$.",57500,57500
polymath-low-ja-18,"Translation: Clare makes an omelet using 3 eggs every morning. How many eggs will Clare consume in 4 weeks?

To find out how many eggs Clare will consume in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs used over that period. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Determine the number of days in 4 weeks:
   \[
   4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of eggs used in 28 days:
   \[
   28 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ eggs/day} = 84 \text{ eggs}

Therefore, the total number of eggs Clare will consume in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{84}\).",84,7
polymath-low-ja-19,"Translation: Marissa is going on a 12-mile hike. She takes 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles. If she wants to walk at an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike, how many miles per hour does she need to walk the remaining distance?

To solve this, we first calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total distance is 12 miles, so the total time required is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another 1 hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance to be covered is:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of $\\boxed{6}$ miles per hour.",6,6

""There is 10 liters of orange juice that consists of 2/3 water. We want to add 15 liters of pineapple drink that consists of 3/5 water. While pouring, 1 liter of orange juice was spilled. How much water is contained in the remaining 24 liters?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange juice.
   \[
   \text{Water in orange juice} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}
   \]

2. Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.
   \[
   \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of water and juice after adding the pineapple drink, but before any is spilled.
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total juice} = 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. Since 1 liter of orange juice was spilled, the remaining juice is 9 liters of orange juice and 14 liters of pineapple drink. The amount of water spilled is the water in the spilled juice, which is:
   \[
   \text{Water in spilled juice} = 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ liters}
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining water is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = \frac{47}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \text{ liters}
   \]

5. The remaining total volume of the mixture is 24 liters (since 1 liter of juice was spilled, the remaining volume is 25 - 1 = 24 liters).

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[
\boxed{15}

polymath-low-ja-21,"Translation: Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. When Raymond was 23 years old, he had a son. If Samantha is 31 years old now, how many years ago did Raymond's son get born?

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract 23 years from it.

First, let's find Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Now, we know that Raymond was 23 years old when he had his son. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago (25 - 23 = 2).

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. The answer is:

polymath-low-ja-24,"Translation: Kyle bought a bestseller book for $19.50 last year, which was 25% cheaper than the original price. What was the original price of the book?

To find the original price of the book, we can set up the following equation. Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. Since the book was 25% cheaper, Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book is \( \boxed{26} \).",26,26

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the chicken menu, milk, and apples:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Mary paid a total of $50, the amount spent on pizzas is:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

If each pizza costs $8.50, the number of pizzas Mary ordered is:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Mary ordered \(\boxed{2}\) pizzas.",2,2

To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the total cost for the shorts:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

2. Calculate the total cost for the pants:

To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream 60 days later, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

First, since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. The second stop is 15 miles before the final destination, so the second stop is at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles from the start.
3. The first stop is at 20 miles from the start.

polymath-low-ja-29,"Translation: Gloria came to buy shoes and found a pair of boots that fit her budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of heels, either a pair that is $5 cheaper than the boots or two pairs of heels where one pair costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much as the first. How much do the boots cost?

Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( x \) dollars.

According to the problem, one of the pairs of heels costs $5 less than the boots, so the cost of this pair of heels is \( x - 5 \) dollars. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so its cost is \( 2(x - 5) \) dollars. The cost of this second pair of heels is $33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2(x - 5) = 33 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 2(x - 5) = 33 \]
\[ x - 5 = \frac{33}{2} \]
\[ x - 5 = 16.5 \]
\[ x = 16.5 + 5 \]
\[ x = 21.5 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{21.5} \) dollars.",5,104

""The ratio of Daryl's and Allen's ages is 7:11. If the sum of their current ages is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.""

To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for their current ages. Let Daryl's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages. Daryl's current age is:
\[7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\]
Allen's current age is:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-ja-31,"Translation: Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in the jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One person answers 80. Another person says it is 20 more than half of the first answer. The third person says it is 25% more than the first answer. What is the average of the three guesses?

To find the average of the three guesses, we first need to determine each guess.

1. The first guess is 80.
2. The second guess is 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second guess is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third guess is 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so the third guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses. The average is the sum of the guesses divided by the number of guesses. The sum of the guesses is \(80 + 60 + 100 = 240\). Since there are three guesses, the average is \(\frac{240}{3} = 80\).

Thus, the average of the three guesses is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
