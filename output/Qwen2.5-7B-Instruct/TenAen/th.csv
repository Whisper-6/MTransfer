""John bought red ties more than twice the number of blue ties. The price of a red tie is 50% higher than the price of a blue tie. He paid $200 for the blue ties, which were $40 each. How much did he pay for all the ties in total?""

Answer in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:
John bought the blue ties for $200, with each tie costing $40. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John bought red ties more than twice the number of blue ties, and the price of a red tie is 50% higher than the price of a blue tie, the price of a red tie is:
\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Let's assume John bought \( n \) red ties, where \( n > 2 \times 5 = 10 \). Since the exact number of red ties is not specified, we can assume the smallest integer greater than 10, which is 11. Therefore, the total cost for the red ties is:
\[
11 \times 60 = 660 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost for all the ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:
\[
200 + 660 = 860 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount John paid for all the ties is:
\[
\boxed{860}

mgsm-th-48,"Translation: Tracey uses a wire that is 4 feet long to support a tomato plant in the garden by cutting the wire into pieces that are 6 inches each. How many pieces of wire will she have in total?

To determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from a 4-foot wire, we need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 4-foot wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of wire Tracey will have is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,8
mgsm-th-49,"Translation: Richard lives in a high apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor has 8 units, and 3/4 of all units are occupied. How many units are unoccupied?

To find the total number of units, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is $\boxed{30}$.",30,30
mgsm-th-50,"Translation: Lloyd has a chicken farm where his chickens lay 252 eggs per day. He sells them at $2 per dozen. How much income does Lloyd make per week from the eggs?

To determine how long it took Tom to sail back, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Tom traveled during the first part of his trip.
2. Use the distance to find out how long it took him to travel back.

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled from 13:00 to 16:00. The time he spent sailing is 3 hours (from 13:00 to 16:00).

The distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took him to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time taken is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles per hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the time it took Tom to sail back is \(\boxed{5}\) hours.",5,5

mgsm-th-56,"Translation: Peter intends to go see a movie this week. He usually buys a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If this week he has $42, how many times can he go see a movie?

To determine how many times Peter can go see a movie, we need to calculate the total cost for one movie and popcorn session and then see how many such sessions he can afford with his $42.

The cost for one movie and popcorn session is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this amount with his $42. We do this by dividing his total money by the cost of one session:

First, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers at the cheaper rate (2 flowers for $1):
- The number of bouquets needed is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
- The total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers at the more expensive rate (3 flowers for $2.50):
- The number of bouquets needed is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
- The total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two rates:
- The savings is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent will save \(\boxed{6}\) dollars.",6,6

The original cost of the haircut is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by $100 \times 0.30 = $30. Therefore, the final cost is $100 - $30 = $70. So, the dog's hair cutting will cost $\\boxed{70}$.",70,70
mgsm-th-80,"Translation: Two girls each took 1/6 of 24 liters of water. Then, another boy took 6 liters. How many liters of water are left?

First, we calculate the amount of water each girl took:
\[ \text{Water taken by each girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water taken by the girls is:
\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we add the amount of water taken by the boy:
\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:
\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Let's denote the number of matches won by the team as \( W \) and the number of matches lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of matches played is 22, so we have the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more matches than they lost, so we have the equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the football team won a total of \( \boxed{15} \) matches.",15,15

If Silvia has worked at the company for five years, including December last year, how much will her total annual salary be after working for three more years?

Answer: After working for three more years, Silvia's salary will be increased by 10% each year. Let's calculate her salary step by step.

1. **Initial Salary**: $600 per month
2. **After 1 year**: $600 * 1.10 = $660 per month
3. **After 2 years**: $660 * 1.10 = $726 per month

If Lee can run 400 meters over the fence in 38 seconds, how many seconds can Gerald, after changing his eating habits, run 400 meters over the fence?

Answer: First, we find Gerald's original time to run 400 meters. Since Lee is 2 seconds faster, Gerald's original time is 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds. After changing his eating habits, Gerald becomes 10% faster. This means his new time is 90% of his original time. So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds * 0.9 = 36 seconds.

To calculate the profit, we first need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. An increase of 150% means the value of the house is now 250% of its original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repair costs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:

If there are 20 chickens in Wendy's coop, how many cups of feed should she give in the last meal of the day?

To find out how many cups of feed Wendy should give in the last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon, and then determine how much is left for the evening meal.

First, calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

After the 4 hours, how far from home was he?

Answer: First, calculate the distance John initially drove: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles/hour} = 180 \text{ miles}\). Then, he drove back the same distance, so he was back at his starting point after 3 hours. In the next 2 hours, he was stuck in traffic, so he didn't move. After 2.5 hours, he started driving again at 30 miles per hour. He had 1.5 hours left, so he drove \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 45 \text{ miles}\). In the last 1 hour, he drove at 80 miles per hour, so he drove another \(1 \text{ hour} \times 80 \text{ miles/hour} = 80 \text{ miles}\).

To solve this, let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as \( x \).

1. She sold one third of the green-homed vacuum cleaners, so she has \( \frac{2}{3}x \) left.
2. She then sold 2 more from the red-homed ones, so she has \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) left.
3. She sold half of the remaining from the orange-homed ones, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \) left.
4. We know that after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
5. To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10
   \]
6. Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 12

7. Multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   x = 18

mgsm-th-15,"Translation: A merchant has to choose between two plans: buying jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic equipment worth $8,000. His financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% and the electronic equipment market will increase by 1.2% within the same month. If the merchant wants to choose the plan that will yield the highest profit by the end of the month, how much profit will the merchant make in dollars?

Answer: To determine which plan yields the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each plan after the predicted increase in value.

For the jewelry plan:
- Initial value: $5,000
- Increase: 2.5%
- New value: $5,000 * (1 + 2.5/100) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
- Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronic equipment plan:
- Initial value: $8,000
- Increase: 1.2%
- New value: $8,000 * (1 + 1.2/100) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
- Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits, the jewelry plan yields a higher profit of $125 compared to the electronic equipment plan which yields a profit of $96.

Therefore, the merchant will make $\boxed{125}$ dollars in profit by choosing the jewelry plan.",125,125

To find John's running speed in miles per hour, we first need to determine the total time he spends running each week.

On the first day, John runs for 3 hours. For the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours per day. Therefore, the total time he runs on the other two days is \( 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \) hours.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Denara's walking and running speeds and then calculate the distance she can cover in the given time.

1. Determine Denara's walking and running speeds:
   - Walking and jumping speed = 3 miles per hour
   - Running speed = 4 times the walking and jumping speed = \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles per hour
   - Walking speed = half of the running speed = \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) miles per hour

2. Calculate the time spent running and walking:
   - Total time = 6 hours
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours
   - Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours

3. Calculate the distance covered while running and walking:
   - Distance covered while running = running speed \(\times\) time spent running = \(12 \times 2 = 24\) miles
   - Distance covered while walking = walking speed \(\times\) time spent walking = \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles

4. Calculate the total distance covered:
   - Total distance = distance covered while running + distance covered while walking = \(24 + 24 = 48\) miles

Therefore, the total distance Denara can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{48}\) miles.",48,18

Pirk, the Great Dragon, is sitting on Farbo Mountain. It can burn everything within a 1000-foot radius with its fire breath. Polly can throw a golden spear, the only weapon known to defeat a dragon, up to 400 feet. This distance is within the range of the dragon's fire. However, if Polly holds a pyre ruby, she can throw the golden spear three times farther. How far can Polly stand from the dragon's fire while still being able to throw the golden spear to the dragon?

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$.

First, we know that without the pyre ruby, Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet. With the pyre ruby, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the new throwing distance is:

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:

First, calculate the total number of calories available for consumption:

Total daily calorie goal: 2000 calories
Calories already consumed: 1800 calories

Calories available for consumption: \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories

Next, determine how many calories one serving of fried potato chips provides:

1 serving = 250 calories

Now, calculate how many servings of fried potato chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories:

Number of servings: \(\frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings}\)

Since 300 grams of fried potato chips contain 5 servings, calculate the number of grams per serving:

Grams per serving: \(\frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams/serving}\)

Finally, determine how many grams of fried potato chips you can eat with 0.8 servings:

Grams of fried potato chips: \(0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams}\)

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the beeswax and wicks needed to make 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees per year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Calculate the net increase in the number of trees per year.
The net increase per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
The total number of trees after 10 years is the initial number of trees plus the net increase over 10 years. So, we have:

On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday. How many cakes did she buy in total over the three days?

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times as many cakes as on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times as many cakes as on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

""A twenty-dozen cup has a price that is $1,200 less than the total price of half a dozen plates sold at $6,000 per plate. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.""

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total price of half a dozen plates.
2. Determine the price of twenty-dozen cups.
3. Calculate the price of one cup.

First, calculate the total price of half a dozen plates:
\[
\text{Price of half a dozen plates} = 6000 \times 6 = 36000
\]

Next, determine the price of twenty-dozen cups. According to the problem, the price of twenty-dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total price of half a dozen plates:
\[
\text{Price of twenty-dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800
\]

Now, calculate the price of one cup. Since twenty-dozen cups are 240 cups, the price of one cup is:
\[
\text{Price of one cup} = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
\]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:

Sara babysits for her neighbors 4 times and earns $5 per time. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Before she started babysitting, Sara had $10 saved up. How many times does Sara need to mow the lawn to be able to buy the jacket and the shoes?

To answer this question, we first calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- Jacket: $30
- Two pairs of shoes: $20 * 2 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Sara already has $10 saved up. Therefore, she needs an additional $70 - $10 = $60.

Sara earns $5 for each time she babysits and $4 for each time she mows the lawn. She has babysat 4 times, so she has earned $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

The remaining amount she needs to earn is $60 - $20 = $40. Since she earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn $\boxed{10}$ times.",10,10

""Jerry has a flock of chickens. Red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, while white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?""

To solve the problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is 2 more than the number of red chickens.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \)
2. \( w = r + 2 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( w \):
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

To find out how many hours Gary will spend walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Gary to walk this distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) taken to walk a distance \(d\) at a speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:

On the second day, Dolphine counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Let's denote the number of customers counted on the third day as \( x \).

The total number of customers over the three days is 100 (first day) + 150 (second day) + \( x \) (third day) = 500.

So, we have the equation: \( 100 + 150 + x = 500 \).

Solving for \( x \):

\( 250 + x = 500 \)

\( x = 500 - 250 \)

Now, the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool. How much water is currently in the smaller pool?

To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Then, the amount of water in the larger pool 4 minutes ago would be \( 2x \) gallons.

Since the water is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water. Therefore, the amount of water in the smaller pool now is \( x - 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the larger pool now is \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 2x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2x = -48 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the smaller pool had 24 gallons of water. Since 4 minutes have passed and the pool has lost 16 gallons, the current amount of water in the smaller pool is:
\[ 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Therefore, the current amount of water in the smaller pool is \(\boxed{8}\) gallons.",8,8

\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be repaid is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Jeanelle will pay over 12 months:

On Tuesday, Caley collected twice as many seashells as she collected on Monday. How many seashells did Caley collect on Tuesday?

To solve the problem, we start by determining how many seashells Robert collected on Monday. Let's denote the number of seashells Robert collected on Monday as \( R \). According to the problem, Caley collected 20 more seashells than Robert, which is 5 times the amount Robert collected. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ C = R + 20 \]
\[ C = 5R \]

Since both expressions are equal to \( C \), we can set them equal to each other:

\[ R + 20 = 5R \]

Subtract \( R \) from both sides:

\[ 20 = 4R \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ R = 5 \]

So, Robert collected 5 seashells on Monday. Since Caley collected 20 more seashells than Robert, we can find the number of seashells Caley collected on Monday:

\[ C = 5 + 20 = 25 \]

On Tuesday, Caley collected twice as many seashells as she collected on Monday. Therefore, the number of seashells Caley collected on Tuesday is:

Steve decided to eat more tomatoes and decided to grow cherry tomatoes himself. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend, eating 6 tomatoes a day. If one tomato plant produces 3 tomatoes per week, how many plants does he need to grow?

To determine how many tomato plants Steve needs to grow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tomatoes Steve eats per week.
2. Determine how many tomato plants are needed to produce that many tomatoes per week.

First, we know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day. Therefore, the number of tomatoes he eats per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Next, we know that one tomato plant produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many plants are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week by the number of tomatoes one plant produces per week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/plant/week}} = 14 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, Steve needs to grow \(\boxed{14}\) plants.",14,21

Each customer's house will need 2 bottles of bleach and one pack of cleaning cloths. The bleach costs $2 per bottle and the pack of cleaning cloths costs $5. His expenses are only these. He calculates that he will have a total income of $92 per week. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. So, how much profit will he make per week?

Answer: To find out how much profit Kim will make per week, we need to calculate his total expenses first. Each customer needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cleaning cloths. The cost for one customer is $2 * 2 + $5 = $9. With 8 customers (3 existing + 5 potential), the total cost is $9 * 8 = $72.

To find out how many oranges John can harvest in one year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of orange trees in the grove.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest in one year.
3. Calculate the total number of oranges harvested in one year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of orange trees.
John has 10 hectares, and each hectare has 100 orange trees.
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ trees/hectare} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Step 2: Determine how many times John can harvest in one year.
There are 4 harvests in one year (since he harvests every 3 months).
\[ 12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of oranges harvested in one year.
If each tree produces the same amount of oranges and we assume each tree produces the same number of oranges per harvest, then the total number of oranges harvested in one year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ oranges/year} \]

Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees half of all the bees that have gone out return to the hive. She then sees twice the number of bees that she initially saw exit the hive in the next 6 hours fly out of the hive. Finally, all the bees that had gone out earlier and had not yet returned come back to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Answer: In the last 6 hours, Debra saw 120 bees return to the hive.

To solve this, we can break it down step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees exit the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of all the bees that have gone out return. Since 30 bees initially went out, half of them (15 bees) return.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice the number of bees that initially went out fly out. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees fly out.
4. Finally, all the bees that had gone out earlier and had not yet returned come back. Since 60 bees flew out in the last 6 hours and 15 bees had already returned, the number of bees that had not yet returned is 60 - 15 = 45 bees. These 45 bees plus the 15 bees that had already returned in the previous 6 hours make a total of 45 + 15 = 60 bees returning in the last 6 hours.

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

Steve is 3 miles from school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim is 2 miles from school and can ride a skateboard at 264 feet per minute. The winner will wait at home for how long before the loser arrives at the finish line in the competition?

To answer the question, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel from school to home and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to travel 3 miles:
1 mile = 5280 feet, so 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.
Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to travel 3 miles is:
\[ \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to travel 2 miles:
2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.
Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to travel 2 miles is:
\[ \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in their travel times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

How much money did Shaneeda earn that day?

Answer: First, calculate the earnings from the bicycle tires:
- 5 bicycles with 2 tires each: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires
- Cost per tire: 25 cents = $0.25
- Total from bicycles: \(10 \times 0.25 = 2.50\) dollars

Next, calculate the earnings from the tricycle tires:

After that, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, and an ant carried away the last piece, leaving five pieces. How many pieces of French fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?

Answer: Let's denote the total number of French fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 pieces, so \( x - 14 \) pieces were left.
2. The owl ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 pieces, so \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) pieces were left.
3. Three crows each ate 3 pieces, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) pieces were eaten by the crows, leaving \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) pieces.
4. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \) pieces were stolen, leaving \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \) pieces.
5. An ant carried away the last piece, leaving 5 pieces, so \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of a bag of glass balls after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]
So, the price will increase 18 times.

The price increase can be modeled by the formula for compound interest:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( P \) is the final price, \( P_0 \) is the initial price, \( r \) is the rate of increase per period, and \( n \) is the number of periods.

Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[ P = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brook's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brook, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brook's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age:

Billy takes about 1.5 minutes to peel a potato but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take Billy to prepare all the potatoes?

To find out how long it will take Billy to prepare all the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting.

First, calculate the total time for peeling:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 1.5 \text{ minutes per potato} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the total time for cutting:

To solve this, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then use the profit to find the number of gallons of lemons they bought.

1. Calculate the total revenue:
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.

2. Calculate the total cost:
   - The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

If Sed earns $6000 per month, how much money will he have left after deducting all expenses and donations?

To solve this, let's break down Sed's expenses and calculate the remaining amount step by step.

1. **Rent**: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \) dollars
2. **Car fuel**: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \) dollars
3. **Total spent on rent and car fuel**: \( 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \) dollars
4. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**: \( 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \) dollars

Sandra threatened to change suppliers if Fred does not deliver the missing red roses by 5 PM to ensure the continuation of her business. How many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 PM?

To find out how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to determine the number of white carnations first. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Jean is two years older than Marc. Two years ago, Marc's age was more than half of Jean's age plus 5 years. If Jean is currently 30 years old, how old is Marc?

Answer:
Given that Jean is currently 30 years old, we can denote Jean's current age as \( J = 30 \).

Two years ago, Jean's age was \( J - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 \).

Let's denote Marc's current age as \( M \). Two years ago, Marc's age was \( M - 2 \).

According to the problem, two years ago, Marc's age was more than half of Jean's age plus 5 years. This can be written as:
\[ M - 2 > \frac{28}{2} + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 > 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 > 19 \]
\[ M > 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Marc, we can write:
\[ J = M + 2 \]
\[ 30 = M + 2 \]
\[ M = 30 - 2 \]
\[ M = 28 \]

We need to check if this value satisfies the condition \( M - 2 > 19 \):

The other team is less skilled; the first runner of this team will run 400 meters in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner will run 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Given this information, how many seconds ahead will the faster team finish compared to the other team?

Answer in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:
To determine the probability that Jerry will throw a number greater than 3, we first identify the favorable outcomes. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Expressing this as a percentage, we get:
\[
0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Next, we determine the probability that Jerry will throw two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, the probability of throwing an even number on a single throw is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Since the throws are independent, the probability of throwing two even numbers in a row is:
\[
0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]
Expressing this as a percentage, we get:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Now, we compare the two probabilities. The probability of throwing a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the probability of throwing two even numbers in a row is 25%. The difference in probability is:
\[
50\% - 25\% = 25\%

Thus, the probability that Jerry will throw a number greater than 3 is higher than the probability that he will throw two even numbers in a row by $\\boxed{25\%}$.",25,25

Apart from this, he does not distribute hay in the store. If he distributes 160 strands of hay to all the small gnawing animals, how many mice are in each cage?

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many mice are in each cage. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hay given to hamsters:**
   \[
   \text{Total hay for hamsters} = 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ strands per hamster} = 50 \text{ strands}

   \]

4. **Determine the number of mice in each cage:**
   \[
   \text{Number of mice per cage} = \frac{90 \text{ strands}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 30 \text{ mice per cage}

To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount Mandi will owe after 3 months with the given interest rate.

The formula to calculate the total amount after interest is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]

Here, the principal is $100, the interest rate is 2% per month, and the number of periods is 3 months.

First, convert the interest rate to a decimal:
\[ 2\% = 0.02 \]

Now, plug the values into the formula:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 \times (1.02)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.02)^3 \):
\[ (1.02)^3 = 1.061208 \]

Now, multiply by the principal:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Each can of tomatoes she uses has a volume of 16 ounces and contains three tomatoes. The latest tomato sauce Frieda made has a volume of 32 ounces. How many tomatoes did Frieda use in total?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cans of tomatoes Frieda used and then calculate the total number of tomatoes.

1. **Determine the number of cans used:**
   - Each can of tomatoes has a volume of 16 ounces.
   - The sauce Frieda made has a volume of 32 ounces.
   - Since the volume of tomatoes decreases by half when used, the effective volume of tomatoes used is 32 ounces.
   - Therefore, the number of cans used is:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 2 \text{ cans}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Frieda used 2 cans.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 6 \text{ tomatoes}

Next, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:

\[
\frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
\]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time to cover 14 segments is:

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:
To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first calculate the total time he spent watching TV on the other days of the week.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watches 1 hour each day, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watches 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watches 2 hours.

Adding these together, the total time spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is:

After baking the cookies, he realized he made 15 more cookies than needed. He dropped 5 cookies while taking them out to cool down, and now he has 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wants to bake twice as many cookies, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies.
3. After baking, he realized he made 15 more cookies than needed, so the number of cookies he actually has is \( 2x + 15 \).
4. He dropped 5 cookies while cooling them down, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. We know that he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110

6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110

If both of them ate all the dried fruit rolls, how much did they eat on average?""

To find out how much they ate on average, we need to calculate the total area of the dried fruit rolls and then divide by the number of people.

First, calculate the area of Beatrice's dried fruit rolls:
\[
\text{Area of Beatrice's roll} = 24 \, \text{cm} \times 14 \, \text{cm} = 336 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Next, calculate the area of Marcelle's dried fruit rolls:
\[

Now, find the total area of all the dried fruit rolls:
\[
\text{Total area} = 336 \, \text{cm}^2 + 72 \, \text{cm}^2 = 408 \, \text{cm}^2

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$.

First, let's determine Lila's salary four years ago. Since Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000 and it was 30% more than Lila's salary, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Adrian's salary} = \text{Lila's salary} \times 1.30 \]
\[ 40000 = \text{Lila's salary} \times 1.30 \]
\[ \text{Lila's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

Now, let's calculate Adrian's salary four years later. Adrian's salary increased by 40% from $40,000:
\[ \text{Adrian's new salary} = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

Since both salaries increased by the same percentage, Lila's salary four years later is:
\[ \text{Lila's new salary} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \]

The total salary that both received four years later is:

mgsm-th-124,"Translation: Jenny is helping at her mother's office. She has 60 letters that need stamps and one pile of letters that already have stamps. She stamps one third of the letters that need stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile that already have stamps, how many letters were in that pile when Jenny started?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters Jenny started with in the pile that already had stamps. Let's denote the number of letters in the pile that already had stamps when Jenny started as \( x \).

Jenny stamps one third of the 60 letters that need stamps. So, she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters. After stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile that already have stamps is the original number of letters plus the 20 letters she just stamped. This total is given as 30 letters.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 30 - 20 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile that already had stamps when Jenny started is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10

To find out how much money Dillon will have to pay, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the cost of one watermelon. Since one watermelon costs three times as much as one bell pepper, and one bell pepper costs $15, the cost of one watermelon is:
\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 4 watermelons:
\[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, the cost of one orange is:

""One hospital sees 500 patients per day. Each patient is treated on average for 24 minutes. The doctor charges the hospital $150 per hour and the hospital charges the patient $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these patients?""

To answer the question, we need to calculate the profit per patient and then multiply by the number of patients.

1. Calculate the time each patient takes in hours:
   \[
   \text{Time per patient} = \frac{24 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the charge from the patient:
   \[
   \text{Charge from patient} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars per hour} = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the charge to the hospital:
   \[
   \text{Charge to hospital} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars per hour} = 60 \text{ dollars}

Then, 10 more elves quit from the remaining number after being kicked in the face by children. How many elves are left?

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of elves who quit after being splashed with vomit.
2. Determine the number of elves remaining after the first group quit.
3. Subtract the 10 elves who quit after being kicked.
4. Find the final number of elves left.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many video games Bryan has after losing 5 items. Originally, Bryan has 5 items, but he lost 5 items, so he has 0 items left. However, the problem states that after losing 5 items, Bryan now has 20 video games. This means Bryan originally had 25 video games (20 + 5).

Next, we need to determine how many video games Bob has. According to the problem, Bob has fewer video games than 3 times the number of video games that Bryan has. Since Bryan now has 20 video games, 3 times this number is \(3 \times 20 = 60\). Therefore, Bob has fewer than 60 video games. The exact number of video games Bob has is not specified, but we know it is less than 60. Since the problem does not provide a specific number for Bob's video games, we can only state that Bob has fewer than 60 video games.

However, if we assume the problem is asking for the maximum possible number of video games Bob could have, which is just less than 60, we can say Bob has 59 video games.

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

1. Determine the cost per cup of yogurt.
2. Calculate the total number of cups Terry consumes in 30 days.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cups consumed.

First, we find the cost per cup of yogurt. Since 4 cups of yogurt cost $5.00, the cost per cup is:

To solve this, we first calculate the total money John gets from selling the Lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games:

Answer in English and enclose the final number in \boxed{}:
To find John's running speed in miles per hour, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the distance John runs on the first day:
\[ \text{Distance on the first day} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance John runs on the other two days. Since he runs for half the time of the first day on these days, he runs for:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
So, the distance he runs on each of these two days is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \]

The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances he runs on each day:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} + 1.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} + 1.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} + 3 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} + 4.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \]

We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles, so:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} = 60 \text{ miles} \]
Solving for speed, we get:
\[ \text{speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} = 8 \text{ miles per hour} \]

She cut each tray into 8 pieces and placed these five trays on the buffet table for guests to serve themselves. After the party, there were 14 pie pieces left. How many pie pieces did the guests take?

To find out how many pie pieces the guests took, we first calculate the total number of pie pieces baked. Since there are 5 trays and each tray is cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pie pieces is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

After the party, there were 14 pie pieces left. Therefore, the number of pie pieces taken by the guests is the total number of pie pieces minus the number of pie pieces left:

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

So, the guests took \(\boxed{26}\) pie pieces.",26,26

""From the nutritional data, a bag of fried potatoes provides 250 calories per serving. If a 300-gram bag of fried potatoes has 5 servings, how many grams of fried potatoes can you eat in the case where your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories?""

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:
First, calculate the number of calories provided by one serving of fried potatoes:
\[ \text{Calories per serving} = 250 \, \text{calories} \]

Next, determine the number of servings in a 300-gram bag:
\[ \text{Servings per bag} = 5 \]

Now, calculate the total calories in a 300-gram bag:
\[ \text{Total calories per bag} = 5 \times 250 = 1250 \, \text{calories} \]

Given the daily calorie target and the calories already consumed, find the remaining calories available:
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \, \text{calories} \]

Determine how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories:
\[ \text{Servings available} = \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \, \text{servings} \]

Finally, calculate the grams of fried potatoes that can be eaten with 0.8 servings:
\[ \text{Grams per serving} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \, \text{grams} \]
\[ \text{Grams available} = 0.8 \times 60 = 48 \, \text{grams} \]

Thus, you can eat $\boxed{48}$ grams of fried potatoes.",48,48
polymath-low-th-44,"Translation: Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. One pound of beeswax can make 10 candles. A pound of beeswax with candle wicks costs $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, how much net profit will he make if he sells 20 candles?

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue.**
Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. If he sells 20 candles, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost.**
One pound of beeswax can make 10 candles. Therefore, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**
The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars.",20,20

On average, one blog post takes her 4 hours to research and write. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. Calculate the total hours she spent writing articles over these three days.

To solve this, we need to find out how many articles she wrote each day and then calculate the total hours spent.

1. **Monday:**
   - Articles: 5

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Articles: \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\)

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Articles: \(2 \times 7 = 14\)

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total time spent is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

If she has 23 post-it notes left, how many post-it notes were in the pack she bought?

Answer: Initially, Candice had 80 post-it notes. She used one post-it note per 220 coffee cups, so she used 220 post-it notes. If she has 23 post-it notes left, the total number of post-it notes she had before using any is 220 (used) + 23 (left) = 243.

To solve this, first, we determine the number of blue ties John bought:
\[ \text{Price per blue tie} = \$40 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for blue ties} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we find the price of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties:
\[ \text{Price of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost for red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John paid:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for all the ties is $\boxed{800}$.",800,800

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the units are occupied, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:

If he built a 4-level sandcastle with the top level having an area of 16 square feet, what would the average area of each level be in square feet?

To find the average area of each level, we need to determine the area of each level and then find the average.

Let's denote the area of the top level as \( A_1 = 16 \) square feet. The area of the second level is \( A_2 = 16 + 0.5 = 16.5 \) square feet. The area of the third level is \( A_3 = 16.5 + 0.5 = 17 \) square feet. The area of the fourth level is \( A_4 = 17 + 0.5 = 17.5 \) square feet.

Now, we calculate the average area of the four levels:
\[
\text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{16 + 16.5 + 17 + 17.5}{4} = \frac{67}{4} = 16.75

To determine how much money Vincent will save, we need to calculate the cost of 18 flowers at both rates and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers at the cheaper rate:
- The cheaper rate is $1 for 2 flowers.
- To find out how many bouquets of 2 flowers are in 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers at the cheaper rate is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers at the more expensive rate:
- The more expensive rate is $2.50 for 3 flowers.
- To find out how many bouquets of 3 flowers are in 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers at the more expensive rate is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we find the difference between the cost at the more expensive rate and the cost at the cheaper rate:
\[
15 - 9 = 6 \text{ dollars}

To answer the question, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog to spread over the 42 miles to the city.

1. The fog spreads 3 miles in 10 minutes.
2. To find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles, we divide 42 by 3:
   \[

On Monday and Tuesday, he watches his favorite show, each episode of which is one hour long, one episode per night. On Wednesday, he watches a show with each episode being 30 minutes long for a few episodes. On Thursday, after finishing his homework quickly, he watches one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute episode of his favorite show. On Friday, since he can stay up late due to the weekend, he watches two 1-hour episodes of his favorite show. If he watches TV for a total of 7 hours, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

To solve this, we need to calculate the total time Franky spends watching TV each day and then determine how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

- Monday and Tuesday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Wednesday: \(x \times 30 \text{ minutes} = x \times 0.5 \text{ hours}\)

After baking, he realized he made 15 more cookies than needed. He dropped 5 cookies while taking them out to cool down, and now he has 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cookies Henry baked this year before accounting for the 15 extra cookies and the 5 dropped cookies.
2. Subtract the 15 extra cookies and the 5 dropped cookies from the total number of cookies he has now to find the number of cookies he baked this year.
3. Since he wants to make twice as many cookies this year as he did last year, divide the number of cookies he baked this year by 2 to find the number of cookies he baked last year.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Henry has 110 cookies now. He dropped 5 cookies and had 15 extra cookies, so the number of cookies he baked this year before these adjustments is:
   \[
   110 + 5 - 15 = 100
   \]
2. Since 100 cookies is twice the number of cookies he baked last year, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

If both of them eat all the dried fruit rolls, how much do they eat on average?

To find the average amount of dried fruit rolls eaten by Marcelle and Beatriz, we first need to calculate the area of each roll.

The area of Beatriz's roll is:
\[ 24 \text{ cm} \times 14 \text{ cm} = 336 \text{ cm}^2 \]

The area of Marcelle's roll is:
\[ 3 \text{ cm} \times 24 \text{ cm} = 72 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Since both Marcelle and Beatriz eat all the dried fruit rolls, the total area of the dried fruit rolls is:
\[ 336 \text{ cm}^2 + 72 \text{ cm}^2 = 408 \text{ cm}^2 \]

The average amount of dried fruit rolls eaten by each person is:

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in \boxed{}:
First, we need to determine how many ten-foot segments Julia will paddle in 64 seconds. Since Julia takes 10.5 seconds to paddle 20 feet, we can calculate the number of 20-foot segments in 64 seconds:
\[

\]
Since Julia can only paddle complete segments, we take the integer part, which is 121 segments of 20 feet. Each segment of 20 feet results in 2 liters of water entering the boat. Therefore, the total amount of water that will enter the boat is:
\[
121 \times 2 = 242 \text{ liters}

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:
First, we determine how many photos Brittanie's phone can store. Since Jamal's phone can store 1,800 photos and this is 6 times the capacity of Brittanie's phone, we calculate the capacity of Brittanie's phone as follows:
\[
\text{Brittanie's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \text{ photos}
\]
Next, we know that Brittanie's phone can store photos of up to 50 times the number of ducks in the duck photo that Jamal took in the zoo. Therefore, the number of ducks in the photo is:
\[
\text{Number of ducks} = \frac{300}{50} = 6

Since she had some wood scraps left, she decided to sell them. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 wood scraps that she bought for $10 each, and five 4 x 4 x 10 wood scraps that she bought for $16 each. If she sells all the wood scraps, how much profit will she make?

To calculate the profit, we need to know the selling price of the wood scraps. However, the selling price is not provided in the question. Assuming the selling price is the same as the purchase price, we can calculate the total cost and then determine the profit based on the selling price.

First, calculate the total cost of the wood scraps:
- For the 2 x 4 x 10 wood scraps: \(10 \text{ pieces} \times \$10/\text{piece} = \$100\)
- For the 4 x 4 x 10 wood scraps: \(5 \text{ pieces} \times \$16/\text{piece} = \$80\)
- Total cost: \(\$100 + \$80 = \$180\)

If Sasha sells all the wood scraps at the same price she bought them, her total revenue will be the same as her total cost, which is \$180. Therefore, her profit is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$180 - \$180 = \$0 \]

However, if the selling price is different, we need that information to calculate the exact profit. Since the selling price is not provided, we assume the selling price is the same as the purchase price, and thus the profit is:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Kate used. We know the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13 and the total number of units (teaspoons of sugar + glasses of water) is 120.

Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar by \(7x\) and the number of glasses of water by \(13x\). According to the problem, the total number of units is 120, so we can write the equation:
\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoons of sugar, which is \(7x\):

Answer in English and enclose the final number in $\\boxed{}$:
First, we calculate Lila's monthly salary four years ago. Since Adrian's salary was $40,000 and it was 30% more than Lila's, we can set up the equation:
\[ 40000 = 1.3 \times \text{Lila's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lila's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrian's salary four years later. Adrian's salary increased by 40% from $40,000:
\[ \text{Adrian's new salary} = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lila's salary four years later. Since both salaries increased together by the same percentage, Lila's salary also increased by 40%:
\[ \text{Lila's new salary} = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we calculate the total monthly salary of both Adrian and Lila four years later:
\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total monthly salary that both received four years later is $\\boxed{99076.92}$.",92,95200

He responds kindly, able to write one page every 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing per week?

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of letters Mike receives per week:

- He has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.
- Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week.
- Therefore, he receives a total of 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Next, we calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response:

- Each letter is 5 pages long.
- Therefore, he needs to write 6 * 5 = 30 pages per week.

Now, we calculate the time it takes for him to write these pages:

- He can write one page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, to write 30 pages, he needs 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

So, he spends $\\boxed{3}$ hours writing per week.",3,3

To solve the problem, let's denote the number of fish in each tank as \( x \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two tanks is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both tanks combined. Since the two tanks have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both tanks is:
\[ 2x \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2x \]
\[ 28 = 4x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

If one cookie provides 200 calories, how many more calories does Zukin get from eating cookies compared to her sister?""

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in \(\boxed{}\):
First, calculate the number of cookies Zukin ate on Monday and Tuesday:
- On Monday, Zukin ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Zukin ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Zukin ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Zukin ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.
- Therefore, Zukin ate a total of \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, calculate the number of cookies Zukin's sister ate on Monday and Tuesday:
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so her sister ate a total of \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

Now, calculate the calories Zukin and her sister consumed:
- Each cookie provides 200 calories.
- Zukin consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.
- Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

If there are a total of 20 chickens in Wendy's coop, how many cups of food does she need to feed the chickens in the last meal of the day?

To find out how many cups of food Wendy needs to feed the chickens in the last meal of the day, we first calculate the total amount of food she has already given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon.

Total cups of food given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since each chicken gets 3 cups of food, the total amount of food for 20 chickens is:

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Tulu. Since Tulu has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 80 sheep, Tulu has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

Now, we add the number of sheep in Tulu, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep. So, the total number of sheep is \( 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \).

Thus, the total number of sheep in Tulu, Charleston, and Seattle is \(\boxed{260}\).",260,260

After downloading 40% of the file, Windows forces her to restart and install an update which takes 20 minutes. After the update, Karl has to start downloading the file from the beginning again. How many minutes does Karl spend downloading the entire file?

To solve this, we first calculate the time Karl spends downloading 40% of the file:
- 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB.
- At a rate of 2 GB per minute, it takes \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes to download 80 GB.

After downloading 80 GB, Karl has to restart and install an update, which takes 20 minutes. So, the total time so far is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) minutes.

After the update, Karl has to start downloading the file from the beginning again. The total size of the file is 200 GB, and it takes \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) minutes to download the entire file.

In the remaining time, he drove at 80 miles per hour. After 4 hours, how far was he from home?

Answer: First, let's calculate the distance John initially drove away from home. He drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so the distance is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) miles.

Next, he turned back and had to stop for 2 hours. After that, he drove for 0.5 hours at 30 miles per hour, covering \(0.5 \times 30 = 15\) miles. He then drove for the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour, covering \(1.5 \times 80 = 120\) miles.

So, the total distance he covered on his way back is \(15 + 120 = 135\) miles. Since he initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home after 4 hours is \(180 - 135 = 45\) miles.

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to calculate the annual profit and then determine how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of the trees.

First, calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
\[ \text{Annual revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons/tree} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per tree per year} \]

Next, calculate the annual cost of watering and fertilizing each tree:

Now, calculate the annual profit from each tree:
\[ \text{Annual profit} = \text{Annual revenue} - \text{Annual cost} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per tree per year} \]

Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of the trees, which is $90. To find out how many years it will take to cover this cost, we divide the initial cost by the annual profit:

If Melany has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have at first?

To solve the problem, let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as \( x \).

1. Melany sold one third of the green-homed vacuum cleaners, so she has \( \frac{2}{3}x \) left.
2. She then sold 2 more from the red-homed ones, so she has \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) left.
3. She sold half of the remaining from the yellow-homed ones, so she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \) left.
4. We know that after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5

6. Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 12

polymath-low-th-18,"Translation: Clare makes an omelet with 3 eggs every morning. In 4 weeks, how many dozens of eggs will she eat?

To determine how many dozens of eggs Clare will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in 4 weeks.
2. Determine the total number of eggs Clare will consume.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

First, we know that there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, the number of days is:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \text{ days} \]

Next, Clare makes an omelet with 3 eggs every morning. So, the total number of eggs she will consume in 28 days is:
\[ 28 \times 3 = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84}{12} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Thus, the number of dozens of eggs Clare will eat in 4 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]",7,7

""Marissa hikes a 12-mile trail. She hikes the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, how fast (in miles per hour) does she need to hike the remaining distance?""

To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to hike the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, determine the time Marissa has already spent hiking:
\[
\text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Calculate the remaining time she has to hike the remaining distance:
\[
\text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

The remaining distance to be hiked is:
\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[
\text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, Marissa needs to hike the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour.",6,6

However, while I am pouring the orange juice, I accidentally spill one liter. How much water will be left in the 24 liters of fruit drink that remains?""

Answer the question in English and enclose the final number in \(\boxed{}\):

First, calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange juice:
\[ \text{Water in orange juice} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of passion fruit juice:
\[ \text{Water in passion fruit juice} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Since 1 liter of orange juice was spilled, the amount of orange juice left is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water left in the 9 liters of orange juice is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Now, calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of fruit drink:
\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water left in the 24 liters of fruit drink is:

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract 23 from it.

First, we calculate Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old, so the number of years ago that Raymond's son was born is:

""Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50, which was 25% off the original price. What was the original price of the book in dollars?""

To find the original price, we need to determine what the price would be before the 25% discount was applied. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Since the book was sold at a 25% discount, Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book is \(\boxed{26}\) dollars.",26,26

To find out how much Michka spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the shorts, the pants, and the shoes.

First, calculate the total cost of the shorts:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the pants:

Answer: First, we calculate how many scoops Synthia eats in 60 days. Since she eats one scoop every night, in 60 days she will have eaten 60 scoops.

Next, we determine how many boxes of ice cream she needs to buy. Since each box contains 15 scoops, we divide the total number of scoops by the number of scoops per box:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ scoops}}{15 \text{ scoops/box}} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $4.00, so for 4 boxes, the total cost is:

To answer the question, we need to determine the distance between Henry's two stopping points. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Henry stopped the first time after cycling 20 miles.
2. Henry stopped the second time 15 miles before reaching the end of his 60-mile trip. Therefore, he stopped the second time at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to find the distance between the two stopping points. The first stopping point was at 20 miles, and the second stopping point was at 45 miles. The distance between these two points is:
\[45 - 20 = 25\]

So, the distance between the two stopping points is \(\boxed{25}\) miles.",25,25

But she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together are cheaper than the boots by $5. If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much as the first one, how much will the boots cost?

To find the cost of the boots, we first need to calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is $33 \times 2 = $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of high heels together are $5 cheaper than the boots, the cost of the boots is $99 + $5 = $104.

Thus, the boots will cost \(\boxed{104}\) dollars.",104,104

""The age difference between Darrel and Allen is in the ratio 7:11. If the combined current age of both is 162 years, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.""

To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrel and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrel's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrel and Allen. Darrel's current age is:

\[7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\]

And Allen's current age is:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109

Another friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. On average, how many did the friends guess?

To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend's guess is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend's guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
