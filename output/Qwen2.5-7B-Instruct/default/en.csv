mgsm-en-47,"First, we determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, the number of blue ties is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]
Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]
The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[
120 - 90 = 30

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs per week.

First, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week and his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, the total revenue per week is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week.",294,294

\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed from the book bag to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove 7.5 pounds more. Each toy weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

mgsm-en-53,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Friday is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is $0.

2. Determine the number of unripe oranges.
3. Determine the number of sour oranges.
4. Subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.

Let's start with the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Total number of oranges} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe:
\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

We are given that there is 1 bad orange:
\[ \text{Number of bad oranges} = 1 \]

We are also given that there are 2 sour oranges:
\[ \text{Number of sour oranges} = 2 \]

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (\text{Number of bad oranges} + \text{Number of unripe oranges} + \text{Number of sour oranges}) \]

   \text{Level 4} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Now, we sum the square footage of all four levels:
\[
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60
mgsm-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days: \( 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed: \( \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is \(\boxed{2}\).",2,5
mgsm-en-77,"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of laundry David does.
2. Use the relationship between David's and Sarah's laundry to find out how much Sarah does.
3. Use the relationship between Sarah's and Raymond's laundry to find out how much Raymond does.
4. Calculate the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

We start with the information that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does as follows:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does as follows:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\).",100,100
mgsm-en-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 versus packages of 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying the flowers at the better price, we subtract the lower cost from the higher cost:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Thus, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) by buying 18 flowers at the better price.",18,6

2. Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together.

First, let's find Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 498 \]

Now, we need to find their combined weights. We add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 125 + 498 \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 623 \]

3. Add the extra minutes he has used to other people.
4. Subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan to find out how many minutes he has left.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day over the 30 days of the month:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250
mgsm-en-244,"Let's start by determining how many fries Griffin had after Kyle took some. Initially, Griffin had 24 fries, and Kyle took 5 of them. So, Griffin had:
\[ 24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries} \]

Next, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries} \]
So, after Billy took his fries, Griffin had:
\[ 19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries} \]

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \( x \). After receiving \( x \) fries from Ginger, Griffin had:
\[ 9 + x \text{ fries} \]

Colby then took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries} \]
So, after Colby took his fries, Griffin had:
\[ 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries} \]

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 7 + x = 27 \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 27 - 7 = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries.",20,20
mgsm-en-245,"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is given by the number of snails in the aquarium with more snails minus the number of snails in the aquarium with fewer snails. This difference is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
To find \( f \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( \boxed{7} \).",7,7
mgsm-en-246,"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week.
2. Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works over the 5 weeks.
3. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
4. Apply the 10% discount to find the final amount Jean paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week.**

The makeup artist works 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week.
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works over the 5 weeks.**

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost before the discount.**

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Apply the 10% discount to find the final amount Jean paid.**

A 10% discount means Jean pays 90% of the total cost. So, the final amount Jean paid is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean paid is \(\boxed{27000}\).",27000,27000

4. Calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate over the two days.
5. Calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.
6. Determine the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday. According to the problem, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, Sue ate:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. The problem states that Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. Since her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, Sue ate:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue are:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories consumed by Sue's sister are:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the number of more calories Sue consumed than her sister is \(\boxed{5600}\).",5600,
polymath-low-en-0,"First, we calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we determine how many eggs Janet uses for her own consumption and baking. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast each day and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. Therefore, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[3 + 4 = 7\]

Now, we find out how many eggs are left to sell at the farmers' market by subtracting the eggs used from the total number of eggs:
\[16 - 7 = 9\]

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, the amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs each day is:
\[9 \times 2 = 18\]

Thus, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \(\boxed{18}\).",18,18

2. It also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the amounts of blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts needed:

polymath-low-en-2,"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The original purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value of the house is the original value plus 150% of the original value.

The increase in value due to repairs is:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair costs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

polymath-low-en-5,"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5. Let's break down the calculation step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can see that the pattern of costs for the glasses will alternate between $5 and $3. Therefore, the cost for the glasses can be grouped as follows:
- The cost of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ..., 15th glasses (the odd-numbered glasses) is $5 each.
- The cost of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ..., 16th glasses (the even-numbered glasses) is $3 each.

Since there are 16 glasses, there are 8 odd-numbered glasses and 8 even-numbered glasses. The total cost can be calculated as:

polymath-low-en-6,"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep Seattle has. According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep Charleston has is \( 4S \).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep Toulouse has is \( 2 \times 4S = 8S \).

Now, we substitute the value of \( S \) into the expressions for the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse:
- Charleston has \( 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.
- Toulouse has \( 8S = 8 \times 20 = 160 \) sheep.

Next, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = S + 4S + 8S = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

polymath-low-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around:
\[ \text{Distance to the turn-around point} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance John travels on his way back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not cover any distance during this time. Then he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance covered in 0.5 hours} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time he has for driving back home is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph):
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 4 \, \text{hours} - 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance covered in 1.5 hours} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances he has traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John initially traveled 180 miles away from home and then traveled a total of 315 miles back, the net distance from home is:
\[ \text{Net distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - (315 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles}) = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

1. **Initial Cost:**
   The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Growth and Revenue:**
   Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons. Each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue from selling lemons each year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]

3. **Annual Costs:**
   The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual costs:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}

First, we know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is \( \frac{x}{3} \). After selling these, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling to the red house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]
After selling these, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

The weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 35 \text{ hours/week} = 700 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \text{ dollars/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 35000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's denote the guesses as follows:
- The first friend's guess is 80.
- The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
  \[
  \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:
  \[
  \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100

4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout.

Let's start with step 1. The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Next, step 2. The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120

2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Find out how many tomatoes were in those cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are required to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:

First, we know that Amir eats 5 cookies. We can represent this as:
\[ \text{Cookies eaten by Amir} = 5 \]

Next, we are told that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Cody eats as follows:
\[ \text{Cookies eaten by Cody} = 3 \times \text{Cookies eaten by Amir} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, to find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we add the number of cookies each of them eats:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies eaten by Amir} + \text{Cookies eaten by Cody} = 5 + 15 = 20 \]

Thus, the total number of cookies that both Cody and Amir eat together is:

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   \[
   \text{Inner length} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Inner width} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Inner height} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The inner volume \( V \) of a box is given by the product of its inner length, width, and height.

   \[
   V = \text{Inner length} \times \text{Inner width} \times \text{Inner height}
   \]
   \[
   V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches.",72,72
mgsm-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and the hours spent on other days.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on the days we know:
- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes each night:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour/night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes:
  \[
  2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we sum the hours of TV watched on these days:
\[
2 \text{ hours (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the known hours from the total:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

mgsm-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:
- She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $10. The new price is:
  \[
  10 + 0.5 \times 10 = 15 \text{ dollars each}
  \]
- The total revenue from selling these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $16. The new price is:

- Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the lumber is:
  \[
  150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. Since the total number of parts is 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of teaspoons by 20:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}

mgsm-en-129,"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue from both the patients and the doctors, and then find the difference between these revenues.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors with the patients each day:
\[
500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes per patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes}
\]
Convert the total minutes into hours:
\[
12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the doctors:
\[
200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars per hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the revenue from the patients:
\[
500 \text{ patients} \times 200 \text{ dollars per hour} = 100000 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total revenue for the hospital is the sum of the revenue from the patients and the revenue from the doctors:
\[
30000 \text{ dollars} + 100000 \text{ dollars} = 130000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the only cost mentioned is the payment to the doctors, the hospital's profit is the total revenue minus the cost to the doctors:
\[
130000 \text{ dollars} - 30000 \text{ dollars} = 100000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is:
\[
\boxed{100000}

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[
25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams}
\]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. According to the problem, each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
\]
Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[
80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams}

1. Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Determine the total cost of the cups based on the given information.
3. Find the cost of each cup.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each half dozen plate costs $6000, the total cost for half a dozen plates is:
\[ 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 6000 - 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since twenty dozen cups cost $4800, we first convert twenty dozen to the number of individual cups:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

The cost of each cup is then:

Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn. Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
Let \( x \) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so her earnings from mowing the lawn are:
\[ 4x \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, her total savings before and after babysitting and mowing the lawn is:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least $70. So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times. The final answer is:

According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day each, and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day each. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can write the following equations:

\[ w = r + 2 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

First, substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Next, distribute the 5 in the second equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers counted on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. So, the number of customers on the first day is:
\[ \text{Day 1} = 100 \]

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ \text{Day 2} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of customers over the three days is 500. Let \( x \) be the number of customers counted on the third day. Then we can write the equation for the total number of customers as:
\[ \text{Day 1} + \text{Day 2} + \text{Day 3} = 500 \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:

Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

The problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Subtracting \( 2S \) from both sides, we get:
\[ 16 = 2S \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Now, we find Zack's current age. The problem states that Harriet is half the age of Zack:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

\[ \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \]
\[ \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:

Now, we add the time taken for both trips to find the total travel time:
\[ 6 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]",9,9
mgsm-en-226,"First, we need to determine the new number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes. Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

After buying 14 grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cards James has:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \]

Next, we find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type card. This probability is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is \(\boxed{33}\).",33,33

\]

Next, we calculate the combined rate at which they can place pieces together. Adding their rates gives:

\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[
\frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, we subtract 2 from 500:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Next, we find the number of girls in the class. Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We are told that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:

\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is \(\boxed{40}\).",40,40
polymath-low-en-96,"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by calculating the amount of sleep James got. Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. We can find the amount of sleep James got by multiplying 9 by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

So, James slept 6 hours. Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
9 - 6 = 3
\]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final answer is:

polymath-low-en-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{12}\).",12,12
polymath-low-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars from the line took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This can be written as:
\[ x + 20 - 5 \]

Since the original number of cars on the motorway was 30, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 15 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,5

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Determine how many potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has, and then add the new potted plants she received.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(\boxed{58}\).",58,58

polymath-low-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- He also has a glass of water before bed.
- Therefore, on a weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- He does not have a glass of water before bed on the weekend.
- Therefore, on a weekend day, John drinks \(3\) glasses of water.

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses}\]

Now, we sum the glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:

The problem states that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile. Since 10 minutes are needed to cover 3 miles, the time to cover 1 mile is:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles. We multiply the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42:
\[

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The inner volume \(V\) of a box is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72
polymath-low-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and break down the time spent on each day.

First, let's summarize the time spent on TV each day:
- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- **Friday**: 2 hours
- **Wednesday**: Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday.

The total time spent watching TV is given as 7 hours. We can set up the following equation to represent the total time:

\[
1 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} = 7

Simplify the equation:

\[
1 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
4.5 + 0.5x = 7

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50

polymath-low-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:
- She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}

- Therefore, the total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is 50% more than the original price of $10. The new price is:
  \[
  10 + 0.5 \times 10 = 15 \text{ dollars each}
  \]
  So, the total revenue from selling these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is 50% more than the original price of $16. The new price is:

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find the amount of sugar used by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for the sugar:

First, we know that on the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

polymath-low-en-119,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current salaries of Adrien and Lylah, given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 and it increased by 40% since then. We also know that Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago.

First, let's find Adrien's current salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and it increased by 40%. Therefore, his current salary is:
\[
40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
\]

Next, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's salary as:
\[
\text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{130} = \frac{400000 \div 10}{130 \div 10} = \frac{40000}{13} \approx 30769.23
\]

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is:
\[
30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92
\]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:
\[
56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, we will assume a month has approximately 4 weeks. Therefore, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is \(\boxed{240}\).",240,240
polymath-low-en-121,"First, we determine the number of fruits each person brought. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette brought is:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \]

Next, we calculate the number of fruits Kael brought. Kael brought twice the number of apples that Morisette brought, which is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples} \]
Kael also brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges} \]
Therefore, the total number of fruits Kael brought is:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \]

To find the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael, we add the total number of fruits each brought:
\[ 13 + 14 = 27 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]",27,27
polymath-low-en-122,"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sleep on Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Monday's sleep} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. Therefore, she slept:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   on both Tuesday and Wednesday.

3. **Sleep on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday:**
   For the rest of the week, Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, she slept:
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]
   on each of these days.

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   We sum up the hours she slept each day:
   \[
   \text{Total sleep} = \text{Monday's sleep} + \text{Tuesday's sleep} + \text{Wednesday's sleep} + \text{Thursday's sleep} + \text{Friday's sleep} + \text{Saturday's sleep}

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is \(\boxed{41}\).",41,48
polymath-low-en-123,"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining time.

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. Calculate the remaining time after the first 3 hours:
   - Total time = 7 hours
   - Time remaining = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours.

3. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the remaining 4 hours:
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles.

4. Calculate the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:
   - Total distance = Distance in the first 3 hours + Distance in the remaining 4 hours = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\) miles.",50,50

polymath-low-en-32,"To determine how many hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends on each dog per day.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs to find the total daily hours.
3. Multiply the total daily hours by the number of days in a week to find the total weekly hours.

Step 1: Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Step 2: John has 10 dogs. Therefore, the total number of hours spent per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

polymath-low-en-33,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We can express these conditions with the following equations:

1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

\[ G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,70
polymath-low-en-34,"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount to find Aaron's jewels:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this amount to find Siobhan's jewels:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23

polymath-low-en-37,"First, we calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. Therefore, the total money from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost for the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets. We can express this as:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165, we can confirm the calculation:
\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
This $30 is the money he would have had left if he had not bought the video games, but since he actually had $5 left, it confirms our earlier calculation.

Since John spent all his money on the video games and had $5 left, it means he did not have any lego sets left to sell. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

polymath-low-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

First, we know that John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much time on the other two days. Let's calculate the time he runs on the other two days:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time on the third day} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he runs each day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. The distance he runs on the first day is:
\[ \text{Distance on the first day} = v \times 3 \]
The distance he runs on the second day is:
\[ \text{Distance on the second day} = v \times 1.5 \]
The distance he runs on the third day is:
\[ \text{Distance on the third day} = v \times 1.5 \]

The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances from each day:
\[ v \times 3 + v \times 1.5 + v \times 1.5 = 60 \]
\[ 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 60 \]
\[ 6v = 60 \]
\[ v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

So, John runs at a speed of \( \boxed{10} \) miles per hour.",10,10
polymath-low-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to first find her walking and running speeds. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. In six hours, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance traveled while running is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance traveled while walking is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

1. Identify the distance the javelin can be thrown when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Determine the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still be able to throw the javelin within the dragon's 1000-foot reach.

First, we know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance the javelin can be thrown when Polly is holding the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's 1000-foot reach Polly can stand and still be able to throw the javelin. Since the javelin can be thrown 1200 feet when Polly is holding the gemstone, the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin. The final answer is:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7

2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

First, we calculate the total number of Post-it notes used and remaining before considering the package she purchased:
\[
\text{Total Post-it Notes Used and Remaining} = \text{Initial Post-it Notes} + \text{Remaining Post-it Notes} - \text{Post-it Notes Used at Work}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\text{Total Post-it Notes Used and Remaining} = 80 + 23 - 220
\]

Perform the arithmetic:
\[
80 + 23 = 103
\]
\[
103 - 220 = -117
\]

This negative result indicates that Candice used more Post-it notes than she initially had, which means she must have purchased additional Post-it notes. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The equation becomes:
\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]
\[
x - 140 = 23

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]
Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]
Finally, we find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

polymath-low-en-52,"First, let's determine the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight Uriah needs to remove from his book bag to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove 7.5 pounds more, and each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[

Thus, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys.",15,15
polymath-low-en-53,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Friday is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Since no truck tires are repaired on Friday, the revenue from truck tires is \(0\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Friday is \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- The revenue on Thursday is $520.
- The revenue on Friday is $480.
- The difference in revenue is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday.",40,40

polymath-low-en-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of 18 flowers under both pricing options and then find the difference between these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers if Vincent buys them in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Each package contains 3 flowers and costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packages}
  \]
- The total cost for 6 packages is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers if Vincent buys them in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Each package contains 2 flowers and costs $1.
- To find out how many packages are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packages}
  \]
- The total cost for 9 packages is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
\[
15 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price.",18,6
mgsm-en-141,"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

There are also twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Now, we substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation. First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\).",400,400

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour, we calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week.",140,140
mgsm-en-143,"To determine the total cost of everything John bought, we need to break down the expenses and apply the tax where necessary.

First, let's identify the food and non-food items:
- Food items: milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups
- Non-food items: roach traps

The costs of the items are:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
\[
2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
\[
4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax on the roach traps:
\[
0.10 \times 4 = 0.4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the tax to the cost of the non-food items:
\[
4 + 0.4 = 4.4 \text{ dollars}

\[3 + 5 = 8\]

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths needed. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach is:
\[8 \times 2 = 16\]
and the total number of packs of cloths is:
\[8 \times 1 = 8\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so the total cost for the bleach is:
\[16 \times 2 = 32\]
and the total cost for the cloths is:
\[8 \times 5 = 40\]
Therefore, the total expenses are:
\[32 + 40 = 72\]

Kim's total income each week is $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so the profit is:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many times John can harvest in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year by multiplying the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:

mgsm-en-150,"To determine how long the winner will be waiting for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to bike or skate to their respective homes. Time is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For Steve:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Steve takes less time to get home, he is the winner. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The number of fries left is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining fries. The number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).
5. Ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, the number of fries left before the ants carried off one is \( 5 + 1 = 6 \). Therefore, we have \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6

Next, we calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
\[
120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}

Then, we calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
\[
60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}

- She will be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work.

\[
\text{Lost income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we know the cost of hiring the accountant:
\[
\text{Cost of accountant} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Lost income} - \text{Cost of accountant} = 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more if she hires the accountant.",15,15
mgsm-en-165,"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this amount from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items Elvira is purchasing:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
\[ \text{Total cost of accessories} = 157 + 74 + 102 = 333 \]

Now, we add the cost of the computer to the total cost of the accessories:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1090 + 333 = 1423 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[ \text{Money left} = 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is \(\boxed{77}\).",77,77

mgsm-en-167,"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( B + S = 24 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old.",16,16

Next, let's calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team:
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so they run in:
  \[
  60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds}

- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they run in:
  \[

mgsm-en-184,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability of two different events and then compare them.

First, let's find the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's find the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number greater than 3})}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]
This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%

Therefore, the final answer is:

mgsm-en-186,"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables and the information given:
- Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
- There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. However, the problem does not specify the number of hamsters per cage, so we can ignore the hamsters for now since the total straw used is given as 160 pieces.
- There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. However, the problem does not specify the number of rabbits, so we can ignore the rabbits for now since the total straw used is given as 160 pieces.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.

From the information given, we can set up the equation for the total straw used:
\[ 18r + 20 + \text{(straw for hamsters)} = 160 \]
Since the problem states that the total straw distributed is 160 pieces and the straw for the rabbits is 20 pieces, the straw used for the hamsters must be:
\[ 160 - 20 = 140 \]
So, the equation simplifies to:
\[ 18r + 140 = 160 \]
Subtract 140 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 18r = 20 \]
Divide both sides by 18:

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement to ensure all conditions are met correctly. However, the problem specifically states the total straw used is 160, and the only variable affecting the straw used for rats is \( r \).

1. **Initial Amount**: Mandy owes $100.
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02.

We will calculate the amount owed at the end of each month.

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
- Amount owed after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
- Amount owed after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Amount owed after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Therefore, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is \(\boxed{106.12}\).",12,106
mgsm-en-0,"First, we determine the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses for her own consumption and for baking. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. Therefore, the total number of eggs used per day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

We then subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid to find the number of eggs remaining for sale:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \(\boxed{18}\).",18,18

2. It also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total amount of fiber needed:
\[

1. Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

First, let's find the total cost of the house and repairs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of repairs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
\]

Next, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. The value of the house increased by 150%, so the new value is the original cost of the house plus 150% of the original cost:
\[
\text{New value} = \text{Cost of the house} + 150\% \times \text{Cost of the house} = 80,000 + 1.5 \times 80,000 = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
\]

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
\]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

mgsm-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the total distance to his home.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled to the point where he turned around:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the distance John traveled back towards home. He spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he did not cover any distance during this time. Then, he drove for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drove for the remaining time of 4 hours minus the 2 hours in standstill traffic and the 0.5 hours at 30 mph, which is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
At a speed of 80 mph, the distance he covered in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance John has traveled back towards home is:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the distance to his home is 180 miles and he has traveled 135 miles back, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

Thus, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is \(\boxed{45}\) miles.",45,45
mgsm-en-9,"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked. Here are the steps:

1. **Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:**
   Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. Therefore, her regular pay for 40 hours is:
   \[
   40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400
   \]

2. **Calculate the overtime pay for the additional hours:**
   Eliza worked 45 hours in total, which means she worked 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Therefore, her overtime pay rate is:
   \[
   1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour}
   \]
   So, her overtime pay for 5 hours is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, after selling to the red house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. After selling at the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is also equal to \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
To clear the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]
Next, we add 2 to both sides:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]
Then, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[
2x = 36

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = 18

mgsm-en-33,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We can express these conditions with the following equations:

1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

\[ G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,70

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using some at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

First, we calculate the total number of Post-it notes used and remaining:
\[ \text{Total Post-it Notes Used} = \text{Post-it Notes at Work} + \text{Remaining Post-it Notes} \]
\[ \text{Total Post-it Notes Used} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Next, we need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package. We know the total number of Post-it notes she had initially plus the package equals the total number of Post-it notes used:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163
