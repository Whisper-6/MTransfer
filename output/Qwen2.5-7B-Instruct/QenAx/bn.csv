mgsm-bn-75,"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we need to first determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level as \(A_1\), the second level as \(A_2\), the third level as \(A_3\), and the fourth level as \(A_4\). According to the problem, we have:
\[A_1 = 16\]
\[A_2 = 2 \times A_1 = 2 \times 16 = 32\]
\[A_3 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 32 = 64\]
\[A_4 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 64 = 128\]

Now, we need to find the average square footage of a level. The average is the total square footage of all levels divided by the number of levels. The total square footage is:
\[A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240\]

The number of levels is 4, so the average square footage is:
\[\text{Average} = \frac{240}{4} = 60\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on Grace's weight.
3. Add Grace's and Alex's weights together to get their combined weight.

First, we know that Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Next, we calculate Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we can express Alex's weight as:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
Substituting Grace's weight into the equation, we get:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together to find their combined weight:

mgsm-bn-84,"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

The problem also states that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can substitute this value back into the second equation to find \( W \):

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The initial purchase price of the house is $80,000 and the repairs cost $50,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. Therefore, the new value of the house is the original value plus 150% of the original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increases by $80,000 \times 1.5 = $120,000. So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much profit Josh made. The total cost for Josh is the initial purchase price plus the cost of repairs, which is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The Windows update restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

mgsm-bn-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from his home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels before he turns around:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the distance John travels after he turns around. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
So, the distance he covers in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding up all the distances John has traveled after he turns around:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45

mgsm-bn-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the cumulative profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost**: The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3. Therefore, the net profit each year is:
   \[
   \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]
4. **Cumulative Profit**: We need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the cumulative profit is positive. The cumulative profit after \( n \) years is the net profit per year times \( n \) minus the initial cost:
   \[
   7.5n - 90

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. After selling at the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
5. After selling at the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). According to the problem, this number is 5. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 99 = 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104
mgsm-bn-30,"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let's say Darrell's age is \(7x\) and Allen's age is \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age. Allen's age is \(11x\):
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

The problem asks for Allen's age 10 years from now. So, we add 10 to Allen's current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
mgsm-bn-31,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses made by each friend.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

Let's denote the first friend's guess as \(80\).

The second friend's guess is \(20\) more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

The third friend's guess is \(25\%\) more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
\]

Now, we have the guesses: \(80\), \(60\), and \(100\). To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed:**
   Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**

   \]

4. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in six hours.
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}

1. Determine the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Calculate the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

2. Calculate how many calories are left for the day.
3. Determine how many servings are left.
4. Calculate how many grams of chips can be eaten with the remaining calories.

First, we know that the bag of chips has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories. So, the total calories in the bag are:
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and 1800 calories have already been consumed. So, the remaining calories are:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings can be eaten with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, the number of servings that can be eaten is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since the bag has 5 servings in total and we can only eat 0.8 servings, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 0.8 servings. The bag has 300 grams for 5 servings, so each serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams/serving} \]

Therefore, 0.8 servings would be:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the number of grams that can be eaten is:

Next, we need to find the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \]

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:

4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

Let's start with step 1. The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80

3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked into sauce. Therefore, the volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. Since the sauce made is 32 ounces, the volume of tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are required to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Therefore, the inner dimensions of one box are:
     \[
     (5 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (6 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (4 - 2) \text{ inches} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the product of its length, width, and height.
   - So, the inner volume of one box is:
     \[

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

mgsm-bn-111,"To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water that entered the boat.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the speed at which she rows is:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
\]
The total distance to the shore is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]
Next, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[
\text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
\]
To find the total amount of water that entered the boat, we multiply the rate of water intake by the total distance rowed:
\[
\text{Total water intake} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - She has 10 such boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - She has 5 such boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost of all boards: \( 100 + 80 = 180 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.

1. **Revenue from 2x4x10 boards:**
   - The price has increased by 50%, so the new price is \( 10 + 0.5 \times 10 = 15 \) dollars per board.
   - She has 10 such boards.
   - Total revenue for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) dollars.

2. **Revenue from 4x4x10 boards:**
   - The price has increased by 50%, so the new price is \( 16 + 0.5 \times 16 = 24 \) dollars per board.
   - She has 5 such boards.
   - Total revenue for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \times 24 = 120 \) dollars.

3. **Total revenue:**

First, let's denote the amount of sugar used as \(7x\) and the amount of water used as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find the amount of sugar used by multiplying \(7x\) by \(x\):

   - Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \).
   - According to the problem, \( 40000 = L + 0.3L \).
   - This simplifies to \( 40000 = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \).

   - Adrien's salary four years later is 40 percent more than what he was making four years ago.
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.
   - So, Adrien's salary four years later is \( 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years later is 40 percent more than what she was making four years ago.
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was \( \frac{400000}{13} \).
   - So, Lylah's salary four years later is \( \frac{400000}{13} + 0.4 \times \frac{400000}{13} = \frac{400000}{13} \times 1.4 = \frac{560000}{13} \approx 43076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later is $56000.
   - Lylah's salary four years later is \( \frac{560000}{13} \).
   - The total salary is \( 56000 + \frac{560000}{13} = \frac{56000 \times 13 + 560000}{13} = \frac{728000 + 560000}{13} = \frac{1288000}{13} = 99076.92 \).

mgsm-bn-129,"To determine the hospital's profit from the daily patient visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by all patients in the hospital each day.
2. Determine the total revenue generated from patients.
3. Determine the total cost incurred by the hospital.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent by all patients in the hospital each day.**

The hospital sees 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. First, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue generated from patients.**

The hospital charges $200 per hour for each patient. Therefore, the total revenue from patients is:
\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total cost incurred by the hospital.**

The hospital pays $150 per hour to the doctors. Therefore, the total cost to the hospital is:
\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

The profit is:

mgsm-bn-154,"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his class schedule and then calculate the total hours for the entire semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:

1. **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
   - Kimo has 3 classes each day.
   - Each class is 1 hour long.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
   - Since he has classes on 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours for these three days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

2. **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
   - Kimo has 2 classes each day.
   - Each class is 2 hours long.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
   - Since he has classes on 2 days (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours for these two days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends on classes in one week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TTh)} = 17 \text{ hours per week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours for the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours per week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\).",272,272
mgsm-bn-155,"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

First, let's calculate the length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods:
- The total length in inches is \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
- The total length in feet is \(\frac{3360}{12} = 280\) feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet.",280,280

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. Each back and forth trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[
15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each trip to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[
200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We do this by subtracting the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[

   They made a profit of $25. Let \( R \) be the total revenue. The profit is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   Given the profit is $25, we can write:
   \[
   25 = R - \text{Total Cost}

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   The total cost consists of the cost of lemons and sugar. Let \( G \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they made. The cost for lemons per gallon is $3, and the cost for sugar per gallon is $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 3G + 2G = 5G

3. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of glasses sold:**
   They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. Therefore, the total revenue \( R \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   R = 0.50 \times \text{Total Number of Glasses Sold}
   \]
   The total number of glasses sold is \( 20G \). Thus:
   \[
   R = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Jan's current age is 30.

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Jan is 30, we can use the information about Mark's age two years ago.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Let Mark's current age be \(M\). Then, two years ago, Mark's age was \(M - 2\).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \(M - 2 = 14 + 5\).
   - Simplifying the right side, we get \(M - 2 = 19\).
   - Solving for \(M\), we get \(M = 19 + 2 = 21\).
   - So, Mark's current age is 21.

mgsm-bn-184,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Next, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[
50\% - 25\% = 25\%

2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with monthly compounding interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Plugging in the values:

First, let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as \( x \) and the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B as \( y \). According to the problem, Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers, so we have:
\[ x = y \]
Since the total number of sentences edited each week is 1000, we can write:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.

mgsm-bn-207,"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the weight of each candied apple.
2. Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars.
3. Calculate the total weight of the candied apples.
4. Sum the weights from steps 2 and 3 to get the total weight of the bag.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40 grams:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, each weighing 20 grams:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag:
\[ \text{Total weight of the bag} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

mgsm-bn-209,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**

2. Determine how much money Sara will earn from babysitting.
3. Determine how much more money Sara needs after babysitting.
4. Calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants to buy 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara will earn from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times, and she earns $5 each time, so the total earnings from babysitting are $5 * 4 = $20.

Now, let's determine how much more money Sara needs after babysitting:
- Sara already had $10 saved.
- After babysitting, she will have $10 + $20 = $30.
- The amount of money she still needs is $70 - $30 = $40.

Finally, let's calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40:
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
- Therefore, the number of times she needs to mow the lawn is $40 / $4 = 10.

mgsm-bn-211,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, which can be written as:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \), we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( r = 4 \).

To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected each day would be:
\[ 3 \times 4 + 5 \times 6 = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park.
2. Determine the time Gary spends walking based on his walking speed.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Here, the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the information about the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let the number of customers counted on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is 8 gallons. Therefore, the answer is:

Let's start with the first step. James originally has 40 water type cards. After losing 8 of them, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

Next, we calculate the new total number of cards. James originally has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards, which totals to:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]
After buying 14 more grass type cards, the new total number of cards is:
\[ 90 + 14 = 104 \]

Now, we determine the probability of picking a water type card. The probability is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{104} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{32}{104} \times 100 = \frac{3200}{104} \approx 30.7692 \]

Rounding 30.7692 to the nearest integer, we get 31. Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]",31,33
mgsm-bn-227,"To determine how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his burrito and then subtract the value of his gift card.

1. **Base burrito cost**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 \times 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade (chips and a drink)**: $3.00

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00
\]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract this from the total cost:

Finally, we will convert the time from minutes to hours.

1. **Calculate Kalinda's rate:**
   Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Calculate her mom's rate:**
   Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. Therefore, her mom's rate is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**
   Each car sells for $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20000 = 240000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the cars is:

mgsm-bn-236,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pens Ram can have in total if he uses the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens. At this point, he has 25 pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling:**
   After using these 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens. He can use the ink from 5 of these empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, after the first cycle, he will have:
   \[
   25 - 5 + 1 = 21 \text{ pens}
   \]
   Here, he uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he loses 5 pens but gains 1 new pen, resulting in a net loss of 4 pens. Therefore, he has 21 pens left.

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling:**
   Now he has 21 empty pens. He can use the ink from 5 of these empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, after the second cycle, he will have:
   \[
   21 - 5 + 1 = 17 \text{ pens}
   \]
   Again, he uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he loses 5 pens but gains 1 new pen, resulting in a net loss of 4 pens. Therefore, he has 17 pens left.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling:**
   Now he has 17 empty pens. He can use the ink from 5 of these empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, after the third cycle, he will have:
   \[
   17 - 5 + 1 = 13 \text{ pens}
   \]
   Again, he uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he loses 5 pens but gains 1 new pen, resulting in a net loss of 4 pens. Therefore, he has 13 pens left.

5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling:**
   Now he has 13 empty pens. He can use the ink from 5 of these empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, after the fourth cycle, he will have:
   \[
   13 - 5 + 1 = 9 \text{ pens}
   \]
   Again, he uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he loses 5 pens but gains 1 new pen, resulting in a net loss of 4 pens. Therefore, he has 9 pens left.

6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling:**
   Now he has 9 empty pens. He can use the ink from 5 of these empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, after the fifth cycle, he will have:
   \[
   9 - 5 + 1 = 5 \text{ pens}
   \]
   Again, he uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he loses 5 pens but gains 1 new pen, resulting in a net loss of 4 pens. Therefore, he has 5 pens left.

7. **Sixth Cycle of Refilling:**
   Now he has 5 empty pens. He can use the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, after the sixth cycle, he will have:
   \[
   5 - 5 + 1 = 1 \text{ pen}

   At this point, he does not have enough empty pens to make another new pen.

Adding up all the pens he has at each step, the total number of pens he ends up with is:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast.
3. Subtract the number of eggs used for baking muffins.
4. Determine the number of eggs remaining, which she sells at the farmers' market.
5. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs at $2 per egg.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, the number of eggs left after breakfast is:
   \[
   16 - 3 = 13
   \]
3. Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins every day. So, the number of eggs left after baking is:
   \[
   13 - 4 = 9
   \]
4. Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market at $2 per egg. So, the revenue from selling the eggs is:

polymath-low-bn-2,"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (initial purchase price plus repairs) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The initial purchase price of the house is $80,000, and Josh spends $50,000 on repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. The increase in value is 150% of the original purchase price of $80,000.

The increase in value is:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[
\boxed{70000}

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens:
   Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
   \[
   3 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups/day}
   \]

2. Determine the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

polymath-low-bn-5,"To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost of the glasses in pairs:
- The cost of the first glass in a pair is $5.
- The cost of the second glass in a pair is $3.
- Therefore, the cost of one pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of one pair:

polymath-low-bn-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then determine his net distance from home.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

2. **Return Trip:**
   John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not cover any distance during this time.
   \[
   \text{Distance covered in standstill traffic} = 0 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   After the standstill traffic, he drives for the next 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, he has covered an additional 15 miles. Now, he has 1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   So, he covers an additional 120 miles. The total distance he has covered on his return trip is:
   \[
   15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
   \]
   Since he started 180 miles away from home, the net distance from home at the end of 4 hours is:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Growth and Revenue:**
   Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]

3. **Annual Expenses:**
   The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point:**
   To find the number of years it takes to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the total net profit to equal the initial cost of $90. Let \( n \) be the number of years. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:

1. **After selling at the green house:**
   - Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. **After selling to the red house:**
   - Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. **After selling at the orange house:**
   - Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
   - According to the problem, after the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
     \]

4. **Solving the equation:**
   - First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
     \[

   তাই, $3 \times 1 = 3$ টি DVD বিক্রি হয়েছে।

2. পরবর্তী 2 গালিগালার ক্ষেত্রে, প্রতিটি গালিগালা 2টি DVD কিনেছে।
   তাই, $2 \times 2 = 4$ টি DVD বিক্রি হয়েছে।

3. শেষ 3 গালিগালার ক্ষেত্রে, কোনো DVD কিনেনি।
   তাই, $3 \times 0 = 0$ টি DVD বিক্রি হয়েছে।

এখন, সবগুলি বিক্রি গণনা করলে আমরা পাই:
$3 + 4 + 0 = 7$ টি DVD বিক্রি হয়েছে।

তাই, চূড়ান্ত সংখ্যাটি $\boxed{7}$।",7,7
polymath-low-bn-23,"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.

First, let's find the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The time difference between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. So, if the candle burns for 4 hours, the total amount it will melt is:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.",0,8
polymath-low-bn-24,"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price, because he received a 25% discount. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

The relationship between the original price and the discounted price can be expressed as:
\[ 19.50 = P \times (1 - 0.25) = P \times 0.75 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = \frac{19.50 \times 100}{0.75 \times 100} = \frac{1950}{75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book is \( \boxed{26} \).",26,26
polymath-low-bn-25,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered other than the pizza. Then, we can use the total amount she paid to find out the cost of the pizza and subsequently the number of boxes of pizza.

1. Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:
   \[
   \text{Cost of chicken meal} = 12
   \]

2. Calculate the cost of the 5 packs of milk:
   \[
   \text{Cost of milk} = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of the 4 apples:
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6
   \]

4. Let the number of boxes of pizza be \( x \). The cost of the pizza is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pizza} = 8.50x
   \]

5. The total cost of all the items is the sum of the costs of the chicken meal, milk, apples, and pizza. According to the problem, this total cost is $50:
   \[
   12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50
   \]

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   33 + 8.50x = 50
   \]

7. Isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 33 from both sides:
   \[
   8.50x = 50 - 33
   \]
   \[
   8.50x = 17
   \]

8. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 8.50:
   \[
   x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2
   \]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza.",2,2
polymath-low-bn-26,"To determine how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shorts:
\[
\text{Cost of one pair of shorts} = \$16.50
\]
\[
\text{Number of pairs of shorts} = 3
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pants:
\[
\text{Cost of one pair of pants} = \$22.50
\]
\[
\text{Number of pairs of pants} = 3
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of pants} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes:
\[
\text{Cost of one pair of shoes} = \$42
\]
\[
\text{Number of pairs of shoes} = 3
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of shoes} = 3 \times 42 = 126
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126
\]

Let's add these amounts step by step:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 126 = 243
\]

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:
\[
\boxed{243}

polymath-low-bn-27,"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

First, since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy. Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons required is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16
polymath-low-bn-28,"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He first stopped after 20 miles. This means he has $60 - 20 = 40$ miles left to travel after his first stop.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, 15 miles before the end would be at $60 - 15 = 45$ miles from the start.

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop. 

So, the distance between his first and second stops is $45 - 20 = 25$ miles.

$\boxed{25}$",25,25
polymath-low-bn-29,"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33 and the cost of the other pair is twice as much, which is $66. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is therefore \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. The problem also states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \).",104,104
polymath-low-bn-30,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen, and then find Allen's age 10 years from now.

1. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.
2. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
3. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
4. Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 18:
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
5. Now, substitute \(x = 9\) back into the expressions for Darrell's and Allen's ages:
   \[
   \text{Darrell's age} = 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63
   \]
   \[
   \text{Allen's age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{109}

polymath-low-bn-31,"Let's denote the first friend's guess as \(80\). We'll calculate the guesses of the other two friends based on this.

1. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

2. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the guesses of the three friends: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average of these guesses, we sum them up and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
