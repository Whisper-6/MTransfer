mgsm-en-47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of each red tie:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   \[
   \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on ties:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
   \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = \frac{3 \times 120}{4} = \frac{360}{4} = 90
\]

Now, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units:
\[
120 - 90 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week and the chickens produce 252 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, the total revenue per week is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is:
  \[
  6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360
  \]
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is:
  \[
  4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160

Next, let's calculate the revenue on Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Friday is:
  \[
  12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480
  \]
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0
  \]
- The total revenue on Friday is:

2. Determine the number of unripe oranges.
3. Determine the number of sour oranges.
4. Subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.

Let's start with the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Total number of oranges} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe:
\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

We are given that there is 1 bad orange:
\[ \text{Number of bad oranges} = 1 \]

We are also given that there are 2 sour oranges:
\[ \text{Number of sour oranges} = 2 \]

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (\text{Number of bad oranges} + \text{Number of unripe oranges} + \text{Number of sour oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17 \]

- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:

- Revenue from marigolds: \(12 \text{ pots} \times \$3/\text{pot} = \$36\).
- Revenue from petunias: \(9 \text{ pots} \times \$2/\text{pot} = \$18\).
- Revenue from begonias: \(17 \text{ pots} \times \$2/\text{pot} = \$34\).

Finally, we sum the revenues from all the flowers to find the total amount Artie will make:

mgsm-en-75,"To determine the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to find the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16.

Let's denote the square footage of the levels from top to bottom as \( L_1, L_2, L_3, \) and \( L_4 \). We have:
\[ L_1 = 16 \]
\[ L_2 = \frac{L_1}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ L_3 = \frac{L_2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ L_4 = \frac{L_3}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can find the total square footage of all four levels by summing these values:
\[ L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + L_4 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\).",5,60
mgsm-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags are needed for that amount.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required for these 180 cups. Since each bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

The final answer is:

mgsm-en-77,"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we start by defining the amount of laundry each person does in terms of David's laundry.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does is:
\[
4D
\]

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
4D = 400
\]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
\]

Next, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, the amount of laundry Raymond does is:
\[
\frac{400}{2} = 200
\]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[
200 - 100 = 100
\]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\).",100,100
mgsm-en-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus buying them in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying the flowers at the better price, we subtract the cost of the cheaper option from the cost of the more expensive option:
\[

mgsm-en-82,"First, we need to determine Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, we subtract 2 from 500:

\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds. Now, we need to find their combined weights. We add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498 \]

Adding these values gives:

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us the equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

2. Calculate her salary after each of the next three years, given the 10% annual increase.

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's salary after 5 years of service.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary. The increase after 5 years is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
So, her salary after 5 years is:
\[ 600 + 60 = 660 \text{ per month} \]
Since there are 12 months in a year, her annual salary after 5 years is:
\[ 660 \times 12 = 7920 \]

**Step 2: Calculate her salary after each of the next three years.**

For each of the next three years, her salary will increase by 10% of the previous year's salary. Let's calculate her salary for each of the next three years.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value of the house increased by 150% after the repairs. This means the new value is the original purchase price plus 150% of the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% of $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost Josh incurred. This includes the initial purchase price plus the cost of repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:

mgsm-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then find the difference between this distance and the distance he needs to travel to get home.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled before he turned around:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance John traveled after turning around. He spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he did not travel any distance during this time. Then, he drove for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drove for the remaining time at 80 mph. The remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
So, the distance he traveled during this time is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding up all the distances John traveled:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John initially traveled 180 miles away from home, and he has only traveled 15 miles back towards home, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 15 \, \text{miles} = 165 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is \(\boxed{165}\) miles.",165,45
mgsm-en-9,"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. **Calculate the regular pay:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   \[
   \text{Regular pay} = 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the overtime pay:**
   - Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   \[
   \text{Overtime pay rate} = 1.2 \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}

First, let's define the variables and costs:
- Initial cost to plant the tree: \( \$90 \)
- Annual growth of lemons: \( 7 \) lemons per year
- Selling price per lemon: \( \$1.5 \)
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: \( \$3 \)

Next, we calculate the net profit per year:

First, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house sale is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house sale is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \]

We know that after the orange house sale, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To clear the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

- The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
  \[
  \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
  \]
- The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:
  \[
  \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
  \]

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
mgsm-en-32,"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends on the dogs each day.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week to get the weekly hours.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total number of hours he spends on the dogs each day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends on the dogs each week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\).",35,35
mgsm-en-33,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We can express these conditions with the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = \frac{80}{2} \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\).",70,70
mgsm-en-34,"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels, so half of Raymond's jewels is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Therefore, Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. This is straightforward.

Next, we need to calculate the points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, 25% more than 4 points is:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 5 points.

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Thus, the total points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\).",9,9
mgsm-en-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

First, we calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is \(\boxed{75}\).",75,75
mgsm-en-37,"First, we calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. Therefore, the total money from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the amount of money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can verify this by adding the cost of the video games and the remaining money:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total money from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165, we can confirm the calculation is correct. The problem asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all his lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ 0 \]

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available: 6 hours
   - Time spent running (one-third of the total time):
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking (two-thirds of the total time):
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}

mgsm-en-41,"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the distance the javelin can be thrown without the gemstone:**
   Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet without the gemstone.

2. **Determine the distance the javelin can be thrown with the gemstone:**
   When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone. Therefore, the distance with the gemstone is:
   \[
   3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon:**
   The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To ensure the javelin hits the dragon, Polly must stand within the range of the javelin's throw. Since the javelin can be thrown 1200 feet with the gemstone, Polly can stand up to 1200 feet away from the dragon.

4. **Determine how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand:**
   The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. Therefore, the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach is:

mgsm-en-45,"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time spent per article.

First, we know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. Let's denote the number of articles she wrote on Monday as \( A_{\text{Monday}} = 5 \).

Next, we need to find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday. According to the problem, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[
A_{\text{Tuesday}} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7

4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

Let's start with step 1. The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Next, for step 2, we calculate the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

For step 3, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:

mgsm-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have driven through, and 5 cars have taken an exit. Therefore, the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the first 15 minutes is \( 30 - x - 5 = 25 - x \).

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since the problem does not provide the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam, we can only express the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes in terms of the remaining cars. However, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

The number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is \( x \), and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is 20. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since the problem does not provide additional constraints or a total number of cars that drove through, we can solve for \( x \) using the information that the number of cars remaining after the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes should equal the total number of cars that originally drove through the traffic jam.

Given that the total number of cars that originally drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 20 = \text{total number of cars that drove through} \]

Since the problem does not provide the total number of cars that drove through, we can only solve for \( x \) using the information that the number of cars remaining after the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes should equal the total number of cars that originally drove through the traffic jam.

From the problem, we know that the number of cars remaining after the first 15 minutes is \( 25 - x \), and the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes is 20. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is:

\[ x + 20 \]

Since the total number of cars that originally drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 20 = \text{total number of cars that drove through} \]

Given that the total number of cars that originally drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

\[ x = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

\]

Thus, Solo needs to read \(\boxed{6}\) pages on average each day.",6,6
mgsm-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- He has a glass of water with breakfast.
- He has a glass of water with lunch.
- He has a glass of water with dinner.
- He has a glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks \(4\) glasses of water.

Since there are \(5\) weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is:
\[
4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- He has a glass of water with breakfast.
- He has a glass of water with lunch.
- He has a glass of water with dinner (but he has a soda instead of water).
- He has a glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks \(3\) glasses of water.

Since there are \(2\) weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is:
\[
3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses}
\]

Finally, we sum the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:
\[
20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses}
\]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
mgsm-en-103,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank spreads. The problem states that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.

First, we need to find the rate of spread in miles per minute. This can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total time required to cover the entire 42 miles of the city. We do this by dividing the total distance by the rate of spread:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}}
\]

To perform the division:
\[
\frac{42}{0.3} = \frac{42 \times 10}{0.3 \times 10} = \frac{420}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the fog bank \(\boxed{140}\) minutes to cover the whole city.",140,140

4. Determine the number of pieces left to be placed after Poppy's mom places her pieces.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

2. Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy's mom} = \frac{750}{3} = 250

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}

mgsm-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for all the time he spent watching TV throughout the week and then isolate the time spent on Wednesday.

First, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV on the other days:
- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes each night:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes:
  \[
  2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we sum the time spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[
2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes make up 1.5 hours:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}
\]

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.",30,3

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

First, we calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons of gas at $0.20 per gallon:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas:

\[ 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

The original cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards was $16 each, and she has five of them. Therefore, the total original cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The total original cost for all the lumber is:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
And the new price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is:
\[ 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The total selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]
And the total selling price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total selling price for all the lumber is:
\[ 150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit Sasha makes is the total selling price minus the original total cost:

mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water combined. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts in the mixture is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since the ratio tells us that the total parts are 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, we can find the total amount of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:

Additionally, the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2q = 4q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. This can be expressed as:
\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:

mgsm-en-152,"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies Carl buys. Since he buys ten packs and each pack contains six cookies, we calculate the total number of cookies as follows:
\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these 60 cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is:
\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars per cookie} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

1. **Final number of fries:**
   - The ants left 5 fries behind.

2. **Before the raccoon stole fries:**
   - The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fries before the raccoon stole.
   - The raccoon stole \(\frac{2}{3}x\), leaving \(\frac{1}{3}x\).
   - We know \(\frac{1}{3}x = 5\).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 5 \times 3 = 15
     \]

3. **Before the pigeons ate fries:**
   - Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
   - Total fries eaten by pigeons: \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
   - Let \( y \) be the number of fries before the pigeons ate.
   - We know \( y - 9 = 15 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 15 + 9 = 24
     \]

4. **Before the seagull ate fries:**
   - The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate.
   - Dave ate 14 fries.
   - The seagull ate \(\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7\) fries.
   - Let \( z \) be the number of fries before the seagull ate.
   - We know \( z - 7 = 24 \).

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,48
mgsm-en-154,"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - Each day, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}\)
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours}\)

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - Each day, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}\)
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours}\)

Next, we add the hours from all five days to find the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TTh)} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester:

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\).",272,272
mgsm-en-155,"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

First, let's calculate the length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a football field that is 100 yards long. The distance for one back and forth trip is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
So, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field and then runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for one back and forth trip on the 100-yard field is:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
The distance for one trip to the 40-yard line and back is:

   On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, we add 7 feet to the Monday depth:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, the depth on Tuesday is 24 feet.

3. **Depth on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
   \[

So, Locsin caught:
- \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish,
- \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses,
- \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:
\[10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \text{ fish}.\]

Then, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Locsin:

mgsm-en-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the increase rate:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars
   - Increase rate every two months: \( 20\% \) of the original price

2. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   - The price after the first two months:
     \[
     P_1 = P_0 + 0.20 \times P_0 = 20 + 0.20 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The price after the next two months (four months total):
     \[
     P_2 = P_1 + 0.20 \times P_1 = 24 + 0.20 \times 24 = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The price after the next two months (six months total):
     \[
     P_3 = P_2 + 0.20 \times P_2 = 28.8 + 0.20 \times 28.8 = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Generalize the price increase formula:**
   - The price after \( n \) two-month periods can be expressed as:
     \[
     P_n = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20)^n
     \]
   - Here, \( n \) is the number of two-month periods. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods:
     \[
     n = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]

4. **Calculate the price after 36 months:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Compute \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 25.545

6. **Calculate the final price:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 25.545 \approx 510.90

3. The cost of an action figure is $5.

First, let's find the cost of the doll. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and each action figure costs $5, the cost of the doll is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know the cost of one red car is $4. The number of red cars is 5, so the total cost of the red cars is:

   - Let \( G \) be the number of glasses sold.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.
   - The total revenue is \( 0.50G \).

3. **Relate the number of glasses to the number of gallons:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, \( G = 20 \times \text{number of gallons} \).

4. **Express the total cost in terms of the number of gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of gallons made.
   - The total cost is \( 5N \).

5. **Substitute the expressions for total revenue and total cost into the profit equation:**
   - \( 25 = 0.50 \times 20N - 5N \).

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   - \( 25 = 10N - 5N \).
   - \( 25 = 5N \).

7. **Solve for \( N \):**
   - \( N = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \).

8. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times N = 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15

The amount spent on rent is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

The amount spent on car fuel is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total amount spent on rent and car fuel is:
\[
1500 + 2000 = 3500 \text{ dollars}
\]

The remaining amount after these expenses is:
\[
6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.
2. Use Bo's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Monic has.
3. Use Monic's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Bo's crabs} = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many crabs Monic has. According to the problem, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. The problem states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Finally, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\).",122,122

First, let's calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.
\[
\text{Earnings for the first week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Identify Jan's age:**
   Jan is 30 years old.

2. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   Let \( M \) be Mark's current age. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).

3. **Set up the relationship between Mark's age and Jan's age two years ago:**
   According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Jan's age two years ago was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \( 14 + 5 = 19 \).

4. **Find Mark's current age:**
   Since two years ago Mark was 19, his current age \( M \) is:
   \[
   M = 19 + 2 = 21

mgsm-en-183,"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team. Each of the four runners runs the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the faster team is:
\[
55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team. The first runner runs the 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for the four runners are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for the slower team is the sum of these times:
\[
60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two teams:

mgsm-en-184,"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

First, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
2. There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
3. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).

Next, we know the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
4. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Let's assume there is one hamster per cage, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

Additionally, we know the number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
5. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed is the sum of the pieces given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can solve for \( r \):
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with a monthly interest rate \( r \) is given by:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Here, \( P = 100 \), \( r = 0.02 \), and \( n = 3 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, we determine how much money Sara will earn from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara also has $10 saved before she starts babysitting. Therefore, her total savings before mowing any lawns is:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

To find out how much more money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes, we subtract her current savings from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40, we divide $40 by $4:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.",10,10
mgsm-en-211,"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3r \). Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

According to the problem, Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of eggs collected:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

First, we expand the equation:

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of customers counted on the third day. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250

Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. To verify, we can find the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]
Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons and the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons. Checking the condition from 4 minutes ago:
\[ 48 = 2 \times 24 \]

mgsm-en-226,"First, let's determine the initial number of each type of Pokemon card James has:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Next, we account for the changes in the number of cards:
- James loses 8 water type cards:
  \[
  40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards}
  \]
- James buys 14 grass type cards:
  \[
  20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[
30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ total cards}
\]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula for percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33

First, let's list all the components of the burrito and their respective costs:
- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 \times 2 = $0.50
- Upgrade (chips and a drink): $3.00

Now, we sum these costs:
\[
6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00

\]

Next, we calculate the combined rate at which they can place pieces together. Since Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute and her mom places 2 pieces per minute, their combined rate is:

\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Adding the tax to the cost of the cars gives us the total cost before registration:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Now, we need to add the registration fee. The registration fee is $1000 per car, and since Mark is buying 12 cars, the total registration fee is:
\[ 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Adding the registration fee to the total cost before registration gives us the final amount Mark pays:
\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[ \boxed{276000} \]",276000,

\]
So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, we find one-third of the 36 penguins that go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12

So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we add the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went into the cave to find the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing:
\[
12 + 12 = 24

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. At this point, he has 25 pens.
2. **Using Pens to Make New Pens**: Each time Ram uses a pen, he can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. This means that for every 5 pens used, he gets 1 new pen.

Let's calculate how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he initially has:
- After using the first 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. Now he has 20 pens left (25 - 5 + 1 = 21).
- After using the next 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. Now he has 16 pens left (21 - 5 + 1 = 17).
- After using the next 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. Now he has 12 pens left (17 - 5 + 1 = 13).
- After using the next 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. Now he has 8 pens left (13 - 5 + 1 = 9).
- After using the next 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. Now he has 4 pens left (9 - 5 + 1 = 5).
- After using the next 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. Now he has 0 pens left (5 - 5 + 1 = 1).

So, Ram can make a total of 5 new pens from the initial 25 pens. Adding these new pens to the initial 25 pens, the total number of pens Ram has is:

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives from each pen pal per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since Mike has 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives from all pen pals per week is:
\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages in response. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses for her own consumption and baking. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day, and she uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day. Therefore, the total number of eggs used by Janet each day is:
\[
3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs}
\]

To find out how many eggs Janet has left to sell at the farmers' market, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[
16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs}
\]

Janet sells these remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the eggs each day is:
\[
9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \(\boxed{18}\).",18,18

1. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \(\boxed{3}\).",3,3

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Cost of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
   - To find 150% of the original house value: \( 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \)
   - New value of the house: \( 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.

polymath-low-en-5,"To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to account for the discount on every second glass. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the cost of the first glass and the discounted cost of the second glass.
   - The cost of one glass is $5.
   - The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

2. Determine the number of glasses that are at full price and the number of glasses that are at the discounted price.
   - Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, half of them will be at full price and the other half will be at the discounted price.
   - Therefore, 8 glasses will be at full price and 8 glasses will be at the discounted price.

3. Calculate the total cost for the glasses at full price.
   - The cost for 8 glasses at $5 each is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.

4. Calculate the total cost for the glasses at the discounted price.

polymath-low-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then find the difference between this distance and the distance he needs to travel to get home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels before he turns around:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the distance John travels after he turns around. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he does not travel any distance during this time. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours at 80 mph. The remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
So, the distance he travels in this time is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding up all the distances he has traveled after turning around:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance John has traveled from his home is the sum of the distance he traveled before turning around and the distance he traveled after turning around:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 135 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he initially traveled 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[ 315 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is \(\boxed{135}\).",135,45
polymath-low-en-9,"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked.

1. **Calculate the regular pay:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   \[
   \text{Regular pay} = 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the overtime pay:**
   - Overtime is paid at 1.2 times the regular rate.
   - The regular rate is $10 per hour.
   \[
   \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]
   - Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   \[

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the first month} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. First, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of 180} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this amount from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - 54 = 126

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's define the variables and the costs and revenues involved:
- Initial cost to plant the tree: $90
- Cost to water and feed the tree each year: $3
- Number of lemons the tree grows each year: 7
- Selling price of each lemon: $1.5

Next, we calculate the net profit for each year:
- Revenue from selling lemons each year: \(7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5\)
- Net profit each year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5\)

Now, we need to find the number of years, \(n\), it takes for the total net profit to equal or exceed the initial cost of planting the tree. The total net profit after \(n\) years is given by:
\[ \text{Total net profit} = 7.5n \]

We set this equal to the initial cost to find the break-even point:
\[ 7.5n = 90 \]

Solving for \(n\):
\[ n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Thus, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree.",12,13
polymath-low-en-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, we know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left after the green house.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left after the red house.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

To clear the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 3:

\[
2x = 36
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 18

First, let's find the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The time difference between these two times is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.",0,8
polymath-low-en-24,"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the price before the 25% discount was applied. Let's denote the original price of the book by \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Thus, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
polymath-low-en-25,"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she definitely ordered: the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.

1. The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the remaining amount must be the cost of the boxes of pizza. We can find this by subtracting the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Thus, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza.",2,2
polymath-low-en-26,"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
\[
\text{Total cost of shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
\[
\text{Total cost of pants} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
\[
\text{Total cost of shoes} = 3 \times 42 = 126
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of shorts} + \text{Total cost of pants} + \text{Total cost of shoes}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 126 = 243
\]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is \(\boxed{243}\) dollars.",243,243
polymath-low-en-27,"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

First, we know that Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings. So, the number of cartons required is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16
polymath-low-en-28,"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip.
2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop.
3. Determine the distance traveled after the second stop.
4. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry first stopped after traveling 20 miles. This means he traveled 20 miles before his first stop.

Next, we need to find out how many miles he had left to travel after his first stop. Since the total distance is 60 miles and he had already traveled 20 miles, the remaining distance is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, he had traveled:
\[ 40 - 15 = 25 \text{ miles} \]
after his first stop.

Thus, the distance traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

polymath-low-en-29,"To determine the cost of the boots, let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33 and the cost of the other pair is twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of high heels is:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104
polymath-low-en-30,"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to find their current ages based on the given ratio and total age.

1. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.
2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
5. Now, calculate Allen's current age:
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-en-31,"To find the average guess of Gunter's friends, we first need to determine each of their individual guesses and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and adding 20 to that gives:
   \[
   40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
