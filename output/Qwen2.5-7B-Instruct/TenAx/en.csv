mgsm-en-47,"First, we determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]
Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties. Since each red tie costs $60 and he bought 10 red ties, the total cost for the red ties is:
\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]
The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire.",8,8
mgsm-en-49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[
15 \times 8 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = \frac{3 \times 120}{4} = \frac{360}{4} = 90
\]

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[
120 - 90 = 30
\]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-en-50,"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs per week.

First, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week and the chickens produce 252 eggs per day, the weekly production is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly egg production into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens produced per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, the weekly revenue is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week.",294,294

mgsm-en-52,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is:

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Friday is:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The total revenue for Friday is:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
\[
520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags that amount corresponds to.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required for these 180 cups. Since each bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is \(\boxed{2}\).",2,5

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Each package contains 3 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Each package contains 2 flowers.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.00.
- The savings by buying at the better price is \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \) dollars.

1. Identify Grace's weight.
2. Calculate Alex's weight based on the given relationship.
3. Add Grace's and Alex's weights together.

First, we know that Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Next, we calculate Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]
Substituting Grace's weight into the equation, we get:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

1. **Initial Salary:**
   Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.

2. **Salary After 5 Years:**
   Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, her salary will be increased by 10% of the initial salary.
   \[
   \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + 0.10 \times 600 = 600 + 60 = 660
   \]
   Therefore, her monthly salary after 5 years is $660.

3. **Salary After 6 Years:**
   After the first year of the increase, her salary will be increased by another 10%.
   \[
   \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + 0.10 \times 660 = 660 + 66 = 726

   Therefore, her monthly salary after 6 years is $726.

4. **Salary After 7 Years:**
   After the second year of the increase, her salary will be increased by another 10%.
   \[
   \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + 0.10 \times 726 = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6

- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James's age: \( 10 \) (since it is given that James is 10 years old)

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 10 = C - 1 \)

First, we solve for Corey's age using the third piece of information:

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have driven through, so the number of cars remaining is \( 30 - x \). Then, 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars that remain in the traffic jam is \( 30 - x - 5 = 25 - x \).

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the number of cars remaining after the first 15 minutes minus the 5 cars that took an exit, we can set up the following equation:

mgsm-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast.
- John has a glass of water with lunch.
- John has a glass of water with dinner.
- John has a glass of water before bed.

This means each weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast.
- John has a glass of water with lunch.
- John has a glass of water with dinner (but it's a soda, not water).
- John has a glass of water before bed.

This means each weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, we sum the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
mgsm-en-103,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile. Since 10 minutes are needed for 3 miles, the time to cover 1 mile is:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles. We multiply the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42:
\[
42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes}

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Volume is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.
   \[
   \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3.

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72
mgsm-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and subtract the hours he watched on the other days.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour (1-hour episode) + 0.5 hours (30-minute show) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours (2 one-hour episodes)

Next, we sum the hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours watched on Wednesday can be calculated by subtracting the hours watched on the other days from the total:
\[
7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours. To find the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday, we divide the total hours watched on Wednesday by the duration of one 30-minute episode:
\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

   Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \text{Number of photographs on Jamal's phone} = 6 \times \text{Number of photographs on Brittany's phone}
   \]
   Let \( B \) be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Then:
   \[
   1800 = 6B
   \]
   Solving for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Let \( D \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Then:

mgsm-en-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it. We will then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - She has 10 boards.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of 2x4x10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
   \]

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - She has 5 boards.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of 4x4x10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
   \]

3. **Total cost of all boards:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180
   \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.

1. **Revenue from 2x4x10 boards:**
   - The price has increased by 50%, so the new price is:
   \[
   \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \text{ per board}
   \]
   - She has 10 boards.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from 2x4x10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
   \]

2. **Revenue from 4x4x10 boards:**
   - The price has increased by 50%, so the new price is:
   \[
   \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24 \text{ per board}
   \]
   - She has 5 boards.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from 4x4x10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
   \]

3. **Total revenue from all boards:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$150 + \$120 = \$270
   \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$270 - \$180 = \$90

Thus, Sasha's profit is \(\boxed{90}\).",90,90
mgsm-en-116,"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is therefore \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. This total is the sum of the parts of the ratio. Therefore, each part of the ratio corresponds to \(\frac{120}{20} = 6\) teaspoons.

Since the amount of sugar used corresponds to 7 parts of the ratio, we can calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the number of parts for sugar by the value of each part:

First, we know that on the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know that on the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000 and that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

Next, we need to find Adrien's current salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it increased by 40% four years later. So, Adrien's current salary is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary, her current salary is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

mgsm-en-123,"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on her running speeds.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie can run in the first 3 hours. Since she runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours, we use the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much time is left after the first 3 hours. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time is:
\[
7 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}

During these remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours is:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}
\]

To find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours, we add the two distances together:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles}

Next, we determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total amount spent on video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the amount of money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left should equal the total amount of money he had from selling the lego sets. We can verify this by adding the money spent on video games and the money left:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total amount of money John had was $195, and he spent $165, we can confirm that the calculations are correct. The problem asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She placed one Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After placing the Post-it notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

4. **Post-it Notes in the Package**: Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them at work:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]

5. **Solve the Equation**:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 80 - 220 + x = -140 + x
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   -140 + x = 23
   \]
   Add 140 to both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 23 + 140

polymath-low-en-47,"First, we determine the number of blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]
Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]
The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total amount is the sum of the money she started with and the money she received from her allowance. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Bailey started with is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the students.

First, let's find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes each day on the weekdays (Monday through Friday) and 8 classes on Saturday. The number of classes she teaches from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]
Adding the classes on Saturday:
\[ 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is:
\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from the students. Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total revenue is:
\[ 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:

polymath-low-en-72,"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie for $3.
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each slice of cheesecake for $4.
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the revenues from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money raised:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest charged.
3. Determine the total amount to be paid.
4. Calculate the monthly payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.**

Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each.
\[
\text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total interest charged.**

The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:
\[
\text{Total interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount to be paid.**

The total amount to be paid is the sum of the total cost before interest and the total interest.
\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = 765
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the monthly payment.**

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months.
\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255

- Marigolds are sold for $2.74 per pot. Rounding $2.74 to the nearest dollar gives us $3.
- Petunias are sold for $1.87 per pot. Rounding $1.87 to the nearest dollar gives us $2.
- Begonias are sold for $2.12 per pot. Rounding $2.12 to the nearest dollar gives us $2.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each type of flower.

- For marigolds: \(12 \text{ pots} \times \$3 \text{ per pot} = \$36\).
- For petunias: \(9 \text{ pots} \times \$2 \text{ per pot} = \$18\).

polymath-low-en-75,"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level as \( L_1 \), the square footage of the second level as \( L_2 \), the square footage of the third level as \( L_3 \), and the square footage of the fourth level as \( L_4 \).

Given:
\[ L_1 = 16 \]

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it:
\[ L_2 = \frac{L_1}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ L_3 = \frac{L_2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ L_4 = \frac{L_3}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we have the square footage of all four levels:
\[ L_1 = 16 \]
\[ L_2 = 8 \]
\[ L_3 = 4 \]
\[ L_4 = 2 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + L_4}{4} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

polymath-low-en-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days and then convert that into the number of bags.

First, we know that the puppy will eat 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining days of the first year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days remaining after the first 180 days is:
\[ 365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days} \]
The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food every day for these 185 days. So, the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \times 2 = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding the dog food consumed in the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days gives us the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 + 370 = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since each bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 550 cups of dog food. We do this by dividing the total amount of dog food by the amount per bag:
\[ \frac{550}{110} = 5 \]
Since the result is a whole number, Cecilia will use exactly 5 bags of dog food in the first year. Therefore, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:

polymath-low-en-77,"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we start by defining the amount of laundry each person does in terms of David's laundry.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does is:
\[
4D
\]

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
4D = 400
\]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
\]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, the amount of laundry Raymond does is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 4D = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200
\]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[
200 - 100 = 100
\]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\).",100,100

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
\[
\text{Number of packages needed} = \frac{18}{3} = 6

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00
\]

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:
\[

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses for her own consumption and for baking. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day, and she uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. Therefore, the total number of eggs used by Janet each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many eggs are left for sale at the farmers' market, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount of money she makes from selling the eggs each day is:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of $130,000 and add it to the original total cost. 

First, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Next, we add this increase to the original total cost:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (including repairs) from the new value of the house:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

   - Since she downloads at a rate of 2 GB per minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

2. **Account for the restart and installation of updates:**
   - The restart and installation of updates take 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the amount of data left to download after the restart:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start from the beginning again, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB file.
   - Since she has already downloaded 80 GB, she needs to download \(200 - 80 = 120\) GB.

\]

Next, we determine how far John travels back towards home in the first 2 hours of his return trip. Since he is stuck in traffic, he does not move during this time:
\[
\text{Distance} = 0 \, \text{miles}
\]

After the 2 hours of standstill traffic, John drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph:
\[

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, after selling to the red house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. After selling at the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left, which is equal to 5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

mgsm-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total running time per week:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. Therefore, he runs:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours per day}
     \]
   - The total running time for the other two days is:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Adding the running time for all three days:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate John's running speed:**
   - John runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours.
   - Speed is calculated as distance divided by time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Thus, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10
mgsm-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to first find her walking and running speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she travels while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles.",18,18

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Purchased**: Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.
3. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
4. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: She had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of Post-it notes she had initially, added the ones she purchased, and subtracted the ones she used, which should equal the remaining Post-it notes.

\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
80 + x - 220 = 80 - 220 + x = -140 + x
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
-140 + x = 23
\]

To isolate \( x \), add 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[
-140 + x + 140 = 23 + 140

   Carl ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week, and each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese, each omelet uses:
   \[
   2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for omelets is:
   \[
   3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

Adding up all the slices of cheese used:
\[
14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}
\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\).",31,31

3. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   Let \( C \) be the cost of one dozen cups. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
   \[
   20C
   \]

4. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, we can write:

mgsm-en-210,"First, we calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, we determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara also has $10 saved before she starts babysitting. Adding her savings to her babysitting earnings gives:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes. The total cost is $70, and she currently has $30, so the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.",10,10
mgsm-en-211,"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

The red chickens produce 3 eggs each per day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3r \). The white chickens produce 5 eggs each per day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

According to the problem, Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of eggs collected:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

First, we expand the equation:

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

To isolate \( r \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[
8r = 32

   The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[

mgsm-en-213,"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers counted over the three days to find the number of customers counted on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. So, the number of customers on the first day is:
\[ 100 \]

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

mgsm-en-214,"Let's denote the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons and the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, the problem also states that the big pool currently has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. To verify, we can find the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]
Four minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons. Indeed, 48 is twice 24, which confirms our solution is correct.

Thus, the amount of water in the small pool now is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,8

So, the total amount to be returned is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month, so the total payment over 12 months is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:

\text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$2.00 = \$8.50
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$8.50 + \$1.00 = \$9.50
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$9.50 + \$1.00 = \$10.50

mgsm-en-228,"First, we need to determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces together. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which means her mom can place \(4 / 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

Next, we calculate their combined rate. Since Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute and her mom places 2 pieces per minute, together they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Thus, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle.",1,1
mgsm-en-229,"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months.
2. Determine the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest.
3. Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Determine the number of watermelons remaining after the second harvest.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months.**

The farm initially produced 120 watermelons. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

**Step 2: Determine the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest.**

Subtract the number of watermelons harvested from the initial number of watermelons.
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons remained after the first harvest.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks.**

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

**Step 4: Determine the number of watermelons remaining after the second harvest.**

Subtract the number of watermelons harvested from the remaining watermelons.
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]
So, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

The final answer is:

   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the cars is:

3. **Calculate the total registration fee:**
   The registration fee for each car is $1,000, and there are 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000

polymath-low-en-84,"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

polymath-low-en-98,"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have driven through, so the number of cars remaining is \( 30 - x \). Then, 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars left in the traffic jam is \( 30 - x - 5 = 25 - x \).

In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). This must be equal to the number of cars remaining after the first 15 minutes and before the 5 cars took an exit, which is \( 25 - x \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 - x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add \( x \) to both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x + 20 = 25 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 5 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \]

Since the number of cars must be a whole number, and typically in such problems, we assume the context allows for fractional cars (which might be due to a misinterpretation or simplification in the problem setup), we conclude that the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{2.5} \).",5,5
polymath-low-en-99,"First, we calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we account for the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday. Adding these to her existing plants, the total number of potted plants she has now is:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Since she has 2 potted plants on each ledge, she can give 1 potted plant from each ledge, leaving her with 1 potted plant per ledge. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \]

Subtracting the number of potted plants she gives away from her current total, the number of potted plants she will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(\boxed{58}\).",58,58
polymath-low-en-100,"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\).",175,175

\[ 4 \text{ (Science)} + 20 \text{ (Social Studies)} + 7 \text{ (History)} + 8 \text{ (Geography)} = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we determine how many pages Solo still needs to read after Monday. Since he read 15 pages on Monday, the remaining pages are:
\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Thus, Solo needs to read \(\boxed{6}\) pages on average each day.",6,6
polymath-low-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed.
- This means he drinks 4 glasses of water each weekday.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends:
- On weekends, John still has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but he has a soda with dinner instead of water.
- This means he drinks 3 glasses of water each day on the weekend.

Since there are 2 days in the weekend, the total number of glasses of water he drinks on the weekend is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we sum the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends to get the total for the week:

The problem states that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile. Since 10 minutes are required to cover 3 miles, the time to cover 1 mile is:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we need to find the total time to cover 42 miles. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42:
\[
42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes}

\[
\text{Number of cookies Cody eats} = 3 \times \text{Number of cookies Amir eats} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

Next, we find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir by adding the number of cookies each one eats:
\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = \text{Number of cookies Cody eats} + \text{Number of cookies Amir eats} = 15 + 5 = 20

polymath-low-en-106,"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of each box are reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Width: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as:
\[

polymath-low-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and then isolate the time spent on Wednesday.

First, let's summarize the time spent on TV for each day:
- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- **Friday**: 2 hours

Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is equivalent to 0.5 hours. Therefore, the total time spent watching TV on Wednesday is \( 0.5x \) hours.

The total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday is given as 7 hours. We can set up the following equation to represent the total time:

\[
1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7
\]

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{x \text{ feet}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   16x = 64 \times 20

\[ 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each 4 x 4 x 10 board was $16, and she has five of these boards. Therefore, the total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total original cost of the lumber:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the current price of the lumber. Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of each 2 x 4 x 10 board is:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
And the new price of each 4 x 4 x 10 board is:
\[ 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]
And the total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total selling price of the lumber:
\[ 150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

polymath-low-en-124,"To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped:**
   Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie's work:**
   Jennie added 20 new stamped letters to the existing pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after her work, there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie's work} = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before Jennie's work:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began. After adding 20 new stamped letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile became 30.
   \[
   x + 20 = 30

mgsm-en-236,"To determine how many total pens Ram can have, we need to follow the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. These are the pens he starts with.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using the 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. Therefore, from 25 pens, he can make \(\frac{25}{5} = 5\) new pens.
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 5 pens he made from the first cycle, giving him a total of 10 pens. From these 10 pens, he can make \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) new pens.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 2 new pens plus the 2 pens he made from the second cycle, giving him a total of 4 pens. From these 4 pens, he can make \(\frac{4}{5} = 0\) new pens (since 4 is less than 5).

So, the total number of pens he can have is the sum of the pens he initially bought and the pens he made in each cycle:
\[ 25 + 5 + 2 = 32 \]

Thus, the total number of pens Ram can have is \(\boxed{32}\).",32,31

mgsm-en-238,"To determine the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by identifying the age of each individual based on the given relationships.

First, we know that Jessa is 20 years old:
\[ \text{Jessa's age} = 20 \]

Next, we are told that Joan is five years older than Jessa:
\[ \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Then, we are informed that Mary is two years younger than Joan:
\[ \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa by adding their ages together:
\[ \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68 \]

mgsm-en-242,"First, we determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them, he has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. The time it takes for Mike to write one page is 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing a week is:

\[30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Initially, Griffin has 24 fries. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has:
\[ 24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries} \]

Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy takes:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries} \]
After Billy takes his fries, Griffin has:
\[ 19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries} \]

Next, Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and then Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby takes:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries} \]
After Colby takes his fries, Griffin has:
\[ 9 + x - 2 = 27 \]
where \( x \) is the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. Simplifying the equation, we get:

4. Calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate over the two days.
5. Determine the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.
6. Find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister.

First, we know that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate is:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, we have:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, we have:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \]

Now, we find the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \]

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister. Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue's sister is:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \]
And the total calories consumed by Sue is:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

polymath-low-en-8,"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then find the difference between this distance and the distance he needs to travel to get home.

First, let's calculate the distance John traveled to the point where he turned around:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the distance John traveled after turning around. He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he did not travel any distance during this time. Then he drove for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drove for the remaining time of 4 hours minus the 2 hours in standstill traffic and 0.5 hours of driving at 30 mph:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
He drove at 80 mph for these 1.5 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances John traveled:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John traveled 180 miles away from home and then 315 miles in the opposite direction, the net distance from home is:
\[ 315 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% from the number of downloads in the second month. First, we calculate 30% of 180.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this amount from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts costs $68.

\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 68 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 3 \times 68 = 204 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.

\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \text{ dozen} \times 80 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.

\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 55 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 6 \times 55 = 330 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of donuts} + \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 204 \text{ dollars} + 160 \text{ dollars} + 330 \text{ dollars} = 694 \text{ dollars}

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's define the variables and the annual costs and revenues:
- Initial cost to plant the tree: $90
- Number of lemons grown per year: 7
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3

The net profit each year is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = (\text{Number of lemons} \times \text{Selling price per lemon}) - \text{Annual cost} \]
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = (7 \times 1.5) - 3 = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \]

Now, we need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the total net profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of $90:
\[ \text{Total net profit after } n \text{ years} = 7.5n \]
We set this equal to the initial cost and solve for \( n \):
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years to start earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13
polymath-low-en-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, we know that Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \]

We know that after the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners.",18,18

polymath-low-en-15,"To determine which purchase plan will yield the maximum profit, we need to calculate the value of each item after a month, given the market growth rates.

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a month. The jewelry is worth $5,000 and the market is expected to rise by 2.5%. The new value of the jewelry can be calculated as follows:
\[
5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]
So, the value of the jewelry after a month is $5125.

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a month. The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000 and the market is expected to rise by 1.2%. The new value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as follows:
\[
8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]
So, the value of the electronic gadgets after a month is $8096.

Now, we compare the two values to determine which purchase plan yields the maximum profit. The profit from the jewelry is:
\[
5125 - 5000 = 125
\]
The profit from the electronic gadgets is:
\[
8096 - 8000 = 96

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
mgsm-en-141,"Let's denote the number of queens as \( q \). According to the problem, the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens, so we can denote the number of baby bees as \( 2q \). Additionally, the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so we can denote the number of worker bees as \( 2 \times 2q = 4q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7q = 700 \]
To find \( q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\).",400,400

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour, we calculate the total earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is \(\boxed{140}\).",140,140
mgsm-en-143,"First, we identify the costs of each item John buys:

Adding the tax to the nonfood items:
\[
7 + 0.7 = 7.7 \text{ dollars}

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths needed. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]
And the total number of packs of cloths needed is:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5. So, the total cost for the bleach is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \]
And the total cost for the cloths is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
Therefore, the total expenses are:
\[ 32 + 40 = 72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests per year and then by the total number of hectares.

First, we know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests per year is:
\[
\frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year:
\[
100 \text{ pineapples/hectare/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year}

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = 440 \text{ feet per minute} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Distance} = 2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = 264 \text{ feet per minute} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The time difference between Tim and Steve is:

Thus, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times.",5,5
mgsm-en-167,"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \). Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age can be expressed as \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as the following equation:
\[
(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
\]
\[
3B + 4 = 28
\]
Next, we isolate \( B \) by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Then, we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
B = 8
\]
So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:
\[
2B = 2 \times 8 = 16

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, we convert the peeling time into seconds:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 × 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, we calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes:
- Total peeling time = 90 seconds/potato × 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, we calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes:
- Total cutting time = 5 seconds/potato × 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Finally, we add the total peeling time and the total cutting time to find the total prep time:
- Total prep time = 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds

To convert the total prep time into minutes:

mgsm-en-175,"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of lemons and sugar.
   - The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost: \( \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).
   - Therefore, \( 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).

2. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of glasses sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.
   - The total revenue is \( 0.50x \).

3. **Express the total cost in terms of the number of gallons made:**
   - Let \( g \) be the number of gallons made.
   - Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is \( 5g \).

4. **Relate the number of glasses sold to the number of gallons made:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, \( x = 20g \).

5. **Substitute \( x \) and \( C \) into the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( x = 20g \) and \( C = 5g \) into \( 25 = 0.50x - C \):
     \[
     25 = 0.50(20g) - 5g

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Calculate \( 0.50 \times 20g \):
     \[
     25 = 10g - 5g
     \]
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     25 = 5g

\]
\[
\text{Earnings for the first week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}

- Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 runners.

\[
\text{Total time for the well-rounded team} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}

First, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the hamsters and the rabbits, and then use that information to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the rats.

1. **Calculate the straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Calculate the straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw used for the rabbits is 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the straw used for the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Subtract the straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits from the total straw distributed to find out how much was used for the rats.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats is \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the number of rats is \(\frac{90}{6} = 15\).
   - Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is \(\frac{15}{3} = 5\).

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5
