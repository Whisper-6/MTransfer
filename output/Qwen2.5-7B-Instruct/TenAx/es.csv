mgsm-es-47,"First, we translate the question into English:

""John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine the number of blue ties John bought.
   - The cost of each blue tie is $40.
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - The number of blue ties is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
     \]

2. Determine the number of red ties John bought.
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Since he bought 5 blue ties, the number of red ties is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

3. Determine the cost of each red tie.
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - The cost of each blue tie is $40.
   - The cost of each red tie is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]

4. Determine the total cost of the red ties.
   - John bought 10 red ties, and each red tie costs $60.
   - The total cost of the red ties is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

5. Determine the total amount spent on ties.
   - John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties.
   - The total amount spent is:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
     \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

mgsm-es-50,"Translation: Lloyd has a poultry farm. The hens lay 252 eggs per day and he sells them at $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd earn per week from selling eggs?

Para resolver este problema, primero necesitamos calcular cuántas docenas de huevos ponen los gallos por día, luego multiplicar por el número de días en una semana para obtener la cantidad total de docenas vendidas por semana, y finalmente multiplicar por el precio por docena.

1. Primero, calculamos cuántas docenas de huevos ponen los gallos por día:
   \[
   \text{Docenas diarias} = \frac{252 \text{ huevos}}{12 \text{ huevos por docena}} = 21 \text{ docenas}
   \]

2. Luego, calculamos cuántas docenas de huevos ponen los gallos por semana:
   \[
   \text{Docenas semanales} = 21 \text{ docenas/día} \times 7 \text{ días/semana} = 147 \text{ docenas/semana}

mgsm-es-53,"Question in English: A mechanic charges different rates for repairing truck and car tires. For each truck tire repaired, the mechanic charges $60, and for each car tire repaired, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and none of truck tires. How many more earnings did the mechanic have on the day with the highest earnings?

To determine the earnings on each day, we first calculate the total earnings for Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires repaired: 6
- Car tires repaired: 4
- Earnings from truck tires: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars
- Earnings from car tires: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars
- Total earnings on Thursday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars

**Friday:**
- Truck tires repaired: 0
- Car tires repaired: 12
- Earnings from truck tires: \(0 \times 60 = 0\) dollars
- Earnings from car tires: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars
- Total earnings on Friday: \(0 + 480 = 480\) dollars

Now, we compare the earnings from Thursday and Friday:
- Thursday: 520 dollars
- Friday: 480 dollars

The difference in earnings between the two days is:
\[520 - 480 = 40\]

Therefore, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday.",40,40
mgsm-es-54,"Question in English: The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens that they adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to tell them that their two domestic cats just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had three times the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family have now?

To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of adopted kittens: 7.
2. Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has: Since Patchy has three times the number of adopted kittens, we multiply 7 by 3.

""Peter plans to go to the movies this week. He always buys a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has $42 to spend this week, how many times can he go to the movies?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine the cost of one trip to the movies.
   - The cost of a ticket is $7.
   - The cost of popcorn is $7.
   - Therefore, the total cost for one trip is $7 + $7 = $14.

2. Determine how many times Peter can go to the movies with $42.
   - We need to divide the total amount of money Peter has by the cost of one trip.
   - So, we calculate $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times. The final answer is:

mgsm-es-57,"Translation: A wooden bridge cannot support more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will cross the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
2. Determine how many boxes can be loaded based on the remaining weight capacity.

First, we find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:
\[ 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded with the remaining 1245 pounds. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:
\[ \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \text{ boxes} \]

mgsm-es-58,"Question in English: Stephen placed an online order for groceries. The final invoice was for $40.00. Since the order was placed through a delivery service, they added a 25% surcharge on the total final amount and charged $3.00 for shipping. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. After the extra charges, what was the final price of Stephen's grocery purchase?

To find the final price of Stephen's grocery purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the surcharge on the total final amount.
2. Add the shipping cost.
3. Add the tip.
4. Sum all these amounts to get the final price.

Let's start with the surcharge. The surcharge is 25% of the final invoice amount of $40.00. We calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Surcharge} = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

Next, we add the shipping cost of $3.00 to the surcharge:
\[ \text{Total after surcharge and shipping} = 40.00 + 10.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]

Finally, we add the tip of $4.00:
\[ \text{Final price} = 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

mgsm-es-60,"Translation: A basket contains 25 oranges, of which 1 is in poor condition, 20% have not yet ripened, 2 are sour, and the rest are in good condition. How many oranges are in good condition?

To determine the number of oranges in good condition, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of oranges that are not in good condition.
2. Subtract the number of oranges that are not in good condition from the total number of oranges.

First, we know that 1 orange is in poor condition. Next, we need to calculate the number of oranges that have not yet ripened. Since 20% of the 25 oranges have not yet ripened, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, 5 oranges have not yet ripened. We also know that 2 oranges are sour. Therefore, the total number of oranges that are not in good condition is:

\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not in good condition from the total number of oranges to find the number of oranges that are in good condition:

\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \]

Thus, the number of oranges in good condition is \(\boxed{17}\).",17,17

Starting from the age of 20, she has the right to 5% of the value of the pension for each year worked. If she resigns after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work, we need to calculate 5% of the $50,000 annual pension for each year she worked. Since she has worked for 30 years, we will calculate 5% of $50,000 for 30 years.

The calculation is as follows:
\[ \text{Annual pension} = 50,000 \times 0.05 \times 30 \]

First, calculate 5% of $50,000:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

Next, multiply this amount by the number of years she worked (30 years):
\[ 2,500 \times 30 = 75,000 \]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work will be \(\boxed{75000}\).",75000,25000

If the streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her 10% less for the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she will have paid for the streaming service at the end of the year.

Primero, calculemos el costo para la primera mitad del año. Como el servicio cuesta $140 por mes, para 6 meses (la primera mitad del año) el costo será:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dólares} \]

A continuación, calculemos el costo para la segunda mitad del año. El costo por mes en la segunda mitad del año es 10% menos que el costo original, por lo que el costo por mes en la segunda mitad del año será:
\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dólares} \]
Para 6 meses (la segunda mitad del año), el costo será:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dólares} \]

Ahora, sumemos los costos de la primera y la segunda mitad del año para obtener el monto total pagado al final del año:

El manual del propietario de su automóvil dice que en el tanque entran 12 galones de gasolina. ¿Cuántas millas puede hacer Sophia con un solo tanque de gasolina?

To determine how many miles Sophia can drive with a full tank of gas, we need to calculate her miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out how far she can go with a full 12-gallon tank.

First, we know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her miles per gallon is:
\[
\text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each school has sent a women's basketball team and a men's basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school has also sent a coach for each team.
4. Therefore, each school has sent 2 teams, with 5 players each, and 2 coaches.

Let's calculate the total number of people sent by each school:

mgsm-es-75,"Question in English: Luke spends his time building sandcastles on the beach. Over time, he notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage of the level below it. If he builds a 4-level sandcastle, where the top level has an area of 16 square feet, what will be the average square footage per level of the sandcastle?

To find the average square footage per level of the sandcastle, we first need to determine the area of each level. Let's denote the area of the top level (4th level) as \( A_4 \), the area of the 3rd level as \( A_3 \), the area of the 2nd level as \( A_2 \), and the area of the 1st level as \( A_1 \).

Given:
- \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet
- Each level has half the area of the level below it.

So, we can calculate the areas of the other levels as follows:
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we have the areas of all four levels:
\[ A_1 = 128 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_3 = 32 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average square footage per level, we sum the areas of all the levels and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the average square footage per level of the sandcastle is \(\boxed{60}\).",60,60
mgsm-es-76,"Question in English: Cecilia just bought a new puppy. According to the veterinarian, she has to feed the puppy with 1 cup of dog food every day during the first 180 days. Then, she has to feed the puppy with 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If a bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use during the first year?

Para responder a la pregunta, primero calculamos cuántas tazas de alimento necesita el cachorro durante los primeros 365 días (un año completo).

1. Durante los primeros 180 días, el cachorro necesita 1 taza de alimento por día:
   \[
   180 \text{ días} \times 1 \text{ taza/día} = 180 \text{ tazas}
   \]

2. Restamos los primeros 180 días del año para calcular cuántos días quedan:
   \[
   365 \text{ días} - 180 \text{ días} = 185 \text{ días}
   \]

3. Durante los 185 días restantes, el cachorro necesita 2 tazas de alimento por día:

""If Raymond washes half the amount of laundry that Sarah washes, and Sarah washes 4 times the amount of laundry that David washes, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash if Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We know that Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah washes 4 times the amount of laundry that David washes. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David washes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of laundry David washes} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond washes half the amount of laundry that Sarah washes. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond washes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of laundry Raymond washes} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash:
   \[

Vincent can buy flowers in bunches of 3 for $2.50 or in bunches of 2 for $1. How much money does he save if he buys 18 flowers at the best price?

**Answer:**
Primero, determinamos el costo por flor en cada opción:
- Si compra en ramos de 3 por $2.50, el costo por flor es $\frac{2.50}{3} \approx 0.8333$.
- Si compra en ramos de 2 por $1, el costo por flor es $\frac{1}{2} = 0.50$.

Como $0.50 < 0.8333$, es más barato comprar en ramos de 2. Ahora, calculamos cuántos ramos de 2 flores necesita para obtener 18 flores:
\[
\frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ ramos}
\]
El costo total para 18 flores compradas en ramos de 2 es:
\[
9 \times 1 = 9 \text{ dólares}

The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of its employees by 10% of the initial salary each year for those who have been in the company for five years. If Sylvie just completed 5 years of service in December last year, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?

To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase step by step.

1. **Initial Salary:**
   \[
   \text{Initial monthly salary} = \$600
   \]
   \[
   \text{Initial annual salary} = 600 \times 12 = \$7200
   \]

2. **Salary after 5 years:**
   Since Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years, she qualifies for the 10% increase.
   \[
   \text{Salary increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New monthly salary after 5 years} = 600 + 60 = \$660

If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he wants it to be enough for everyone?

To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat. Since each adult will eat 10 pounds of potato salad and there are 20 adults:
\[
20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat. Since each child will eat half as much as an adult, each child will eat:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]
With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad that the children will eat is:
\[
5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding the amounts of potato salad for the adults and the children gives us the total amount of potato salad needed:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam:**
   - We know that 20 cars passed in the second 15 minutes.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cars that passed in the first 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

2. **Determine the initial number of cars and the number of cars that took an exit:**
   - Originally, there were 30 cars.
   - 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam.
   - Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

3. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   - We know that \( x + 20 = 25 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 25 - 20 = 5 \).

So, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

He only read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4 more days to complete all the reading, how many pages does he need to read on average per day?

To determine how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we first calculate the total number of pages he needs to read. This is the sum of the pages from each book:

\[ 4 \text{ (science)} + 20 \text{ (social studies)} + 7 \text{ (history)} + 8 \text{ (geography)} = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we subtract the number of pages he has already read from the total number of pages:

\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

He has 4 more days to read these remaining pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read per day on average, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages per day} \]

Therefore, the number of pages he needs to read on average per day is:

mgsm-es-107,"Question in English: Every night, Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched one 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched some episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he stayed up late for the weekend and watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in total, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday as \( x \). Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the total time spent watching TV on Wednesday is \( 0.5x \) hours.

The total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday is the sum of the time spent each day:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 0.5x = 2 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 0.5:
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Frankie watched \(\boxed{4}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.",30,3

""Henry is preparing cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to bake twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he intended. When he puts them to cool, he discards 5 of the cookies and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he wants to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After cooling, he discards 5 cookies, so he has \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left.
5. We know that after discarding 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   \[
   2x = 110 - 10
   \]
   \[
   2x = 100

It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore?

Primero, determinemos cuántos pies Julia remó en total. Sabemos que el tiempo total para llegar a la orilla es 64 segundos y que le llevó 16 segundos remar 20 pies. Por lo tanto, el tiempo por cada 20 pies es 16 segundos. Para encontrar la distancia total remada, calculamos:

\[
\text{Tiempo total} = 64 \text{ segundos}
\]
\[
\text{Tiempo por 20 pies} = 16 \text{ segundos}

If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photographs, how many ducks can be seen in the photograph that Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can store.
   Since Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can store 1800 photographs, we can write:
   \[
   1800 = 6 \times \text{(number of photographs Brittany's phone can store)}
   \]
   Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can store as \( B \). Then:
   \[
   1800 = 6B \implies B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
   So, Brittany's phone can store 300 photographs.

2. Determine the number of ducks in the photograph that Jamal took.
   According to the problem, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks in the photograph that Jamal took. Let's denote the number of ducks in the photograph that Jamal took as \( D \). Then:
   \[
   300 = 50D \implies D = \frac{300}{50} = 6

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts in the mixture is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since the sugar makes up 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, we can set up the following proportion to find the amount of sugar used:

\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120

Jennie is helping in her mother's office. She has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps and a pile of letters that already have stamps. She puts stamps on a third of the letters that need stamps. If now there are 30 letters in the pile that already have stamps, how many were there in that pile when Jennie started?

**Answer:**
Primero, determinamos cuántas cartas Jennie colocó estampillas. Dado que hay 60 cartas que necesitan estampillas y ella colocó estampillas en un tercio de ellas, calculamos:

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much money will he spend in total if each pepper costs $15?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying.

1. **Determine the cost of each pepper:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of each pepper} = \$15
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of each watermelon:**

Today, he took another test of 100 questions at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second, how many questions did he leave incomplete?

To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he answered in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark answered in the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions Mark answered in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:

Para resolver este problema, primero necesitamos determinar cuántas millas John corre en los otros dos días. Sabemos que en el primer día, John corre la mitad de la distancia que corre en los otros dos días juntos. Si denotamos la distancia que corre en los otros dos días juntos como \( x \), entonces la distancia que corre en el primer día es \( \frac{x}{2} \).

La suma de las distancias de los tres días es 60 millas:

polymath-low-es-39,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can jump at a speed that is half the speed at which she can run. If she can jump at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she runs for one-third of the time and walks for two-thirds of the time?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine Dana's running speed.
   Since Dana can jump at 3 miles per hour and this speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. Determine Dana's walking speed.
   Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. Calculate the time spent running and walking.
   Dana runs for one-third of the time and walks for two-thirds of the time in six hours. Therefore, the time spent running is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   and the time spent walking is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Calculate the distance traveled by running and walking.
   The distance traveled by running is:
   \[
   6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]
   The distance traveled by walking is:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. Calculate the total distance traveled.
   The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled by running and walking:
   \[
   12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

""The great dragon, Perg, sat on the top of Mount Farbo, spewing fire at everything within 1000 feet. Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only known weapon that could kill the dragon, up to 400 feet, well within the dragon's reach. But when Polly had the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when she didn't have it. How far away from the dragon's flames could Polly stand to be able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin while having the sapphire gemstone?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the sapphire gemstone.
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.
   - Therefore, the distance with the gemstone is \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) feet.

2. Determine the distance at which Polly can stand to be out of the dragon's flames but still be able to hit the dragon.
   - The dragon can spew fire up to 1000 feet.
   - Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone.
   - Therefore, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still be able to hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is \(\boxed{1000}\).",1000,200

She cut each pie into 8 slices and placed the five pies on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. At the end of the night, after the guests served themselves and ate the pie slices, there were 14 slices left. How many slices were served to the guests?

To find out how many slices were served to the guests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices of pie initially available.
2. Subtract the number of slices left at the end of the night from the initial number of slices.

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ slices per pie} = 40 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we subtract the number of slices left from the initial number of slices:
\[ 40 \text{ slices} - 14 \text{ slices left} = 26 \text{ slices served} \]

So, the number of slices served to the guests is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26

To determine how many grams of French fries can be eaten, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining calories available for the day.
2. Determine how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the number of servings into grams.

First, we find out how many calories are left for the day:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we determine how many servings can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of servings into grams. Since a 300 g bag contains 5 servings, we can find the weight per serving by dividing the total weight by the number of servings:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ g/serving} \]

Therefore, the number of grams that can be eaten is:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candles made.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles made.
Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax. If he makes 20 candles, he will use:
\[
\frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
\]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[
20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
\]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Since Charlie uses 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
\[
2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
\]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
The net profit is:
\[
\$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
\]

Therefore, the net profit is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20

At work, she placed one sticker on each of the 220 different coffee cups. If she has 23 stickers left, how many stickers were in the pack she bought?
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stickers were in the pack Candice bought. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers**: Candice started with 80 stickers.
2. **Stickers Used at Work**: She used one sticker per each of the 220 different coffee cups. So, she used 220 stickers at work.
3. **Stickers Left After Work**: After using 220 stickers, she has 23 stickers left.

Let's denote the number of stickers in the pack she bought as \( x \). The total number of stickers she had after buying the pack is \( 80 + x \). After using 220 stickers, the number of stickers left is \( 80 + x - 220 \). According to the problem, this number is 23. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

polymath-low-es-64,"Translation: Sophia está pensando en hacer un viaje en automóvil por la carretera y quisiera saber qué distancia puede recorrer con un solo tanque de gasolina. Ha recorrido 100 millas desde que llenó el tanque por última vez y debió ponerle 4 galones de gasolina para volver a llenarlo. El manual del propietario de su automóvil dice que en el tanque entran 12 galones de gasolina. ¿Cuántas millas puede hacer Sophia con un solo tanque de gasolina?

To determine how many miles Sophia can drive with a full tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out how many miles she can drive with a full 12-gallon tank.

First, we know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:
\[
\text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with a full 12-gallon tank. Using the fuel efficiency we calculated:
\[
\text{Distance with a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance Sophia can drive with a full tank of gas is:

Now, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each school has sent a women's basketball team and a men's basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school has also sent a coach for each team.

So, for each school:
- There are 5 players on the women's team.
- There are 5 players on the men's team.
- There is 1 coach for the women's team.
- There is 1 coach for the men's team.

This means each school has sent a total of:
\[ 5 \text{ (women's team players)} + 5 \text{ (men's team players)} + 1 \text{ (women's team coach)} + 1 \text{ (men's team coach)} = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \text{ (schools)} \times 12 \text{ (people per school)} = 48 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people that all the schools have sent is \(\boxed{48}\).",48,48

polymath-low-es-75,"Question in English: Luke spends his time building sandcastles on the beach. Over time, he notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the surface area in square feet of the level below it. If he builds a 4-level sandcastle, with the top level having a surface area of 16 square feet, what will be the average surface area in square feet of a level?

To solve the problem, we need to determine the surface area of each level of the sandcastle and then find the average surface area.

1. Let the surface area of the top level (4th level) be \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet.
2. The surface area of the 3rd level is \( A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \) square feet.
3. The surface area of the 2nd level is \( A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \) square feet.
4. The surface area of the 1st level is \( A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \) square feet.

Now, we have the surface areas of all four levels:
- 1st level: 128 square feet
- 2nd level: 64 square feet
- 3rd level: 32 square feet
- 4th level: 16 square feet

To find the average surface area, we sum these areas and divide by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average surface area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ square feet}

To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price plus repair costs) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs add $50,000 to the value of the house, and this increases the value by 150%. An increase of 150% means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The new value of the house is:

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:
   Since there are 4 times more sheep in Charleston than in Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80

Primero, calculemos cuánto tiempo tomaría descargar el archivo sin interrupciones:

1. El archivo es de 200 GB.
2. Carla descarga a una velocidad de 2 GB por minuto.

\[ \text{Tiempo total sin interrupciones} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minuto}} = 100 \text{ minutos} \]

Ahora, calculemos cuánto tiempo se detendrá la descarga debido a las interrupciones:

1. 40% del archivo es 40% de 200 GB, que es 80 GB.
2. La velocidad de descarga es 2 GB por minuto, por lo que el tiempo para descargar 80 GB es:

\[ \text{Tiempo para descargar 80 GB} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minuto}} = 40 \text{ minutos} \]

Durante este tiempo, Windows fuerza un reinicio que demora 20 minutos. Por lo tanto, cada vez que se produce una interrupción, Carla pierde 40 minutos de descarga real y 20 minutos de tiempo total.

El tiempo total de descarga, incluyendo las interrupciones, se puede calcular de la siguiente manera:

1. El tiempo total de descarga real es 100 minutos.
2. El tiempo total de interrupciones es 40 minutos por cada 100 minutos de descarga real, lo que equivale a 40 minutos por cada 100 minutos de tiempo total.

mgsm-es-10,"Question in English: A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times more than the downloads in the first month, but then it decreased by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have in total during the three months?

Primero, calculamos el número de descargas en el segundo mes. Dado que las descargas en el segundo mes fueron tres veces más que en el primer mes, multiplicamos 60 por 3:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

Entonces, las descargas en el segundo mes fueron 180.

A continuación, calculamos el número de descargas en el tercer mes. Dado que las descargas se redujeron en un 30%, multiplicamos 180 por 0.7 (que es lo mismo que restar un 30%):

\[ 180 \times 0.7 = 126 \]

Entonces, las descargas en el tercer mes fueron 126.

Finalmente, sumamos las descargas de los tres meses para obtener el total:

mgsm-es-12,"Question in English: Carlos plants a lemon tree. Planting the tree will cost him $90. Each year, it will produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. Watering and feeding the tree costs $3 per year. How many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit with the lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to calculate the total costs and the total revenue over time.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Costs**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
3. **Annual Revenue**: The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Let's denote the number of years by \(n\). The total cost after \(n\) years is the initial cost plus the annual costs for \(n\) years, which is \(90 + 3n\). The total revenue after \(n\) years is the annual revenue multiplied by \(n\), which is \(10.5n\).

Carlos will start making a profit when the total revenue exceeds the total cost. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:
\[10.5n > 90 + 3n\]

Subtract \(3n\) from both sides:
\[7.5n > 90\]

Divide both sides by 7.5:
\[n > \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take \(n = 13\) years for Carlos to start making a profit.

The answer is \(\boxed{13}\).",13,13

Primero, vamos a definir la cantidad inicial de aspiradoras que Melanie tenía como \( x \).

1. Melanie vendió un tercio de sus aspiradoras en la casa verde:
   \[
   \text{Aspiradoras vendidas en la casa verde} = \frac{x}{3}

   Por lo tanto, le quedan:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. Vendió la mitad de lo que le quedaba en la casa naranja:
   \[
   \text{Aspiradoras vendidas en la casa naranja} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)

   \]

4. Sabemos que le quedan 5 aspiradoras:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5

5. Resolvamos la ecuación:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5

mgsm-es-15,"Translation: A merchant wants to choose between two purchase plans: jewels worth $5000 or electronic devices worth $8000. His financial advisor speculates that the market for jewels will rise by 2.5% while the market for electronic devices will rise by 1.2% in the same month. If the merchant wants to choose an option that allows for the maximum profit increase at the end of this month, how much would this profit be?

To determine which option will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit increase for both options.

First, let's calculate the profit increase for the jewels:
The value of the jewels is $5000 and the market is expected to rise by 2.5%. The profit increase for the jewels is:
\[ 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \]
So, the profit increase for the jewels is $125.

Next, let's calculate the profit increase for the electronic devices:
The value of the electronic devices is $8000 and the market is expected to rise by 1.2%. The profit increase for the electronic devices is:
\[ 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \]
So, the profit increase for the electronic devices is $96.

Comparing the two profit increases, we see that the profit increase for the jewels ($125) is greater than the profit increase for the electronic devices ($96).

Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewels to maximize the profit increase, and the profit increase would be:
\[ \boxed{125} \]",125,125

To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and being a cheerleading coach, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks per year.
- She is paid $20 per hour for teaching.

The total hours she works as a teacher in a year is:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 1750 \text{ hours/year} \]

Her earnings from teaching are:
\[ 1750 \text{ hours/year} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 35000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- Jill works 15 hours per week as a cheerleading coach.
- She works 50 weeks per year.
- She is paid $30 per hour for being a cheerleading coach.

The total hours she works as a cheerleading coach in a year is:

Her earnings from being a cheerleading coach are:
\[ 750 \text{ hours/year} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 22500 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, we sum her earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \text{ dollars/year} + 22500 \text{ dollars/year} = 57500 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is \(\boxed{57500}\).",57500,57500

Para resolver esto, primero calculamos cuánto tiempo en total Marissa tiene para completar su sendero para alcanzar una velocidad promedio de 4 millas por hora. La fórmula para la velocidad promedio es:

\[
\text{Velocidad promedio} = \frac{\text{Distancia total}}{\text{Tiempo total}}
\]

Dado que la velocidad promedio deseada es 4 millas por hora y la distancia total es 12 millas, podemos resolver para el tiempo total:

However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high-heeled shoes that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33 and the other costs double, how much do the boots cost?

To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know the following:
1. The cost of one pair of high-heeled shoes is $33.
2. The cost of the other pair of high-heeled shoes is double that of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

Gunter is trying to count the pieces of gum he has in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One friend says 80. Another friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. A third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess. What is their average guess?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Identify the guesses from each friend:
   - The first friend's guess is 80.
   - The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
     \[
     \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]
   - The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:
     \[
     \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
     \]

2. Calculate the average of the three guesses:
   - Add the three guesses together:
     \[
     80 + 60 + 100 = 240
     \]
   - Divide the sum by 3 to find the average:
     \[
     \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
     \]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
mgsm-es-32,"Translation: John cares for 10 dogs. Each dog takes him 30 minutes a day to walk and take care of their needs. How many hours does he dedicate to taking care of the dogs per week?

Respuesta: Para resolver esto, primero calculamos cuántas horas al día John dedica a cuidar de los perros. Como cada perro le toma 30 minutos, y hay 10 perros, la cantidad total de tiempo al día es:

\[ 10 \text{ perros} \times 30 \text{ minutos} = 300 \text{ minutos} \]

Convertimos los minutos a horas:

\[ 300 \text{ minutos} \div 60 = 5 \text{ horas} \]

Esto significa que John dedica 5 horas al día a cuidar de los perros. Ahora, para encontrar cuántas horas dedica a la semana, multiplicamos las horas diarias por los días de la semana:

\[ 5 \text{ horas/día} \times 7 \text{ días/semana} = 35 \text{ horas/semana} \]

Por lo tanto, John dedica $\boxed{35}$ horas a la semana al cuidado de los perros.",35,35
mgsm-es-33,"Question in English: Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

Primero, definamos las variables:
- Sea \( G \) el número de monedas de oro.
- Sea \( S \) el número de monedas de plata.

Según el problema, sabemos que:
1. \( G + S = 110 \) (el total de monedas es 110)
2. \( G = S + 30 \) (hay 30 monedas de oro más que de plata)

Podemos sustituir la segunda ecuación en la primera:
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]

Simplificamos y resolvemos para \( S \):
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Ahora que sabemos que \( S = 40 \), podemos encontrar \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Por lo tanto, Gretchen tiene \(\boxed{70}\) monedas de oro.",70,70

mgsm-es-36,"Translation: Terry compra 2 yogures por día. Actualmente hay una oferta de 4 yogures por $5. ¿Cuánto gasta en yogur durante 30 días?

Respuesta: Primero, calculamos cuántos yogures compra Terry en 30 días. Como compra 2 yogures por día, en 30 días compraría \(2 \times 30 = 60\) yogures.

Dado que la oferta es de 4 yogures por $5, podemos determinar cuántas ofertas de 4 yogures puede obtener con 60 yogures. Esto se calcula dividiendo 60 por 4, que da \(60 \div 4 = 15\). Esto significa que Terry puede obtener 15 ofertas de 4 yogures cada una por $5.

mgsm-es-37,"Question in English: John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 Lego games that he sells for $15 each. In the end, he buys 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many Lego games does he have left?

Primero, calculamos el dinero que John obtiene al vender sus juegos de Lego:
\[ 13 \text{ juegos} \times \$15 \text{ por juego} = \$195 \]

Luego, calculamos el costo total de los videojuegos que compra:
\[ 8 \text{ videojuegos} \times \$20 \text{ por videojuego} = \$160 \]

Después, restamos el costo de los videojuegos del dinero que obtuvo al vender los juegos de Lego para ver cuánto dinero le sobró:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Según el problema, John tiene $5 de sobrante, por lo que el cálculo anterior tiene un error. Vamos a reevaluar el problema con la información correcta.

Si John tiene $5 de sobrante, entonces el dinero que gastó en los videojuegos es:
\[ \$195 - \$5 = \$190 \]

Ahora, calculamos cuántos juegos de Lego vendió para obtener $190:
\[ \frac{\$190}{\$15 \text{ por juego}} = \frac{190}{15} = \frac{38}{3} \approx 12.67 \]

Como John no puede vender una fracción de un juego, significa que vendió 12 juegos de Lego y le sobró $10 (ya que $12 \times 15 = 180$ y $190 - 180 = 10$). Con $10 de sobrante, no puede comprar más videojuegos, por lo que no cambia el número de juegos de Lego que tiene.

Por lo tanto, el número de juegos de Lego que John tiene todavía es:
\[ 13 - 12 = 1 \]

La respuesta es:

mgsm-es-38,"Translation: John runs 60 miles per week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and that distance is half of what he runs on the other two days. What is his speed?

Primero, determinemos la distancia que John corre en los otros dos días. Sabemos que la distancia total que corre en una semana es 60 millas, y que el primer día corre la mitad de la distancia que corre en los otros dos días juntos. Si llamamos \( x \) a la distancia que corre en cada uno de los otros dos días, entonces la distancia que corre en el primer día es \( \frac{x}{2} \). La ecuación para la distancia total es:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + x + x = 60
\]

Simplificando la ecuación, obtenemos:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2x = 60
\]

\[
\frac{x + 4x}{2} = 60
\]

\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 60
\]

Multiplicando ambos lados por 2, obtenemos:

\[
5x = 120
\]

Dividiendo ambos lados por 5, obtenemos:

\[
x = 24
\]

Por lo tanto, John corre 24 millas cada uno de los otros dos días. La distancia que corre en el primer día es:

\[
\frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ millas}
\]

Ahora, sabemos que John corre 12 millas en 3 horas. Para encontrar su velocidad, usamos la fórmula de velocidad:

\[
\text{Velocidad} = \frac{\text{Distancia}}{\text{Tiempo}} = \frac{12 \text{ millas}}{3 \text{ horas}} = 4 \text{ millas por hora}

Por lo tanto, la velocidad a la que John corre es \(\boxed{4}\) millas por hora.",4,10
mgsm-es-39,"First, let's translate the question into English:

Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can jump at a speed that is half of her running speed. If she can jump at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she cover in six hours if she runs one-third of the time and walks two-thirds of the time?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine Dana's running speed.
   Since Dana can jump at 3 miles per hour and this is half of her running speed, her running speed is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. Determine Dana's walking speed.
   Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. Calculate the time spent running and walking.
   Dana runs for one-third of the time and walks for two-thirds of the time in six hours. So, the time spent running is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   and the time spent walking is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Calculate the distance covered by running and walking.
   The distance covered by running is:
   \[
   6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]
   The distance covered by walking is:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}

Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only known weapon that could kill the dragon, up to 400 feet, well within the dragon's reach. But when Polly had the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when she didn't have it. How far away from the dragon's flames could Polly stand to be able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin when she had the sapphire gemstone?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when she has the sapphire gemstone.
   - When Polly has the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when she doesn't have it.
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) feet.

2. Determine how far away Polly can stand from the dragon's flames to be able to hit the dragon.
   - The dragon can spew fire up to 1000 feet.
   - Polly can throw the javelin up to 1200 feet.
   - To be able to hit the dragon, Polly must stand at a distance that is less than 1200 feet but more than 1000 feet from the dragon.
   - The maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon's flames to still be able to hit it is 1199 feet (since 1200 feet would be out of the dragon's reach).

She cut each pie into 8 slices and placed the five pies on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. At the end of the night, after the guests served themselves and ate the pie slices, there were 14 slices left. How many slices were served to the guests?

To determine how many slices of pie were served to the guests, we start by calculating the total number of slices available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ slices per pie} = 40 \text{ slices} \]

At the end of the night, there were 14 slices left. To find out how many slices were served, we subtract the number of slices left from the total number of slices:

\[ 40 \text{ slices} - 14 \text{ slices left} = 26 \text{ slices served} \]

Thus, the number of slices served to the guests is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26

To determine how many grams of French fries can be eaten, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories available for the day.
2. Determine how many more calories can be consumed.
3. Calculate how many servings of French fries can be eaten with the remaining calories.
4. Convert the number of servings into grams.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories available for the day.
The daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and 1800 calories have already been consumed.
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Determine how many servings of French fries can be eaten with the remaining calories.
Each serving of French fries contains 250 calories.
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Step 3: Convert the number of servings into grams.
Since 5 servings are 300 grams, 1 serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams/serving} \]
Therefore, 0.8 servings is:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the number of grams of French fries that can be eaten is \(\boxed{48}\).",48,48
mgsm-es-44,"Translation: Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 conical candles. A pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies. If he sells each candle for $2.00, what will be his net profit after making and selling 20 candles?

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the supplies needed to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, we calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 and Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, the cost to make 20 candles is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \left(\frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}}\right) \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Net profit} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours Meredith dedicated to the articles over the three days.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then calculate the total time spent writing those articles.

1. **Determine the number of articles written each day:**
   - **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles written on Tuesday is:
     \[
     5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7

mgsm-es-46,"Question in English: Candice put 80 stickers in her purse before going to work at the cafeteria. On the way, she stopped at the store and bought a package of stickers. At work, she placed one sticker on each of the 220 different coffee mugs. If she has 23 stickers left in total, how many stickers were in the package she bought?

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stickers were in the package Candice bought. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers**: Candice started with 80 stickers.
2. **Stickers Used at Work**: She used 220 stickers to decorate the coffee mugs.
3. **Stickers Left**: After using the stickers, she has 23 stickers left.

We can set up the equation to find out how many stickers were in the package she bought. Let \( x \) be the number of stickers in the package. The total number of stickers she had initially plus the stickers in the package minus the stickers used should equal the number of stickers left.

The equation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags of wheat the merchant sold. Let's denote the number of bags by \( x \).

First, we calculate the total cost of buying the wheat:
\[ \text{Cost of wheat} = 20x \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of transporting the wheat:
\[ \text{Cost of transportation} = 2x \]

The total cost for the merchant is the sum of the cost of the wheat and the cost of transportation:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x \]

The merchant sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling the wheat is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 30x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 30x - 22x = 8x \]

We know that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of bags the merchant sold is \(\boxed{50}\).",50,50

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days of the week and used one more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich. He prepared a large plate of macaroni and cheese for several dinners of the week and used 8 slices of cheese. How many slices of cheese did he use?

To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese usage for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days of the week.
   - Each omelet used 2 slices of cheese (1 more than the 1 slice per sandwich).
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

mgsm-es-205,"Question in English: Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert takes six exams each semester. He allows students to eliminate their lowest score when calculating the average for each semester. If Brinley's scores on the first five exams are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, what score does she need on the sixth exam to have an average of 93?

To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth exam to have an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the lowest score among the first five exams.
2. Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores plus the sixth exam score, which should equal the total sum needed to achieve an average of 93.

First, identify the lowest score among the first five exams:
\[ 71, 86, 89, 92, 100 \]
The lowest score is 71.

Next, we need to find the sum of the remaining four scores and the sixth exam score that will give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores} - \text{Lowest score}}{5} \]
We want the average to be 93, so:
\[ 93 = \frac{86 + 89 + 92 + 100 + x - 71}{5} \]
Simplify the expression inside the numerator:
\[ 93 = \frac{336 + x}{5} \]
Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:
\[ 465 = 336 + x \]
Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 465 - 336 \]
\[ x = 129 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{129}\) on her sixth exam to have an average of 93.",93,98

If Sara already had $10 saved before starting to babysit, how many times will she need to mow the lawn before she can buy the jacket and the shoes?

To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to buy the jacket and the shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of 2 pairs of shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
So, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has already earned and saved. She already had $10 saved, and she earns $5 each time she babysits. Since she babysits 4 times, she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
So, the total amount of money Sara has now is:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times.",10,10

To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red hens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white hens.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Each red hen lays 3 eggs per day.

Jerry has two pools, both with leaks that drain them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the large pool had the same amount of water as the small pool. Now, the large pool has four times the amount of water in the small pool. How much water is in the small pool now?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( L \) be the amount of water in the large pool 4 minutes ago.
2. Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
3. According to the problem, \( L = S \) four minutes ago.
4. The leak rate is 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, each pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.
5. Therefore, the amount of water in the large pool now is \( L - 16 \).
6. The amount of water in the small pool now is \( S - 16 \).
7. According to the problem, the large pool now has four times the amount of water in the small pool, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   L - 16 = 4(S - 16)
   \]
8. Since \( L = S \) four minutes ago, we can substitute \( L \) with \( S \) in the equation:
   \[
   S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
   \]
9. Expanding and simplifying the equation:
   \[
   S - 16 = 4S - 64
   \]
   \[
   S - 4S = -64 + 16
   \]
   \[
   -3S = -48

   \[
   S = 16

To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( W \) be the number of games won.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won using the second equation:

polymath-low-es-87,"Translation: A company pays each of its employees $600 per month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of its employees by 10% of the initial salary each year for those who have been in the company for five years. If Sylvie just completed 5 years of service in December last year, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?

To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sylvie's monthly salary after five years.
2. Calculate her annual salary after five years.
3. Calculate her monthly salary after eight years (five years plus three more years).
4. Calculate her annual salary after eight years.

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's monthly salary after five years.**

Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After five years, her salary is increased by 10% each year. The formula to calculate the salary after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Salary after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Salary} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^n \]

For Sylvie:
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 = 600 \times 1.1^5 \]

Calculating \( 1.1^5 \):
\[ 1.1^5 \approx 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times 1.61051 \approx 966.31 \]

So, Sylvie's monthly salary after five years is approximately $966.31.

**Step 2: Calculate her annual salary after five years.**

\[ \text{Annual salary after 5 years} = 966.31 \times 12 \approx 11,595.72 \]

**Step 3: Calculate her monthly salary after eight years.**

After five years, her salary increases by 10% each year for the next three years. So, we need to calculate the salary after an additional 3 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 966.31 \times (1 + 0.10)^3 = 966.31 \times 1.1^3 \]

Calculating \( 1.1^3 \):
\[ 1.1^3 \approx 1.331 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 966.31 \times 1.331 \approx 1286.69 \]

So, Sylvie's monthly salary after eight years is approximately $1286.69.

**Step 4: Calculate her annual salary after eight years.**

\[ \text{Annual salary after 8 years} = 1286.69 \times 12 \approx 15,440.28 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{15440.28}\).",28,9360

He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad and a child will eat half that amount. If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he wants it to be enough for everyone?

Para resolver este problema, primero calculamos cuánta ensalada de papa comerán los adultos y luego los niños.

1. Cálculo para los adultos:
   - Cada adulto come 10 libras de ensalada de papa.
   - Hay 20 adultos.
   - Total para adultos = 10 libras/adulto * 20 adultos = 200 libras.

2. Cálculo para los niños:
   - Cada niño come la mitad de lo que come un adulto, es decir, 5 libras.
   - Hay 5 niños.
   - Total para niños = 5 libras/nino * 5 ninos = 25 libras.

3. Suma total de la cantidad de ensalada de papa necesaria:

""Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. If Cindy has four pets, how many pets do the three of them have in total?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine the number of pets Cindy has:
   \[
   \text{Cindy has 4 pets.}
   \]

2. Determine the number of pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy:
   \[
   \text{Marcia has } 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets.}
   \]

3. Determine the number of pets Jan has. Since Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia:
   \[
   \text{Jan has } 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets.}
   \]

4. Calculate the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together:
   \[

To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the ages of each child based on the given information.

1. Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
   - Amy's age: \( A \)
   - Jackson's age: \( J \)
   - Corey's age: \( C \)
   - James's age: \( 10 \) (given)

2. From the problem, we know:
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( C = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. Using the information that Corey is 11 years old, we can find Amy's age:
   \[
   A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. Now that we know Amy's age, we can find Jackson's age:
   \[
   A = J + 5 \implies 9 = J + 5 \implies J = 9 - 5 = 4

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of each type of animal and then find the total number of domestic animals in the neighborhood.

1. Identify the number of dogs:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. Determine the number of cats. Since there are two cats for each dog:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls in the fifth-grade class.
2. Calculate the number of girls who are in the Girl Scouts group.
3. Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts group from the total number of girls to find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts group.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls.
The total number of students is 200. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]
Therefore, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

Step 2: Calculate the number of girls who are in the Girl Scouts group.
Since 2/3 of the girls belong to the Girl Scouts group, the number of girls in the Girl Scouts group is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Step 3: Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scouts group from the total number of girls to find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts group.
The number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts group is:

On Wednesday, he watched some 30-minute episodes of a show. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one 1-hour episode and a 30-minute program. On Friday, he stayed up late for the weekend and watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched a total of 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total time Frankie watched TV on Monday and Tuesday:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour/episode} \times 2 \text{ episodes} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time Frankie watched TV on Thursday:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the total time Frankie watched TV on Friday:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ episodes} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. The total time he watched TV on Wednesday is:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hour/episode} \times x = 0.5x \text{ hours}
   \]

5. The total time Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday is 7 hours. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} + 0.5x \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} + 0.5x \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.5x = 7 - 8

   \[
   0.5x = -1
   \]
   \[
   x = -1 \div 0.5

0.5x = 7 - 8
\]
\[
0.5x = -1

When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he wanted. When he puts them to cool, he discards 5 of the cookies and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

1. According to the problem, Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he wants to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
2. However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he wanted, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
3. After baking, he discards 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
4. We know that after discarding 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100

   Divide both sides by 2:

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruit rolls each person ate:

- Beatrice ate \(2 \times 24 = 48\) rolls.
- Marcel ate \(3 \times 14 = 42\) rolls.

Next, we find the total number of rolls eaten by both:

\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine the rate at which water enters the boat:
   - Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
   - The rate of rowing is \( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \).
   - The rate of water entering the boat is 2 liters for every 10 feet, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \).

2. Calculate the time it takes to reach the shore:
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the time to row 64 seconds is equivalent to \( \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \).

3. Determine the amount of water that entered the boat:
   - The boat takes on 1 liter of water for every 5 feet rowed.
   - In 80 feet, the amount of water that entered the boat is \( \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{5 \text{ feet/liter}} = 16 \text{ liters} \).

Therefore, the amount of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters.",16,16

polymath-low-es-114,"Question in English: Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. The maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks in the photo that Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, how many ducks can be seen in the photo that Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many photos Brittany's phone can store.
2. Use the information about Brittany's phone to find out how many ducks are in the photo Jamal took.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos and that this is 6 times the number of photos Brittany's phone can store. So, we can calculate the number of photos Brittany's phone can store as follows:
\[
\text{Number of photos Brittany's phone can store} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
\]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks in the photo Jamal took. Therefore, we can find the number of ducks in the photo by dividing the number of photos Brittany's phone can store by 50:
\[
\text{Number of ducks in the photo} = \frac{300}{50} = 6
\]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in the photo that Jamal took of the ducks at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,6

Since he has some leftover, he decides to sell them. He has ten 2 x 4 x 10 inch boards that cost him $10 each, and five 4 x 4 x 10 inch boards that he bought for $16 each. How much does he earn if he sells all of them?

Primero, calculemos el precio actual de cada tipo de tabla. Como los precios subieron un 50%, el nuevo precio de cada tabla será el precio original multiplicado por 1.5.

El nuevo precio de cada tabla de 2 x 4 x 10 es:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dólares} \]

El nuevo precio de cada tabla de 4 x 4 x 10 es:
\[ 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dólares} \]

Ahora, calculemos el ingreso total si Sasha vende todas las tablas. El ingreso de las diez tablas de 2 x 4 x 10 es:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dólares} \]

El ingreso de las cinco tablas de 4 x 4 x 10 es:
\[ 5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dólares} \]

Primero, determinemos cuántas horas durmió Sadie en los dos días siguientes a la lunes. Dado que durmió 2 horas menos cada día, podemos calcular:

\[
8 - 2 = 6 \text{ horas por cada día}
\]

Por lo tanto, para los dos días, durmió:

\[
6 \text{ horas/día} \times 2 \text{ días} = 12 \text{ horas}

She puts stamps on one-third of the letters that need stamps. If now there are 30 letters in the pile of letters that already have stamps, how many were there in that pile when Jennie started?

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many letters Jennie started with in the pile that already had stamps.

1. Jennie starts with 60 letters that need stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We know Jessa's age: Jessa = 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so we calculate Joan's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Joan} = \text{Jessa} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who left through exit A.
2. Determine the number of students remaining after some left through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who left through exit B.
4. Determine the number of students who left through exit C.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who left through exit A.**

The total number of students is 1000. Thirty percent of these students left through exit A.

To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is:

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume compared to her sister?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day:
   - On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
   - On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.

2. Calculate how many cookies Sue ate on each day:
   - On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

3. Calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
   - Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.
   - Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

4. Calculate the total number of calories each of them consumed:
   - Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
   - Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

5. Determine how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister:
   - The difference in calories is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\).

To determine the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the initial cost of the house and the cost of repairs from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The initial value of the house is $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is the original value plus 150% of the original value.

The increase in value is:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost of the house and the cost of repairs from the new value:
\[ 200,000 - 80,000 - 50,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed that contains seeds, larvae, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. She feeds the chickens in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of food. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of food. How many cups of food does she need to give to her chickens in the last meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Determine the total amount of food needed per day for 20 chickens.
2. Calculate the amount of food already given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount of food already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the last meal.

First, calculate the total daily requirement for 20 chickens:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, calculate the amount of food already given:
\[ 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, subtract the amount of food already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much is needed for the last meal:

How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?

Primero, calculemos la distancia que John recorre al ir hacia el lugar donde se dio cuenta de que se olvidó algo:

\[ \text{Distancia} = \text{Tiempo} \times \text{Velocidad} = 3 \, \text{horas} \times 60 \, \text{mph} = 180 \, \text{millas} \]

Watering and fertilizing the tree costs $3 per year. How many years will it take for Carlos to start making a profit with the lemon tree?

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit with the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total costs and the total revenue over time and find the point where the revenue exceeds the costs.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Costs**: The cost to water and fertilize the tree each year is $3.
3. **Annual Revenue**: The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Let's denote the number of years by \(n\). The total cost after \(n\) years is the initial cost plus the annual costs for \(n\) years:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90 + 3n \]

The total revenue after \(n\) years is the annual revenue for \(n\) years:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10.5n \]

To find the point where Carlos starts making a profit, we need to find the smallest \(n\) such that the total revenue is greater than the total cost:
\[ 10.5n > 90 + 3n \]

Subtract \(3n\) from both sides:
\[ 7.5n > 90 \]

Divide both sides by 7.5:
\[ n > \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, \(n = 13\).

So, it will take Carlos 13 years to start making a profit with the lemon tree. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}

1. Sea \( x \) el número total de aspiradoras que Melanie tenía al comienzo.

2. Vendió \(\frac{1}{3}x\) aspiradoras en la casa verde.
3. Vendió 2 más en la casa roja, por lo que el total vendido en la casa roja es \(\frac{1}{3}x + 2\).
4. Después de las ventas en las casas verde y roja, le quedaban \( x - \left(\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}x + 2\right) = x - \frac{2}{3}x - 2 = \frac{1}{3}x - 2 \) aspiradoras.
5. Vendió la mitad de lo que le quedaba en la casa naranja, es decir, \(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{3}x - 2\right)\).
6. Después de la venta en la casa naranja, le quedaban 5 aspiradoras.

Podemos establecer la ecuación final para las aspiradoras que le quedan:

\[
\frac{1}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{3}x - 2\right) = 5
\]

Primero simplificamos la ecuación:

\[
\frac{1}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{3}x - 2\right) = 5

\[
\frac{1}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{6}x + 1 = 5

To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and being a cheerleading coach, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She is paid $20 per hour for teaching.

The total hours she works as a teacher in a year is:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 1750 \text{ hours/year} \]

Her earnings from teaching are:
\[ 1750 \text{ hours/year} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$35000 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- Jill works 15 hours per week as a cheerleading coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- She is paid $30 per hour for being a cheerleading coach.

The total hours she works as a cheerleading coach in a year is:

**Answer:**

Primero, calculemos cuánto tiempo en total Marissa necesita para completar el sendero de 12 millas a una velocidad promedio de 4 millas por hora. La fórmula para la velocidad promedio es:

\[
\text{Velocidad promedio} = \frac{\text{Distancia total}}{\text{Tiempo total}}
\]

Dado que la velocidad promedio deseada es 4 millas por hora y la distancia total es 12 millas, podemos encontrar el tiempo total necesario:

\[

Next, we need to account for the 1 liter of orange juice that is spilled. Since the spilled juice is also two-thirds water, the amount of water spilled is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \text{ liters}
  \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange juice after the spill:
  \[
  \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ liters}
  \]

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture (14 liters of orange juice and 15 liters of pineapple juice) is:
  \[
  6 \text{ liters (from orange juice)} + 9 \text{ liters (from pineapple juice)} = 15 \text{ liters}

Therefore, the amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture is:

polymath-low-es-24,"Question in English: Kyle bought the best-selling book of last year for $19.50. This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?

To find the original price of the book, we need to determine what the price would be before the 25% discount was applied. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that the price Kyle paid is $19.50, which is 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount), we can set up the following equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26

To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many boxes of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ portions} \]

Step 2: Determine how many boxes of ice cream she will need to buy.
Each box contains 15 portions of ice cream. To find out how many boxes she needs, we divide the total number of portions by the number of portions per box:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ portions}}{15 \text{ portions/box}} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.
Each box costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 boxes is:

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.
2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Identify the guesses from each friend:
   - The first friend's guess is 80.
   - The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60

Para resolver este problema, primero definamos las variables:
- Sea \( R \) el número de abejas reinas.
- Entonces, el número de abejas bebés será \( 2R \) (dos veces el número de abejas reinas).
- El número de abejas obreras será \( 2 \times 2R = 4R \) (dos veces el número de abejas bebés).

La suma de todas las abejas es igual al número total de abejas en la colmena, que es 700. Por lo tanto, podemos escribir la ecuación:

She calculates that her total income will be $92 per week. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so what profit will Kim make each week, in dollars?

Now, let's answer the question in Spanish and enclose the final number in $\boxed{}$.

Primero, calculamos los gastos totales por semana. Kim tiene 3 clientes actuales y 5 clientes potenciales, lo que significa que tendrá un total de 8 clientes. Para cada cliente, necesita 2 botellas de lejía y un paquete de paños de limpieza. El costo de las botellas de lejía es $2 cada una y el costo de los paquetes de paños de limpieza es $5 cada uno.

El costo total de las botellas de lejía por cliente es:
\[2 \text{ botellas} \times \$2 \text{ por botella} = \$4\]

El costo total de los paquetes de paños de limpieza por cliente es:
\[1 \text{ paquete} \times \$5 \text{ por paquete} = \$5\]

El costo total por cliente es:
\[\$4 + \$5 = \$9\]

Como Kim tendrá 8 clientes, el costo total por semana es:
\[8 \text{ clientes} \times \$9 \text{ por cliente} = \$72\]

Kim calcula que sus ingresos totales serán de $92 por semana. La ganancia es la diferencia entre los ingresos totales y los gastos totales:

""Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill lines up all the baked goods in a row, what is the total length in feet?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total length of the rolls in inches:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

2. Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants in inches:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

3. Calculate the total length of the baguettes in inches:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]
(Note that 2 feet = 24 inches, so each baguette is 24 inches long.)

4. Add the lengths together to get the total length in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

5. Convert the total length from inches to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length in feet is:

Blake and Kelly are competing to see who can run more in 15 minutes. They decide to have the competition on the football field, which is 100 yards long. Blake runs from one end to the other 15 times. Kelly runs from one end to the other once and then decides she doesn't want to run alongside Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther did the winner run compared to the loser?

**Answer:**

Primero, calculamos la distancia que corrió Blake:
- Blake corre de un lado a otro 15 veces.
- Cada ida y vuelta es 200 yardas (100 yardas de ida + 100 yardas de vuelta).
- Por lo tanto, Blake corre \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yardas.

A continuación, calculamos la distancia que corrió Kelly:
- Kelly corre de un lado a otro una vez.
- Cada ida y vuelta es 200 yardas.
- Después, Kelly corre a la línea de 40 yardas y vuelve 34 veces.
- Cada ida y vuelta hasta la línea de 40 yardas y de vuelta es \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) yardas (40 yardas de ida + 40 yardas de vuelta).
- Por lo tanto, Kelly corre \( 1 \times 200 + 34 \times 160 = 200 + 5440 = 5640 \) yardas.

Comparando las distancias:
- Kelly corrió 5640 yardas.
- Blake corrió 3000 yardas.

Para encontrar cuánto más lejos corrió Kelly, restamos la distancia de Blake de la distancia de Kelly:
\[ 5640 - 3000 = 2640 \]

Por lo tanto, el ganador (Kelly) corrió \(\boxed{2640}\) yardas más que el perdedor (Blake).",2640,80

Now, let's answer the question step by step.

1. Determine how many starfish Locsin caught:
   Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.

2. Determine how many sea anemones Locsin caught:
   Anakin caught 6 sea anemones, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea anemones.

3. Determine how many clownfish Locsin caught:
   Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

4. Calculate the total number of starfish caught by both:
   Anakin caught 10 starfish and Locsin caught 5 starfish, so together they caught \(10 + 5 = 15\) starfish.

5. Calculate the total number of sea anemones caught by both:
   Anakin caught 6 sea anemones and Locsin caught 3 sea anemones, so together they caught \(6 + 3 = 9\) sea anemones.

6. Calculate the total number of clownfish caught by both:
   Anakin caught 3 clownfish and Locsin caught 5 clownfish, so together they caught \(3 + 5 = 8\) clownfish.

mgsm-es-162,"Translation: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?

Para resolver este problema, primero necesitamos entender cómo se incrementa el precio cada dos meses. El precio aumenta un 20% cada dos meses, lo que significa que cada dos meses el precio se multiplica por 1.20 (100% + 20%).

Dado que 36 meses equivalen a 18 períodos de dos meses, podemos calcular el precio después de 36 meses utilizando la fórmula de crecimiento exponencial:

\[ \text{Precio final} = \text{Precio inicial} \times (1 + \text{tasa de crecimiento})^{\text{número de períodos}} \]

En este caso, el precio inicial es $20, la tasa de crecimiento es 20% (o 0.20), y el número de períodos es 18. Sustituyendo estos valores en la fórmula, obtenemos:

\[ \text{Precio final} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Ahora, calculamos \((1.20)^{18}\):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.824 \]

Entonces, el precio final es:

\[ \text{Precio final} = 20 \times 10.824 = 216.48 \]

Por lo tanto, el precio de una bolsa de marbles después de 36 meses sería \(\boxed{216.48}\).",48,92

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Identify the cost of each type of toy:
   - A red car costs $4.
   - A collectible doll costs $5.
   - The doll costs the same as 3 collectible dolls plus one red car. Since a collectible doll costs $5, 3 collectible dolls cost $5 * 3 = $15. Adding the cost of one red car, the doll costs $15 + $4 = $19.

2. Calculate the total cost of all the toys:
   - The cost of 5 red cars is $4 * 5 = $20.
   - The cost of 3 collectible dolls is $5 * 3 = $15.
   - The cost of 1 doll is $19.
   - Therefore, the total cost of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $19 = $54.

mgsm-es-180,"Question in English: Two candidates run for class representative at Sarai's school. If the winner received 3/4 of the votes and the total number of students who voted was 80, calculate the number of votes the loser received.

To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many votes the winner received. Since the winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes, we can calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Next, we need to find out how many votes the loser received. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser received is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
mgsm-es-181,"Question in English: Sandra, the corner florist, is very unhappy with the incomplete order from Fred. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink lilies, which were five times the amount of white carnations. Sandra threatened to switch suppliers if she did not receive the missing red roses by 5 p.m. How many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 p.m. to keep Sandra's business?

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white carnations Sandra ordered and then use that information to find out how many red roses she ordered.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of white carnations Sandra ordered.
2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink lilies, which were five times the amount of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   5x = 200
   \]
3. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.
4. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses Sandra ordered is:
   \[
   4x = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]
5. Since Sandra is missing some red roses, Fred needs to deliver the missing 160 red roses by 5 p.m. to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}

mgsm-es-182,"First, let's translate the question into English:

""Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. If Jan is 30 years old, how old is Jean?""

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Let's denote Mark's current age by \( M \) and Jean's current age by \( J \).
3. According to the problem, Jean is two years older than Mark, so we have:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
4. Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \). Half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \). Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \). The problem states that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age at that time, so we have:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   M - 2 = 19 \implies M = 21
   \]
6. Now that we know Mark's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:
   \[
   J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old.",23,23
mgsm-es-183,"Question in English: Two field and track teams compete against each other in a 4x400 meters relay race; a race in which each competing team is made up of four members and each one runs 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track. One of the two teams is well-formed and each of its members will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less well-formed; the first runner will run their 400 meters in 60 seconds, then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Given this information, by how many seconds will the faster team win?

Para resolver este problema, primero calculamos el tiempo total que tomará cada equipo terminar la carrera.

**Equipo bien formado:**
Cada uno de los cuatro corredores correrá 400 metros en 55 segundos.
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ segundos}
\]

**Equipo menos formado:**
El primer corredor correrá 400 metros en 60 segundos.
El segundo corredor será 3 segundos más rápido que el primero, por lo que correrá en 57 segundos.
El tercer corredor será 3 segundos más rápido que el segundo, por lo que correrá en 54 segundos.
El cuarto corredor será 3 segundos más rápido que el tercer corredor, por lo que correrá en 51 segundos.
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ segundos}
\]

Ahora, calculamos la diferencia en tiempo entre los dos equipos:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ segundos}

Jerry throws a six-sided die. How much more likely (expressed as a percentage) is it that he will roll a number greater than 3 than that he will roll two even numbers in a row?

### Answer in Spanish:
Para resolver este problema, primero debemos calcular la probabilidad de cada evento y luego determinar cuánto más probable es uno que el otro.

1. **Probabilidad de sacar un número mayor que 3:**
   - Los números mayores que 3 en un dado de seis caras son 4, 5, y 6.
   - Hay 3 números favorables.
   - La probabilidad es \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\).

2. **Probabilidad de sacar dos números pares seguidos:**
   - Los números pares en un dado de seis caras son 2, 4, y 6.
   - Hay 3 números pares.
   - La probabilidad de sacar un número par en una tirada es \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\).
   - La probabilidad de sacar un número par en la segunda tirada es también \(\frac{1}{2}\).
   - La probabilidad de que ambos eventos ocurran es \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}\).

3. **Diferencia en probabilidad:**
   - La probabilidad de sacar un número mayor que 3 es \(\frac{1}{2}\).
   - La probabilidad de sacar dos números pares seguidos es \(\frac{1}{4}\).
   - La diferencia en probabilidad es \(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}\).

4. **Convertir la diferencia en probabilidad a porcentaje:**
   - \(\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\).
   - \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\%\).

Por lo tanto, es \(\boxed{25}\)% más probable que Jerry saque un número mayor que 3 que que saque dos números pares seguidos.",3,25

mgsm-es-186,"Question in English: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing hay among the rodents. The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat receives 6 pieces of hay. There are 10 hamster cages that are separated, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of hay. There is also a rabbit pen where 20 pieces of hay are distributed among the rabbits. No hay is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of hay have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many rats are in each cage. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of hay given to the hamsters:**
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of hay.
   - There are 10 hamster cages.
   - Total hay for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces of hay.

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of hay given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of hay for the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of hay given to the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of hay distributed among the small rodents is 160.
   - Subtract the hay given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total.
   - Total hay for rats = \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces of hay.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of hay.
   - Number of rats = \(\frac{90}{6} = 15\) rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages for the rats.
   - Number of rats per cage = \(\frac{15}{3} = 5\) rats.

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed on a monthly interest rate of 2%. If Mandy can pay it back after 3 months, how much should she give Benedict?

**Answer:**
Primero, calculamos el interés acumulado después de 3 meses. El interés mensual es del 2%, por lo que cada mes Mandy acumula un interés de $100 \times 0.02 = $2.

Después de 1 mes, el interés acumulado sería $2. Después de 2 meses, el interés acumulado sería $2 + $2 = $4. Después de 3 meses, el interés acumulado sería $4 + $2 = $6.

Por lo tanto, el total que Mandy debe pagar a Benedict después de 3 meses es la cantidad original más el interés acumulado, que es $100 + $6 = $106.

Finalmente, la cantidad que Mandy debe dar a Benedict es \(\boxed{106}\).",106,106
