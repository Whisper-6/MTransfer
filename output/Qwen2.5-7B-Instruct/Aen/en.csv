mgsm-en-47,"First, we determine the number of blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we find the number of red ties John bought. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we have:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we find the total amount spent on ties by adding the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.**

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per week.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. Therefore, the total revenue per week is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week.",294,294

mgsm-en-53,"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for both Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the two days.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60.
- The revenue from truck tires on Thursday is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repairs 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Thursday is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40.
- The revenue from car tires on Friday is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, the revenue from truck tires on Friday is $0.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Friday is \(480 + 0 = 480\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- The revenue on Thursday is $520.
- The revenue on Friday is $480.
- The difference in revenue is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday.",40,40

mgsm-en-62,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the two components of her pension: the fixed annual pension and the additional pension based on the value of the pension after 20 years.

1. **Fixed Annual Pension:**
   Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

2. **Additional Pension:**
   The additional pension is 5% of the value of the pension. The value of the pension is the fixed annual pension multiplied by the number of years of service. After 20 years, Marcy has worked for 10 more years, so the value of the pension is:
   \[
   50,000 \times 10 = 500,000

2. **First Half of the Year:**
   There are 6 months in the first half of the year. Therefore, the total cost for the first half is:
   \[
   6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Second Half of the Year:**
   The charge for the second half of the year is 10% less than the initial monthly charge. First, we calculate 10% of $140:
   \[
   0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-en-74,"First, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar.

- Marigolds are sold for $2.74 per pot. Rounding $2.74 to the nearest dollar gives us $3.
- Petunias are sold for $1.87 per pot. Rounding $1.87 to the nearest dollar gives us $2.
- Begonias are sold for $2.12 per pot. Rounding $2.12 to the nearest dollar gives us $2.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each type of flower.

- For marigolds: \(12 \text{ pots} \times \$3 \text{ per pot} = \$36\).
- For petunias: \(9 \text{ pots} \times \$2 \text{ per pot} = \$18\).
- For begonias: \(17 \text{ pots} \times \$2 \text{ per pot} = \$34\).

Now, we sum the revenues from all the flowers to find the total amount Artie will make.

1. **Top level (Level 4):**
   \[
   \text{Level 4} = 16 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Level 3:**
   \[
   \text{Level 3} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Level 4} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Level 2:**
   \[
   \text{Level 2} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Level 3} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Base level (Level 1):**
   \[
   \text{Level 1} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Level 2} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ square feet}

Next, we sum the square footage of all four levels:
\[
\text{Total square footage} = \text{Level 1} + \text{Level 2} + \text{Level 3} + \text{Level 4}
\]
\[
\text{Total square footage} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{\text{Total square footage}}{\text{Number of levels}} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}

2. Use the information about Sarah's laundry to find out how much Raymond does.
3. Calculate the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

First, let's denote the amount of laundry David does as \( D \). According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can write:
\[ 4D = 400 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can write:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

mgsm-en-84,"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we have the equation:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us the equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

mgsm-en-195,"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. We know the cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of one pen is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now that we know the cost of one pen is $1.50, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00

According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we have the equation:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now we substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( r = 4 \). To verify, we calculate the number of white chickens:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Then we check the total number of eggs produced:

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers counted on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of customers counted on the third day. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:

\[ B_0 = 2S_0. \]

Now, let's consider the current situation. Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in the last 4 minutes, each pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water. Therefore, the current amount of water in the big pool is \( B_0 - 16 \) and the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S_0 - 16 \). The problem states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we have:
\[ B_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16). \]

We already know that \( B_0 = 2S_0 \), so we can substitute \( 2S_0 \) for \( B_0 \) in the equation:
\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16). \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 64, \]
\[ 2S_0 - 4S_0 = -64 + 16, \]
\[ -2S_0 = -48, \]
\[ S_0 = 24. \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. Since the small pool has been leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute for the last 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S_0 - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8. \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,8

mgsm-en-218,"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we start by finding their current ages based on the given information.

First, we know Harriet's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = 21 \text{ years} \]

Next, we use the information that Harriet's age is half of Zack's age to find Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Then, we use the information that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age to find Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Now, we calculate their ages in three years:
\[ \text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years} \]
\[ \text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years} \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:

Next, we calculate Yuri's score. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we first find half of Naomi's score:
\[
\frac{68}{2} = 34
\]
Then we add 10 to this value to get Yuri's score:
\[
34 + 10 = 44
\]
So, Yuri scored 44 points.

Now, we calculate Brianna's score. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's score:
\[
68 + 17 = 85
\]
So, Brianna scored 85 points.

Now we know the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. We can find Jojo's score by subtracting the sum of their scores from the total score of 251 points. First, we calculate the sum of the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]
Then we subtract this sum from the total score to find Jojo's score:
\[
251 - 197 = 54

1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

First, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week and he runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   John runs half as much on the other two days. So, the distance he runs on each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2}

3. **Total distance run in the week:**
   Adding the distances from all three days, we get:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + 3v = 6v

\text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

We calculate the distance traveled by running and walking:
\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, we sum the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[
\boxed{18}

polymath-low-en-47,"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]
Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]
The total cost of the blue ties is $200, so the total amount spent on ties is:

Let's denote the square footage of the levels from top to bottom as \(L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4\). We have:
\[ L_1 = 16 \]
\[ L_2 = \frac{L_1}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ L_3 = \frac{L_2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ L_4 = \frac{L_3}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can find the total square footage of all four levels by summing these values:

Next, we determine the distance John covers in the 4 hours he tries to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time. He then drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph:
\[
\text{Distance covered in 0.5 hours at 30 mph} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}

3. **Annual Cost**: The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the annual cost:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-even Point**: To find the number of years it takes to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90. We set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Net profit per year} \times \text{Number of years} = \text{Initial cost}
   \]
   \[
   \$7.5 \times \text{Number of years} = \$90

mgsm-en-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \]
The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \]

We know that after the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners.",18,18

mgsm-en-37,"First, we calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. Therefore, the total amount of money from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games, each costing $20. Therefore, the total amount of money spent on the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means that the amount of money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the total amount of money he had from selling the lego sets. We can verify this by adding the money spent on video games and the money left:
\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total amount of money John had from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $160 on video games and has $5 left, the calculation is consistent. The problem asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all his lego sets, he has:
\[ 0 \text{ lego sets} \]

Thus, the final answer is:

mgsm-en-38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs each day and then find the average speed over the week.

First, let's break down the distance John runs each day:
- On the first day, John runs 3 hours. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is \( 3v \) miles.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.

Next, we calculate the total distance John runs in a week:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v
\]

We know that the total distance John runs in a week is 60 miles:
\[
6v = 60
\]

Solve for \( v \):
\[
v = \frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

Thus, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10
mgsm-en-39,"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours given her different speeds for running, walking, and skipping, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed.
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, we can find her walking speed.
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in six hours.
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time.
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Similarly, we calculate the distance for walking.
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Add the distances traveled while running and walking.
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles}

1. Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day.
2. Determine the total number of articles written over the three days.
3. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing these articles.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

   She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

3. **Remaining Post-it Notes:**
   After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

4. **Post-it Notes in the Package:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of Post-it notes:
\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 80 - 220 + x = -140 + x
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   -140 + x = 23
   \]
   Add 140 to both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 23 + 140

   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

2. Calculate the number of girls in Grade 5.
3. Determine how many of the girls are in the girl scout.
4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

Let's start with step 1. The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Next, for step 2, we calculate the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

For step 3, we need to find out how many of the girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Finally, for step 4, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout:

Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars have passed through, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway is \( 30 - x \). Then, 20 more cars pass through in the next 15 minutes, and 5 cars exit the motorway. Therefore, the number of cars that remain on the motorway after the second 15 minutes is \( (30 - x) - 20 + 5 = 15 - x \).

Since the problem does not provide the final number of cars on the motorway, we can infer that all the cars that were on the motorway initially either passed through or exited. The only way to ensure that the number of cars remaining on the motorway is consistent with the given conditions is to solve for \( x \) such that the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes plus the number that passed through in the second 15 minutes minus the number that exited equals the initial number of cars minus the number that exited.

So, we have:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- He also has a glass of water before bed.
- Therefore, on a weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Wednesday**: \( x \) 30-minute episodes
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- **Friday**: 2 hours

We know the total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. Let's set up the equation to find \( x \):

\[
1 \text{ hour (Monday)} + 1 \text{ hour (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ hours (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Friday)} + 0.5x \text{ hours (Wednesday)} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
1 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Combine the constants:

\[
4.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 4.5 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
0.5x = 2.5
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 5
\]

Thus, Frankie watched \(\boxed{5}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.",30,3
mgsm-en-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, we isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50

mgsm-en-115,"First, we need to determine the original cost of the lumber Sasha bought. The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards was $10 each, and she has ten of them. Therefore, the total original cost for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards was $16 each, and she has five of them. Therefore, the total original cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The total original cost of all the lumber is:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the prices have gone up 50%, the new price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The new price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is:
\[ 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The total selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

mgsm-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. This total can be represented as 20 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the amount of sugar used corresponds to 7 parts, we can find the total amount of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000 and that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time. Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago. Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

Next, we need to find Adrien's current salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it increased by 40% four years later. So, Adrien's current salary is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, her current salary is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

mgsm-en-129,"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors with the patients each day. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent is:
\[ 500 \times 24 \text{ minutes} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
\[ \frac{12000 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to the hospital for the doctors' time. The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost is:
\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the revenue from the patients. The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, and since each patient is seen for 24 minutes (which is 0.4 hours), the charge per patient is:
\[ 200 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars/patient} \]
Therefore, the total revenue from 500 patients is:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 80 \text{ dollars/patient} = 40000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

mgsm-en-133,"To determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Use the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that on Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. Let \( W \) be the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday. The total mileage can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \text{ (Monday)} + 24 \text{ (Tuesday)} + W \text{ (Wednesday)} = 41 \]

We can now solve for \( W \):
\[ 4 + 24 + W = 41 \]
\[ 28 + W = 41 \]
\[ W = 41 - 28 \]
\[ W = 13 \]

Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is \(\boxed{13}\).",13,13

Next, we calculate the cost of the bags of chips. Rory orders 2 bags at $1.50 each:
\[
2 \times 1.50 = 3.00
\]

Then, we calculate the cost of the cookies. Rory orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each:
\[
2 \times 1.00 = 2.00
\]

Now, we add up the costs of the subs, chips, and cookies to find the subtotal:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

Let's start with step 1. The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Next, for step 2, we calculate the number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200 and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120

The total number of cars that originally lined up on the motorway is 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

This total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{5} \).",5,5
polymath-low-en-99,"To determine how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.
2. Determine how many potted plants she will give away.
3. Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has.

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants she currently has:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday to the remaining potted plants:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]",58,58

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is \( \boxed{175} \).",175,175

polymath-low-en-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- He has a glass of water with breakfast.
- He has a glass of water with lunch.
- He has a glass of water with dinner.
- He has a glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ (breakfast)} + 1 \text{ (lunch)} + 1 \text{ (dinner)} + 1 \text{ (before bed)} = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- He has a glass of water with breakfast.
- He has a glass of water with lunch.
- He has a glass of water with dinner (but it's a soda, not water).
- He has a glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ (breakfast)} + 1 \text{ (lunch)} + 0 \text{ (dinner, it's a soda)} + 1 \text{ (before bed)} = 3 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, we sum the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends to get the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ (weekdays)} + 6 \text{ (weekends)} = 26 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26

\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we use this rate to find the time it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[
\text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}

polymath-low-en-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and subtract the known durations of the shows he watched on other days.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Frankie watched on the days we know:
- On Monday, he watched 1 hour.
- On Tuesday, he watched 1 hour.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 0.5 hours (30 minutes).
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the known hours from the total:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we need to find out how many 0.5-hour episodes make up 1.5 hours:

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore:**
   Julia has 64 seconds to reach the shore. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the total distance she needs to row is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:
- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Sasha also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each. The total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- If Sasha sells all ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, and assuming she sells them at the same price as she bought them (since the problem does not specify a different selling price), the total revenue from these boards is:
  \[
  10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}

- If Sasha sells all five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, and assuming she sells them at the same price as she bought them (since the problem does not specify a different selling price), the total revenue from these boards is:
  \[
  5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Since the total revenue from selling the lumber is equal to the total cost of buying the lumber, Sasha's profit is:

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{0}\).",0,90
polymath-low-en-116,"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is therefore \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since the ratio tells us that the total parts are 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]
Since the amount of sugar corresponds to 7 parts, we can find the total amount of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:

polymath-low-en-119,"Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \). According to the problem, Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Therefore, we can express Adrien's salary four years ago as:
\[ A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]
Solving for \( L \), we get:
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]
So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, let's determine Adrien's current salary. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it increased by 40% four years later. Therefore, Adrien's current salary is:
\[ A_{\text{current}} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]
So, Adrien's current salary is $56000.

Next, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary, her current salary is:
\[ L_{\text{current}} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]
So, Lylah's current salary is approximately $43076.92.

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is the sum of their current salaries:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

First, let's identify the number of fruits brought by Morisette:
- Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by Morisette is \(5 + 8 = 13\).

Next, let's calculate the number of fruits brought by Kael:
- Kael brought twice the number of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of fruits brought by Kael is \(10 + 4 = 14\).

Now, let's find the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:

2. **Second Segment:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour.
   - Total time available is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:
     \[
     7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
     \]
   - Distance covered in the second segment:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}

1. **Identify the total number of letters needing stamps:**
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.

2. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped:**
   Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie's work:**
   After stamping 20 letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30.

4. **Calculate the number of letters already in the already-stamped pile before Jennie began:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of letters already in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began. After adding the 20 letters she stamped, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is:
   \[
   x + 20 = 30

Thus, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,10
mgsm-en-141,"Let's denote the number of queens as \( q \). According to the problem, the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2q \). The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2q = 4q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7q = 700 \]
To find \( q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\).",400,400

Next, we need to find out how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we calculate his weekly earnings from working as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is \(\boxed{140}\).",140,140
mgsm-en-143,"To determine the total cost of everything John bought, we need to first identify which items are food and which are non-food, and then apply the tax to the non-food items.

   - Eggs: $3 (food)
   - Light bulbs: $3 (non-food)
   - Cups: $3 (non-food)
   - Roach traps: $4 (non-food)

2. **Calculate the total cost of the non-food items:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of non-food items} = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:**
   \[
   \text{Tax on non-food items} = 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar}

mgsm-en-144,"First, let's determine the total number of clients Kim will have. He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients will be:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required for these 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]
And the total number of packs of cloths needed is:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, so the total cost for the bleach is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \]
The cost of each pack of cloths is $5, so the total cost for the cloths is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
Therefore, the total expenses for the bleach and cloths are:
\[ 32 + 40 = 72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so the profit is:
\[ 92 - 72 = 20 \]

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine the number of harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we know that John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests he can make in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year by multiplying the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

1. Identify the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
2. Use Dorothy's number of friends to find out how many friends James has.

First, let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3D = 12 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we need to find out how many Facebook friends James has. The problem states that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4D \]

Substituting the value of \( D \) (which is 4) into the equation, we get:

  - On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles.
  - Total tires inflated for bicycles: \( 5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires} \).

- **Tricycles:**
  - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
  - On the first day, 3 people came with tricycles.
  - Total tires inflated for tricycles: \( 3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires} \).

- **Unicycles:**
  - Each unicycle has 1 tire.
  - On the first day, 1 person came with a unicycle.
  - Total tires inflated for unicycles: \( 1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire} \).

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[
10 \text{ tires (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ tires (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ tire (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost for inflating all the tires is:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The number of fries left is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining fries. The number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).
5. Ants carried off one final fry, so the number of fries left is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 \).
6. We know that after all these events, 5 fries were left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Adding 1 to both sides, we get:

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:

1. **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
   - Each day, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
   - Since he has classes on 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours for these three days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

2. **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
   - Each day, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
   - Since he has classes on 2 days (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours for these two days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Next, we add the hours from all the days to find the total number of hours per week:

     P_3 = P_2 + 0.20 \times P_2 = 28.8 + 0.20 \times 28.8 = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Generalize the price increase formula:**
   - The price after \( n \) two-month periods can be expressed as:
     \[
     P_n = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20)^n
     \]
   - Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we set \( n = 18 \):
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

4. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
     \]

5. **Calculate the final price:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\) dollars.",32,92
mgsm-en-163,"To determine the total value of all the toys in the room, we need to find the cost of each type of toy and then sum these costs. Let's start by defining the variables and using the given information to find the values.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the cost of one red car.
   - Let \( A \) be the cost of one action figure.
   - Let \( D \) be the cost of the doll.

2. **Given information:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures: \( D = 3A \).
   - One red car costs $4: \( R = 4 \).
   - The cost of an action figure is $5: \( A = 5 \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the doll:**
   \[
   D = 3A = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red cars:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red cars} = 5R = 5 \times 4 = 20

mgsm-en-164,"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant with the lost income from not doing freelance work.

First, let's calculate the lost income from not doing freelance work:
- Jackie loses $35 per hour of freelance work.
- She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.

\[
\text{Lost income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we compare this lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Now, we find the difference between the lost income and the cost of hiring the accountant:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Lost income} - \text{Cost of accountant} = 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-en-165,"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this from her budget of €1500.

First, let's list the costs of the items Elvira is purchasing:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: €74
- Mouse: €102
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

We can add these step by step:
\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]
\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]
\[
1321 + 102 = 1423
\]
\[
1423 + 157 = 1580
\]
\[
1580 + 74 = 1654
\]
\[
1654 + 102 = 1756
\]

The total cost of the items is €1756. However, this exceeds Elvira's budget of €1500. Therefore, it is not possible for her to purchase all these items with her current budget. 

Given the problem constraints, if we assume she can only purchase items within her budget, we need to find the maximum amount she can spend without exceeding €1500. We start by subtracting the largest items first to see how much she can afford.

First, we subtract the cost of the computer:
\[
1500 - 1090 = 410
\]

Next, we subtract the cost of the scanner:
\[
410 - 157 = 253
\]

Next, we subtract the cost of the CD burner:
\[
253 - 74 = 179
\]

Next, we subtract the cost of the printer:
\[
179 - 102 = 77
\]

Finally, we subtract the cost of the keyboard and mouse:
\[
77 - 74 = 3
\]

Thus, the total cost of the items she can afford is:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 + 74 + 3 = 1500
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[
1500 - 1500 = 0
\]

mgsm-en-167,"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( B + S = 24 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling all 60 potatoes and the total time for cutting all 60 potatoes.

**Total time for peeling:**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \)
- \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

**Total time for cutting:**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \text{ seconds} \times 60 \)
- \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds} \)

Now, we convert the total cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} = \frac{300}{60} \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

Finally, we add the total time for peeling and cutting:
- Total time for peeling = 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting = 5 minutes

First, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die that are greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the probabilities of these two events:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]
To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

First, we know that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples. According to the problem, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
\[
\text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Next, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother to find the total number of apples picked:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = 10 + 20 = 30

Thus, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-en-186,"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters. Each of the 10 hamsters is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Next, we know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the rodents is 160 pieces. Since 50 pieces of straw were used for the hamsters, the remaining pieces of straw were used for the rats and the rabbits. The number of pieces of straw used for the rabbits is 20 pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces of straw used for the rats is:
\[ 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. Then the total number of rats is \( 3r \), and the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats is:
\[ 6 \times 3r = 18r \]
We know this is equal to 90 pieces of straw, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 18r = 90 \]
Solving for \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. At this point, he has 25 pens.

2. **Ink Collection**: Each pen can be used to collect ink from 5 empty pens to make one full pen. So, after using 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens. He can use these 25 empty pens to make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens. Now, he has 5 new pens and 0 empty pens left.

3. **Repeat the Process**: Now, Ram has 5 pens, and he can use these 5 pens to make \( \frac{5}{5} = 1 \) new pen. After making this new pen, he will have 1 new pen and 0 empty pens left.

4. **Final Check**: Now, Ram has 1 pen, and he cannot make any more pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make one full pen, and he only has 1 pen left. So, he stops here.

Adding up all the pens, we get:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of letters Mike receives per week from his remaining pen pals. Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week, so the total number of letters he receives per week is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ letters} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 6 letters per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes per week is:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing per week is:
\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries} \]
So, after Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had:
\[ 19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries} \]

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \( x \). After receiving \( x \) fries from Ginger, Griffin had:

polymath-low-en-8,"First, we calculate the distance John travels in the first part of his trip. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we determine how far John travels in the second part of his trip. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic and then 0.5 hours (30 minutes) driving at 30 mph:
\[
\text{Distance in standstill traffic} = 0 \, \text{miles} \quad (\text{since he is not moving})
\]
\[
\text{Distance in 30 mph driving} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
\]

John then spends the remaining time of his 4-hour trip driving at 80 mph. The remaining time is:
\[
4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
\text{Distance in 80 mph driving} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Adding up all the distances he has traveled:
\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles}
\]

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home and then traveled a total of 315 miles, the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
\[
\text{Distance from home} = 315 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is \(\boxed{135}\) miles.",135,45
polymath-low-en-9,"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked.

1. **Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - Regular pay = \( 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Calculate the overtime pay for the additional hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so the number of overtime hours is \( 45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Overtime pay rate is 1.2 times the regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime pay rate = \( 1.2 \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \).
   - Overtime pay = \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = \( 400 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 460 \text{ dollars} \).

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% from the second month. First, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of 180} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54

Then, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 55 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 6 \times 55 = 330 \text{ dollars}

Finally, we sum the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of donuts} + \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 204 \text{ dollars} + 160 \text{ dollars} + 330 \text{ dollars} = 694 \text{ dollars}

polymath-low-en-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's define the variables and the annual costs and revenues:
- Initial cost to plant the tree: $90
- Annual growth of lemons: 7 lemons per year
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5
- Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3

The net profit each year can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = (\text{Number of lemons} \times \text{Selling price per lemon}) - \text{Annual cost} \]
\[ \text{Net profit per year} = (7 \times 1.5) - 3 = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \]

Now, we need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the total net profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree:
\[ \text{Total net profit after } n \text{ years} = n \times 7.5 \]
We set this equal to the initial cost and solve for \( n \):
\[ n \times 7.5 = 90 \]
\[ n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.",12,13
polymath-low-en-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \]

Next, Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first add 1 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners.",18,18

polymath-low-en-29,"To determine the cost of the boots, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots.

The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, the combined cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ B - 5 \]

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Let's denote the cost of the second pair of heels as \( 2 \times 33 \).

Calculating the cost of the second pair of heels:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we can write the equation for the combined cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, this combined cost is equal to the cost of the boots minus five dollars:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation by adding 5 to both sides:
\[ 99 + 5 = B \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]",104,104
polymath-low-en-30,"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to first find their current ages based on the given ratio and total age.

1. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.
2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
3. Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
4. Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 18:
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
5. Now, calculate Allen's current age:
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-en-31,"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the guesses from each friend.
2. Calculate the average of these guesses.

First, let's denote the guesses as follows:
- The first friend's guess is 80.
- The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate half of 80, which is 40, and then add 20 to it. This gives us \(40 + 20 = 60\).
- The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate 25% of 80, which is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), and then add this to 80. This gives us \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

Next, we find the average of these guesses. The average is calculated by summing the guesses and then dividing by the number of guesses. So, we have:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
