mgsm-th-47,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount John spent on the neckties. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue neckties John bought:**
   John bought neckties for $200, and each blue necktie costs $40.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue neckties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red neckties John bought:**
   John bought twice as many red neckties as blue neckties.
   \[
   \text{Number of red neckties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine the price of each red necktie:**
   Each red necktie costs 50% more than each blue necktie.
   \[
   \text{Price of each red necktie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red neckties:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red neckties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of all neckties:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of blue neckties} + \text{Total cost of red neckties} = 200 + 600 = 800
   \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on the neckties is \(\boxed{800}\) dollars.",800,800

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the cheaper rate (2 flowers for $1):

\[
\text{Number of flowers} = 18
\]
\[
\text{Cost per 2 flowers} = \$1
\]
\[
\text{Number of sets of 2 flowers} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]
\[
\text{Total cost at cheaper rate} = 9 \times 1 = \$9
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive rate (3 flowers for $2.50):

\[
\text{Number of flowers} = 18
\]
\[
\text{Cost per 3 flowers} = \$2.50
\]
\[
\text{Number of sets of 3 flowers} = \frac{18}{3} = 6

mgsm-th-199,"To determine how much Mark makes per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sentences Mark corrects for each publisher per week.
2. Calculate the payment per sentence for each publisher.
3. Compute the total payment per week for each publisher.
4. Sum the payments from both publishers to get the total weekly earnings.

First, we know that Mark corrects 1000 sentences per week in total, and he corrects an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Therefore, he corrects:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences per week for each publisher.} \]

Next, we know that the payment per sentence for Publisher A is 5 cents. Therefore, the payment per week from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Therefore, the payment per sentence for Publisher B is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]
So, the payment per week from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the payments from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, Mark makes \(\boxed{7500}\) cents per week.",7500,7500

   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 1 \text{ sandwich/day} \times 2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast:**
   - Carl eats scrambled eggs with cheese 3 days a week.
   - He uses more cheese in scrambled eggs than in one sandwich, but the exact amount is not specified. For simplicity, let's assume he uses the same amount as one sandwich (2 slices).
   - Total cheese slices for breakfast: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 6 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Baked Macaroni and Cheese:**

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each caramel-coated apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar. Therefore, the weight of each caramel-coated apple is:

First, let's break down the information given:
- The price of a half-dozen plates is $6,000.
- The price of 20 dozen cups is $1,200 less than the price of a half-dozen plates.

Step 1: Calculate the price of a full dozen plates.
Since a half-dozen plates cost $6,000, a full dozen plates cost:
\[ 6000 \times 2 = 12000 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine the price of 20 dozen cups.
The price of 20 dozen cups is $1,200 less than the price of a half-dozen plates, which is $6,000. So, the price of 20 dozen cups is:
\[ 6000 - 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate the price of a single cup.
Since 20 dozen cups cost $4,800, the price of a single cup is:

mgsm-th-226,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial number of each type of card.
2. Adjust the number of cards after the changes.
3. Calculate the probability of drawing a water-type card.
4. Convert the probability to a percentage and round to the nearest whole number.

Let's start with the initial number of cards:
- Fire-type cards: 30
- Grass-type cards: 20
- Water-type cards: 40

Next, we make the changes:
- 8 water-type cards are lost, so the number of water-type cards becomes \(40 - 8 = 32\).
- 14 grass-type cards are bought, so the number of grass-type cards becomes \(20 + 14 = 34\).

Now, we calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

The probability of drawing a water-type card is the number of water-type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounding 33.33% to the nearest whole number, we get 33%.

So, the final answer is:

   - Raymond has 40 gemstones.
   - Aaron has more than half of Raymond's gemstones.
   - Half of Raymond's gemstones is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) gemstones.
   - Therefore, Aaron has more than 20 gemstones. Let's denote the number of gemstones Aaron has as \( A \).
   - Since Aaron has more than 20 gemstones, the smallest possible value for \( A \) is 21.

2. **Determine the number of gemstones Shoba has:**

polymath-low-th-75,"To determine the average area of each level of the sandcastle, we need to first understand the areas of each level. We know that the top level (4th level) has an area of 16 square feet, and each level below it has an area that is 1.5 times the area of the level above it.

Let's denote the areas of the levels from top to bottom as follows:
- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: \(16 \times 1.5 = 24\) square feet
- Level 2: \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) square feet
- Level 1: \(36 \times 1.5 = 54\) square feet

Now, we can calculate the total area of the sandcastle by summing the areas of all four levels:
\[16 + 24 + 36 + 54 = 130\] square feet.

To find the average area per level, we divide the total area by the number of levels (which is 4):
\[\frac{130}{4} = 32.5\] square feet.

Therefore, the average area of each level is \(\boxed{32.5}\) square feet.",5,60

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the cheaper rate of $1 for 2 flowers:
- The number of flowers per dollar at the cheaper rate is 2 flowers per $1.
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers is \(\frac{18}{2} \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive rate of $2.50 for 3 flowers:
- The number of flowers per dollar at the more expensive rate is 3 flowers per $2.50.
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers is \(\frac{18}{3} \times 2.50 = 6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two rates:
- The cost at the cheaper rate is $9.

2. Determine the total amount of food needed per chicken per day.
3. Calculate the remaining amount of food needed for the final meal.

First, let's find out the total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendy gives 15 cups of food.
- In the afternoon, Wendy gives 25 cups of food.
- Therefore, the total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon is \(15 + 25 = 40\) cups.

Next, we know that each chicken needs 3 cups of food per meal. Since Wendy has 20 chickens and she feeds them three times a day, the total amount of food needed per chicken per day is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) cups.

Now, we calculate the total amount of food needed for all 20 chickens per day:
- \(20 \times 9 = 180\) cups.

Since Wendy has already given 40 cups in the morning and afternoon, the remaining amount of food needed for the final meal is:

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each lemon tree produces 7 lemons per year.
- Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from one lemon tree is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining one lemon tree:

1. Determine Raymon's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymon's son.
3. Calculate how many years ago Raymon's son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymon is 6 years older than Samantha. Therefore, Raymon's current age is:
\[ 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymon had his son when he was 23 years old. Since Raymon is currently 37 years old, the age difference between when he had his son and now is:
\[ 37 - 23 = 14 \text{ years} \]

This means Raymon's son is currently 14 years old. To find out how many years ago Raymon's son was born, we note that if Raymon's son is currently 14 years old, he was born 14 years ago.

Thus, the answer is:

The price after the discount is 75% of the original price because a 25% discount means the book is sold at 75% of its original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

mgsm-th-30,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrel and Allen based on the given ratio and total age, and then calculate Allen's age in 10 years.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( D \) be Darrel's current age and \( A \) be Allen's current age.

2. **Set Up the Ratio:**
   The ratio of Darrel's age to Allen's age is given as 7:11. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11}A
   \]

3. **Set Up the Total Age Equation:**
   The total age of Darrel and Allen is 162 years. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   D + A = 162
   \]

4. **Substitute the Ratio into the Total Age Equation:**
   Substitute \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the total age equation:

1. Dená can jog at four times the speed she can walk.
2. Dená can walk and jog at half the speed she can jog.
3. Dená's walking and jogging speed is 3 miles per hour.

From this, we can determine Dená's walking and jogging speeds:
- Walking speed = 3 miles per hour
- Jogging speed = 4 times the walking speed = 4 * 3 = 12 miles per hour

Next, we need to calculate the time spent walking and jogging in the given 6 hours:
- Time spent jogging = \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 6 hours = 2 hours
- Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3}\) of 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered during each activity:
- Distance covered while jogging = Jogging speed * Time spent jogging = 12 miles per hour * 2 hours = 24 miles
- Distance covered while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking = 3 miles per hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Finally, we add the distances covered during jogging and walking to find the total distance Dená can cover in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 24 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Next, substitute \( D \) and \( C \) into the third equation:
\[ 60 + 120 > 12R \]
\[ 180 > 12R \]
\[ R < \frac{180}{12} \]
\[ R < 15 \]

Since \( R \) must be a whole number, the maximum possible value for \( R \) is 14. However, the exact value of \( R \) is not needed to find the total number of pets. The total number of pets is the sum of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ D + C + R = 60 + 120 + R = 180 + R \]

Since \( R \) can be any integer from 0 to 14, the total number of pets will be between 180 and 194. However, the problem does not specify the exact number of rabbits, so we can only express the total number of pets in terms of \( R \). But if we assume the maximum possible value for \( R \) (which is 14), the total number of pets would be:
\[ 180 + 14 = 194 \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the area is:
\[ \boxed{194} \]",194,348

1. Determine the number of boys in the class.
2. Determine the number of girls in the class.
3. Calculate the number of girls who are in the drama club.

First, we know that the total number of students is 200. The fraction of boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \).

The number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the drama club. So, the number of girls in the drama club is:

mgsm-th-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Frieda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes Frieda used in the sauce.
2. Calculate how many tomatoes were used based on the volume of tomatoes per can.

First, we know that the sauce Frieda made has a volume of 32 ounces. Since the volume of tomatoes is reduced by half when made into the sauce, the original volume of tomatoes before reduction is twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces of tomatoes and there are three tomatoes in each can. Therefore, the volume of tomatoes per can is:
\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \]

To find out how many cans of tomatoes Frieda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of tomatoes per can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes Frieda used is:

2. Determine how many cars moved in the last 15 minutes.
3. Determine how many cars used the exit and did not move through the traffic jam.
4. Calculate the number of cars that moved in the first 15 minutes.

Let's start with the given information:
- Initially, there are 30 cars on the highway.
- In the last 15 minutes, 20 cars moved through the traffic jam.
- 5 cars used the exit and did not move through the traffic jam.

First, we calculate the number of cars that did not move through the traffic jam:
- Cars that used the exit: 5 cars
- Cars that did not move through the traffic jam (but are still on the highway): 20 cars

So, the total number of cars that did not move through the traffic jam is:
\[ 5 + 20 = 25 \text{ cars} \]

Since there were initially 30 cars, the number of cars that moved through the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars that moved through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,5

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell more than the first friend by \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the first friend's presses. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 more times than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

1. **Determine the internal dimensions of a single box:**
   - The external dimensions of each box are 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches.
   - Since the sides of the box are 1 inch thick, the internal dimensions will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   Therefore, the internal dimensions are:
   \[
   (5 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (6 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (4 - 2) \text{ inches} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches}

mgsm-th-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Franky watches on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spends watching TV each day and then focus on Wednesday's specific time.

First, let's summarize the time spent watching TV each day:

- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour per episode, 1 episode each day.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Wednesday**: 30 minutes per episode, \(x\) episodes.
  \[
  30 \text{ minutes} \times x = 0.5x \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Thursday**: 1 hour per episode, 1 episode in the morning, 30 minutes per episode, 1 episode in the evening.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Friday**: 1 hour per episode, 2 episodes.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:
\[
2 \text{ hours (Monday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Combine the known hours:
\[
2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Set up the equation to find \(x\):
\[
7.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 7.5 from both sides:
\[
0.5x = 7 - 7.5
\]
\[
0.5x = -0.5
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[
x = \frac{-0.5}{0.5}
\]
\[
x = -1
\]

Since \(x\) must be a non-negative integer, there seems to be an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Rechecking the problem, we see that the total time should be 7 hours, and the equation should be:
\[
7.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Revising the total time:
\[
7.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]
\[
0.5x = 7 - 7.5
\]
\[
0.5x = -0.5
\]

This indicates an inconsistency. Given the problem constraints, the correct interpretation is that Franky watches 1 episode on Wednesday.

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Franky watches on Wednesday is \(\boxed{1}\).",1,3

4. Determine the amount of water that will enter the boat during this time.

First, we know that Julia needs to travel 64 feet to reach the shore. The problem states that for every 10 feet she paddles, 2 liters of water enter the boat. Therefore, the rate of water entering the boat is:

\[ \text{Rate of water entering} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Julia to travel 64 feet. The problem states that Julia takes 10.5 seconds (or 10.5/60 minutes) to travel 20 feet. Therefore, the time it takes to travel 1 foot is:

\[ \text{Time per foot} = \frac{10.5 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = 0.525 \text{ seconds per foot} \]

The total time to travel 64 feet is:

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( n \) be the number of tablespoons of sugar.
- Let \( w \) be the number of glasses of water.

According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{n}{w} = \frac{7}{13} \]

This implies:
\[ n = \frac{7}{13} w \]

We also know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 units:
\[ n + w = 120 \]

Substituting \( n = \frac{7}{13} w \) into the equation \( n + w = 120 \):
\[ \frac{7}{13} w + w = 120 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7w}{13} + \frac{13w}{13} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20w}{13} = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( w \):
\[ 20w = 120 \times 13 \]
\[ 20w = 1560 \]
\[ w = \frac{1560}{20} \]
\[ w = 78 \]

Now that we have \( w = 78 \), we can find \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{7}{13} w \]

1. **Determine the initial salaries:**
   - Let \( A \) be the initial salary of Adrian.
   - Let \( L \) be the initial salary of Lailah.
   - According to the problem, Adrian's initial salary is $40,000.
   - Adrian's salary is 30% more than Lailah's salary. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
     \]
   - Substituting \( A = 40,000 \):
     \[
     40,000 = 1.3L
     \]
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate the salaries after four years:**
   - Adrian's salary after four years increases by 40%. Therefore, the new salary of Adrian is:
     \[
     A_{\text{new}} = 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
     \]
   - Lailah's salary after four years also increases by 40%. Therefore, the new salary of Lailah is:
     \[
     L_{\text{new}} = 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92
     \]

3. **Calculate the total salaries after four years:**
   - The total salary of both Adrian and Lailah after four years is:
     \[
     A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92

1. Calculate the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month.
3. Calculate the total number of sheets of paper used in a month.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week. Each sheet of paper is part of a pad that contains 30 sheets. Therefore, the number of pads he uses per week is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ sheets/week}}{30 \text{ sheets/pad}} = \frac{1}{15} \text{ pads/week} \]

Next, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. For simplicity, we will assume a month has approximately 4 weeks. Therefore, the number of pads he uses per month is:
\[ \frac{1}{15} \text{ pads/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = \frac{4}{15} \text{ pads/month} \]

Since each pad contains 30 sheets, the total number of sheets of paper he uses per month is:
\[ \frac{4}{15} \text{ pads/month} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 8 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Thus, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month is:

mgsm-th-124,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many letters were in the pile that Jenny started with before she began taping stamps on them. We know the following:

1. Jenny has a total of 60 letters that need stamps.
2. She has already stamped 30 letters.
3. She stamps one-third of the letters that need stamps.

First, let's determine how many letters Jenny stamped. Since she stamps one-third of the letters that need stamps, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

This means Jenny has already stamped 20 letters out of the 60 letters that need stamps. However, we know she has already stamped 30 letters in total. This implies that the 30 letters she has already stamped include the 20 letters she just stamped plus some letters that were already stamped before she started.

Let \( x \) be the number of letters that were already stamped before Jenny started. Then:

\[
x + 20 = 30
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, there were 10 letters that were already stamped before Jenny started. Therefore, the total number of letters in the pile before she started is the sum of the letters that needed stamps and the letters that were already stamped:

polymath-low-th-84,"Let's denote the number of games won by the football team as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost. This gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost (\( L = 7 \)), we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]",15,15

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( D \) be the number of dogs.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cats.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of hamsters.

2. We know from the problem that:
   - The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
   - The number of cats \( C \) is two times the number of dogs, so \( C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
   - The total number of dogs and cats is more than the number of hamsters by 12, so \( D + C = H + 12 \).

3. Substitute the known values into the equation:

   60 + 120 = H + 12
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   180 = H + 12

polymath-low-th-111,"To determine how much water will enter the boat when Julia reaches the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to paddle.
2. Determine the rate at which water enters the boat.
3. Calculate the total time Julia spends paddling.
4. Determine the total amount of water that will enter the boat during this time.

First, we know that the distance to the shore is 64 feet. Julia paddles 20 feet in 10 seconds. Therefore, the rate of paddling is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ seconds}} = 2 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total time Julia spends paddling to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet per second}} = 32 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we know that for every 10 feet paddled, 2 liters of water enter the boat. Since Julia paddles 64 feet, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 64 feet:
\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet per segment}} = 6.4 \]

Since water enters the boat at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet, the total amount of water that will enter the boat is:
\[ \text{Total water} = 6.4 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that will enter the boat when Julia reaches the shore is:

polymath-low-th-116,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tablespoons of sugar (n) that Kate used, given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13 and the total quantity of sugar and water combined is 120 units.

Let's denote the number of tablespoons of sugar as \( n \) and the number of glasses of water as \( m \). According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so we can write:
\[ \frac{n}{m} = \frac{7}{13} \]
This implies:
\[ n = \frac{7}{13} m \]

We also know that the total quantity of sugar and water combined is 120 units:
\[ n + m = 120 \]

Now, substitute \( n = \frac{7}{13} m \) into the equation \( n + m = 120 \):
\[ \frac{7}{13} m + m = 120 \]
To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7m + 13m}{13} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20m}{13} = 120 \]
Multiply both sides by 13 to clear the fraction:
\[ 20m = 1560 \]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[ m = 78 \]

Now that we have the value of \( m \), we can find \( n \) using the ratio:
\[ n = \frac{7}{13} \times 78 = 42 \]

So, Kate used 42 tablespoons of sugar. The final answer is:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - On the first day, there were 2 containers.
   - Each container had 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day was \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles.

2. **Final Condition:**
   - On the second day, the total number of vehicles was 30.
   - We need to find out how many additional containers were brought in on the second day.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of additional containers brought in on the second day.
   - Each container has 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the second day can be expressed as \(10 + 5x = 30\).

polymath-low-th-119,"Let's denote Adrian's initial salary as \( A \) and Laylah's initial salary as \( L \).

From the problem, we know that Adrian's initial salary \( A \) is 30% more than Laylah's initial salary \( L \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]

We are also given that Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000. So, we can substitute \( A \) with $40,000:
\[ A = 40,000 \]
Since \( A = 1.3L \), we can find \( L \) as follows:
\[ 40,000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Now, let's calculate their salaries four years later. Adrian's salary four years later is 40% more than his salary four years ago:
\[ A_{\text{new}} = 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \]

Since their salaries increased by the same percentage, Laylah's salary four years later is also 40% more than her salary four years ago:
\[ L_{\text{new}} = 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \]

The total salary of both Adrian and Laylah four years later is:
\[ A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary of both Adrian and Laylah four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\).",92,95200

1. Identify how many letters Jenny has already stamped.
2. Determine how many letters she still needs to stamp.
3. Calculate the total number of letters in the pile at the start.

First, we know that Jenny has already stamped 30 letters. According to the problem, she stamps one-third of the letters that need to be stamped. Let's denote the total number of letters that need to be stamped as \( x \). Therefore, the number of letters she has already stamped is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

We know that \( \frac{x}{3} = 30 \). To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 letters that need to be stamped. Since the total number of letters in the pile is the sum of the letters that need to be stamped and the letters that are already stamped, we add the 30 letters that are already stamped to the 90 letters that need to be stamped:
\[ 90 + 30 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the pile when Jenny started is \( \boxed{120} \).",120,10

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queen bees, worker bees, and drone bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 4Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = \frac{700}{4} = 175 \]

Since the number of drone bees is equal to the number of queen bees, the number of drone bees is 175. Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

mgsm-th-153,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many French fries were originally in the pack.

1. **Initial Consumption by Dave:**
   - Dave ate 14 French fries.

2. **Nightingale's Consumption:**
   - The nightingale ate half of what Dave ate.
   - Half of 14 is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) French fries.

3. **Total Fries Eaten by Nightingale and Dave:**
   - Dave ate 14 French fries.
   - Nightingale ate 7 French fries.
   - Total eaten by Dave and nightingale: \( 14 + 7 = 21 \) French fries.

4. **Remaining Fries After Nightingale:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of French fries in the pack initially.
   - Remaining fries after Dave and nightingale: \( x - 21 \).

5. **Peregrine Falcons' Consumption:**
   - Three peregrine falcons each ate 3 French fries.
   - Total eaten by falcons: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) French fries.
   - Remaining fries after falcons: \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

6. **Raccoon's Consumption:**
   - The raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   - Remaining fries after raccoon: \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \).

7. **Mite's Consumption:**
   - The mite ate the last 5 French fries.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 5 \).

8. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 5
   \]
   \[
   x - 30 = 5 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   x - 30 = 15
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 + 30

mgsm-th-162,"To determine the price of a bag of glass balls after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The price increases by 20% every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of glass balls is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months.
   - After 2 months, the price becomes \(20 \times 1.20 = 24\).
   - After 4 months, the price becomes \(24 \times 1.20 = 28.8\).
   - After 6 months, the price becomes \(28.8 \times 1.20 = 34.56\).
   - After 8 months, the price becomes \(34.56 \times 1.20 = 41.472\).
   - After 10 months, the price becomes \(41.472 \times 1.20 = 49.7664\).
   - After 12 months, the price becomes \(49.7664 \times 1.20 = 59.71968\).

   We can see that the price after \(2n\) months is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^n
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number of 2-month periods. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we substitute \(n = 18\):
   \[
   \text{Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}

mgsm-th-182,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current age of Jean based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Marnie's age two years ago:**
   - We know that two years ago, Marnie was half of Jean's age minus 5 years.
   - Jean's current age is 30 years, so two years ago, Jean was 28 years old.
   - Let \( M \) be Marnie's age two years ago. According to the problem, \( M = \frac{28}{2} - 5 \).

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member of the faster team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Since there are four members, the total time for the faster team is:
  \[
  55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds}

mgsm-th-184,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: calculating the probability of getting a number greater than 3 on a single roll of a six-sided die, and calculating the probability of getting two even numbers in a row. Then, we will compare these probabilities.

### Part 1: Probability of Getting a Number Greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 50\%
\]

### Part 2: Probability of Getting Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of getting an even number on a single roll is:
\[
\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 50\%
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of getting two even numbers in a row is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\%
\]

### Comparison
We need to compare 50% (the probability of getting a number greater than 3) with 25% (the probability of getting two even numbers in a row). Clearly, 50% is greater than 25%.

Therefore, the probability that Jerry will throw a number greater than 3 is greater than the probability that he will throw two even numbers in a row. The difference in probability is:
\[
50\% - 25\% = 25\%

mgsm-th-186,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hamsters are in each hamster cage and how many mice are in each mouse cage, given the total amount of hay distributed.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( m \) be the number of mice in each mouse cage.
- Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each hamster cage.

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 mouse cages, and each mouse gets 6 pieces of hay.
- There are 10 hamster cages, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of hay.
- There are 20 pieces of hay given to the rabbits.
- The total amount of hay distributed is 160 pieces.

We can set up the following equation based on the total hay distributed:
\[ 3m \cdot 6 + 10h \cdot 5 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 18m + 50h + 20 = 160 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 18m + 50h = 140 \]

We need to find integer solutions for \( m \) and \( h \). Let's solve for \( m \) in terms of \( h \):
\[ 18m = 140 - 50h \]
\[ m = \frac{140 - 50h}{18} \]

For \( m \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 50h \) must be divisible by 18. Let's test values of \( h \):

1. If \( h = 1 \):
\[ 140 - 50 \cdot 1 = 90 \]
\[ m = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

This is an integer, so \( h = 1 \) and \( m = 5 \) is a valid solution.

2. If \( h = 2 \):
\[ 140 - 50 \cdot 2 = 40 \]
\[ m = \frac{40}{18} \]
This is not an integer.

3. If \( h = 3 \):
\[ 140 - 50 \cdot 3 = -10 \]
This is not a valid solution since \( m \) cannot be negative.

Thus, the only valid solution is \( h = 1 \) and \( m = 5 \).

The formula to calculate the total amount after \( n \) months with a monthly interest rate \( r \) is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + r)^n \]

Here, the principal is $100, the monthly interest rate \( r \) is 0.02, and the number of months \( n \) is 3.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

1. Identify the amount of blue fabric used:
   - The problem states that one jacket uses 2 rolls of blue fabric.

2. Determine the amount of white fabric used:
   - The problem also states that the amount of white fabric used is half the amount of blue fabric.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fabric used is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) roll.

3. Calculate the total amount of fabric used:
   - Add the amount of blue fabric and the amount of white fabric together.
   - Total fabric used = 2 rolls (blue) + 1 roll (white) = 3 rolls.

Thus, the total number of rolls of fabric used for one jacket is \( \boxed{3} \).",3,3

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the renovations.
2. Determine the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the renovation costs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

First, let's find the new value of the house after the renovations. The original purchase price of the house was $80,000, and the renovations increased the value by 150%. So, the increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]
Therefore, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the renovation costs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is \(\boxed{70000}\) dollars.",70000,70000

polymath-low-th-4,"To determine how much food Wendy needs to give to the chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon.
2. Determine the total amount of food needed per chicken per day.
3. Subtract the amount of food already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much more is needed for the final meal.

First, let's find out the total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendy gives 15 cups of food.
- In the afternoon, Wendy gives 25 cups of food.
- Therefore, the total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon is \(15 + 25 = 40\) cups.

Next, we need to determine the total amount of food needed per chicken per day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of food per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken gets \(3 \times 3 = 9\) cups of food per day.

With 20 chickens, the total amount of food needed per day is \(20 \times 9 = 180\) cups.

Now, we subtract the amount of food already given from the total daily requirement to find out how much more is needed for the final meal:
- The total amount of food needed per day is 180 cups.
- The amount of food already given is 40 cups.
- Therefore, the amount of food needed for the final meal is \(180 - 40 = 140\) cups.

So, Wendy will need to give \(\boxed{140}\) cups of food in the final meal of the day.",140,20

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles/hour} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we analyze his return trip. He had 4 hours to return home, but he was stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he only had 2 hours of driving time. During the first 15 minutes (or 0.25 hours) of the remaining 2 hours, he drove at 30 miles per hour. The distance covered in this time is:

\[ 0.25 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 7.5 \text{ miles} \]

After that, he drove at 80 miles per hour for the remaining 1.75 hours. The distance covered in this time is:

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The downloads in the second month were three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the second month's downloads = \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) downloads.

3. **Third Month:**
   - The third month's downloads were 30% less than the second month.
   - Therefore, the third month's downloads = \( 180 - (0.30 \times 180) \)
   - Calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \)
   - Subtract this from 180: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \) downloads.

4. **Total Downloads:**
   - Sum the downloads from all three months.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
- Each lemon tree produces 7 lemons per year.
- Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue per tree is \( 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual expenses for each tree:

3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Michka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
\[
3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Michka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
\[
3 \times 42 = 126
\]

Now, we sum the costs of all the clothing:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243
\]

Therefore, Michka spent a total of \(\boxed{243}\) dollars on clothing.",243,243
polymath-low-th-27,"To determine how much Synthia spends on ice cream over 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ice cream servings Synthia consumes in 60 days.
2. Determine how many boxes of ice cream she needs to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we know that Synthia eats one ice cream serving per night. Over 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Each box of ice cream contains 15 servings. Therefore, the number of boxes she needs to buy is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/box}} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $4.00. So, the total cost for 4 boxes is:
\[ 4 \text{ boxes} \times 4 \text{ dollars/box} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Synthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16
polymath-low-th-28,"To determine the distance between the two rest stops, we need to identify the locations of each rest stop and then calculate the difference between these locations.

1. **First Rest Stop:**
   - Henry stops after riding 20 miles.

2. **Second Rest Stop:**
   - Henry stops 15 miles before reaching the end of his 60-mile trip.
   - Therefore, the second rest stop is at \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) miles.

3. **Distance Between Rest Stops:**
   - The first rest stop is at 20 miles.
   - The second rest stop is at 45 miles.
   - The distance between these two rest stops is \( 45 - 20 = 25 \) miles.

Thus, the distance between the two rest stops is $\\boxed{25}$ miles.",25,25
polymath-low-th-29,"To determine the price of the boots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the prices of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes.
2. Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes.
3. Subtract this total from the amount Gloria has budgeted to find the price of the boots.

First, let's denote the price of the first pair of high-heeled shoes as \( x \). According to the problem, the price of the second pair of high-heeled shoes is \( 2x \). The price of the first pair is given as $33, so we have:
\[ x = 33 \]
Therefore, the price of the second pair is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

Gloria's budget is the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes plus the price of the boots. Since the total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is $99 and this is $5 less than her budget, her budget is:
\[ 99 + 5 = 104 \]

Thus, the price of the boots is:
\[ 104 - 99 = 5 \]

So, the price of the boots is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,104
polymath-low-th-30,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrel and Allen based on the given ratio and the total age, and then find Allen's age in 10 years.

1. Let's denote the current age of Darrel as \(7x\) and the current age of Allen as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. The ratio of their ages is given as 7:11.
2. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
3. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
5. Now, we can find the current ages of Darrel and Allen:
   \[
   \text{Darrel's current age} = 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \text{ years}
   \]
6. To find Allen's age in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-th-31,"To find the average number of jelly beans guessed by Gunter's friends, we need to determine each guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed more than half of the first guess by 20 jelly beans. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend guessed \(40 + 20 = 60\) jelly beans.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend guessed \(80 + 20 = 100\) jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average number of jelly beans guessed by Gunter's friends is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
