mgsm-ru-47,"First, let's determine the cost of one blue tie. According to the problem, each blue tie costs 40 dollars. Since John spent 200 dollars on blue ties, the number of blue ties he bought is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs 40 dollars, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

1. Identify the total number of years Marsi will work and the total pension she will receive.
2. Determine the additional pension she will receive after 20 years of service.
3. Calculate the annual pension for the 30-year period.

First, we know that if Marsi works for 40 years, she will receive a pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years of service, she receives an additional 5% of the pension amount for each additional year of service.

The additional pension she receives for each year after 20 years is 5% of $50,000. So, for each additional year, she receives:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Marsi will work for 30 years, she will have 10 additional years of service after the initial 20 years. Therefore, the additional pension she will receive for these 10 years is:
\[ 10 \times 2,500 = 25,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to her base pension of $50,000, her total annual pension after 30 years of service will be:

mgsm-ru-75,"To determine the average area of the levels in a 4-level sandcastle, we start by noting the relationship between the areas of the levels. Each level has half the area of the level below it. Given that the top level has an area of 16 square feet, we can calculate the areas of the other levels as follows:

1. The top level (Level 1) has an area of 16 square feet.
2. The second level (Level 2) has an area of \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet.
3. The third level (Level 3) has an area of \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet.
4. The bottom level (Level 4) has an area of \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet.

Next, we find the average area of the levels by summing the areas and dividing by the number of levels. The total area is:

\[16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240\]

Since there are 4 levels, the average area is:

mgsm-ru-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then divide this by the amount of food in each bag.

First, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required to provide 180 cups of food. Since each bag contains 110 cups of dog food, we divide the total amount of food needed by the amount of food per bag:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food to ensure she has enough for the first year.

mgsm-ru-77,"Let's denote the amount of laundry that David washes as \( D \) pounds. According to the problem, Sarah washes 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry that Sarah washes is \( 4D \) pounds. We are given that Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 4D = 400 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

So, David washes 100 pounds of laundry. Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond washes. The problem states that Raymond washes half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah washes 400 pounds, Raymond washes:

\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry that Raymond washes and the amount that David washes. This difference is:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

1. Calculate the total amount of carrots that will be used by the restaurants.
2. Subtract the amount of carrots used from the total amount of carrots available.

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. Each of the 40 restaurants will receive 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, the total amount of carrots used is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of carrots used from the total amount of carrots available. The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

1. **Identify the total number of control tests and the desired average:**
   - There are 6 control tests in total.
   - The desired average is 93.

2. **Calculate the total sum of scores needed to achieve the desired average:**
   \[
   \text{Total sum of scores} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

3. **Sum the scores of the first five control tests:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

4. **Determine the required score on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The sum of all six scores should be 558.
   \[
   438 + x = 558

     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 558 - 367 = 191

- Michael rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first period is:

   - The cost of 20 dozen (240) cups is:
     \[
     240x \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The cost of 20 dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     240x = 6000 - 1200
     \]
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:

mgsm-ru-210,"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the items she wants, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and the money she will earn from her activities.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The cost of the coat is $30.
- The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is $20 \times 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate the money Sara will earn from her activities:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 \times 4 = $20 from babysitting.
- Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she needs to mow the lawn as \( x \). So, she earns $4 \times x from mowing the lawn.
- She already has $10 saved up.

The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn \( x \) times is:

We need this amount to be at least $70:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn at least 10 times. The final answer is:

According to the problem, each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, and each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Additionally, the number of white chickens is 2 more than the number of red chickens, so we can express this relationship as \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed by the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( r = 4 \). To verify, we calculate the number of white chickens:
\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Now, we check the total number of eggs:
\[ 3r + 5w = 3 \cdot 4 + 5 \cdot 6 = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens is \( \boxed{4} \).",4,4

Let's also denote the time that has passed since the last known state as \( t \) minutes. We need to find the current amount of water in the small pool, \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Currently, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S_0 \) and the amount of water in the large pool 4 minutes ago as \( L_0 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ L_0 = 2S_0 \]

Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the current amounts of water in the pools are:
\[ L = L_0 - 4t \]
\[ S = S_0 - 4t \]

Given that \( t = 4 \) minutes, we substitute \( t \) into the equations:
\[ L = L_0 - 16 \]
\[ S = S_0 - 16 \]

We also know that currently, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ L = 4S \]

Substituting the expressions for \( L \) and \( S \) in terms of \( L_0 \) and \( S_0 \):
\[ L_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ L_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 64 \]
\[ L_0 = 4S_0 - 48 \]

We also know from the first condition that:
\[ L_0 = 2S_0 \]

So, we can set the two expressions for \( L_0 \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S_0 = 4S_0 - 48 \]
\[ 48 = 2S_0 \]
\[ S_0 = 24 \]

Now, we can find \( L_0 \):
\[ L_0 = 2S_0 = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

The current amounts of water in the pools are:
\[ L = L_0 - 16 = 48 - 16 = 32 \]
\[ S = S_0 - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( \boxed{8} \).",8,8

3. Calculate the new total number of cards.
4. Determine the probability of selecting a water-type card.
5. Convert the probability to a percentage and round to the nearest whole number.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial total number of cards.**
The initial number of cards is the sum of the fire-type, grass-type, and water-type cards:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \]

**Step 2: Adjust the number of water-type and grass-type cards after the changes.**
- James loses 8 water-type cards, so the new number of water-type cards is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]
- James buys 14 grass-type cards, so the new number of grass-type cards is:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the new total number of cards.**
The new total number of cards is the sum of the fire-type, grass-type, and water-type cards after the changes:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

**Step 4: Determine the probability of selecting a water-type card.**
The probability \( P \) of selecting a water-type card is the number of water-type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ P = \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

**Step 5: Convert the probability to a percentage and round to the nearest whole number.**
To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.3333\ldots \]
Rounding 33.3333 to the nearest whole number gives us 33.

The total number of coins is the sum of the silver and gold coins, which is given as 110. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

1. Identify the maximum distance Polli can throw the golden spear when holding the sapphire.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's range of fire.

First, we know that without the sapphire, Polli can throw the golden spear for 400 feet. When holding the sapphire, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the spear when holding the sapphire is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire for 1000 feet. Therefore, Polli can stand up to 1200 feet away from the dragon and still be able to throw the golden spear to hit it.

Thus, the final answer is:

polymath-low-ru-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300-gram package of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories.
3. Find out how many portions of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.
4. Convert the number of portions into grams.

First, we know that each portion of chips contains 250 calories. Since the package contains 5 portions, the total number of calories in the package is:
\[ 250 \text{ calories/portion} \times 5 \text{ portions} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories. Your daily goal is 2000 calories, so the remaining calories are:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many portions of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories. Since each portion contains 250 calories, the number of portions you can consume is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/portion}} = 0.8 \text{ portions} \]

Since each portion of chips weighs 60 grams (300 grams / 5 portions), the number of grams you can consume is:
\[ 0.8 \text{ portions} \times 60 \text{ grams/portion} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is \(\boxed{48}\).",48,48

1. Identify the initial number of stickers Candice had.
2. Determine how many stickers she used at work.
3. Calculate the number of stickers in the package she bought.

First, Candice initially had 80 stickers. She used one sticker for each of the 220 different coffee cups she decorated. Therefore, the number of stickers she used is 220. After using these stickers, she had 23 stickers left. We can set up the following equation to find out how many stickers were in the package:

\[ \text{Initial number of stickers} - \text{Stickers used} + \text{Stickers in the package} = \text{Stickers left} \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[ 80 - 220 + \text{Stickers in the package} = 23 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ -140 + \text{Stickers in the package} = 23 \]

To find the number of stickers in the package, we add 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Stickers in the package} = 23 + 140 \]
\[ \text{Stickers in the package} = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of stickers in the package is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163

2. Determine the number of red ties John bought.
3. Determine the cost of each red tie.
4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
5. Add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to get the total amount spent.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]
The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]
The total cost of the red ties is:
\[
10 \times 60 = 600
\]
Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

1. Identify the total pension amount after 40 years of work.
2. Determine the additional pension amount after 20 years of work.
3. Calculate the annual pension for 30 years of work.

First, we know that after 40 years of work, Marsi will receive a pension of $50,000 per year. This pension includes the base pension plus an additional 5% of the base pension after 20 years.

The base pension is the amount she would receive if she worked for 20 years, which is the same as the pension she would receive if she worked for 40 years minus the additional 5% she gets after 20 years. Let's denote the base pension by \( P \). After 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of \( P \), so the total pension after 40 years is \( P + 0.05P = 1.05P \). We know this total pension is $50,000, so we can write:

\[ 1.05P = 50,000 \]

Solving for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{50,000}{1.05} = \frac{50,000 \times 100}{105} = \frac{5,000,000}{105} \approx 47,619.05 \]

So, the base pension \( P \) is approximately $47,619.05. After 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of this base pension, which is:

\[ 0.05 \times 47,619.05 = 2,380.95 \]

Therefore, the total pension after 40 years is:

\[ 47,619.05 + 2,380.95 = 50,000 \]

Now, if Marsi works for 30 years, she will not get the additional 5% after 20 years. So, her annual pension will be the base pension \( P \), which is $47,619.05.

Therefore, the annual pension if Marsi works for 30 years is:

Each school has two basketball teams (one for girls and one for boys), and each team has 5 players. Additionally, each school sends one coach for each team.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the number of players per school:
   - Each school has 5 players on the girls' team.
   - Each school has 5 players on the boys' team.
   - Therefore, the total number of players per school is \(5 + 5 = 10\).

2. Calculate the number of coaches per school:
   - Each school sends one coach for the girls' team.
   - Each school sends one coach for the boys' team.
   - Therefore, the total number of coaches per school is \(1 + 1 = 2\).

3. Calculate the total number of people per school:
   - The total number of people per school is the sum of the players and coaches, which is \(10 + 2 = 12\).

4. Calculate the total number of people from all four schools:
   - Since there are four schools, the total number of people is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).

Thus, the total number of people who participated in the tournament is \(\boxed{48}\).",48,48

polymath-low-ru-69,"Let's denote the initial amount of money that Bailey had as \( x \).

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount of money she receives over these 8 weeks is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving this money, Bailey has a total of $100. This means that the initial amount of money \( x \) plus the $40 she received over the 8 weeks equals $100. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find the initial amount of money \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches in a week from weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 375 \text{ students} \]

The total earnings from the weekday classes are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 5625 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the Saturday classes:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles/hour} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we determine the distance he travels back home. He spends the first 2 hours in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 miles per hour:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

After this, he has 1.5 hours left to travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ miles/hour} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances he traveled in the second part of his journey:
\[ 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles} \]

Since he initially traveled 180 miles away from home and then traveled 135 miles back, the distance remaining from his home is:

mgsm-ru-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.50. Therefore, the annual revenue is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.50/\text{lemon} = \$10.50/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost**: The annual cost to maintain the tree is $3.
4. **Annual Profit**: The annual profit is the annual revenue minus the annual cost:
   \[
   \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50/\text{year}
   \]
5. **Break-even Point**: To find the break-even point, we need to determine how many years it will take for the total profit to equal the initial cost of $90. Let \( n \) be the number of years. The total profit after \( n \) years is:
   \[

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher.
- She works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks per year as a teacher.

The weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

The annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from training:
- Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach.
- She works 15 hours per week as a cheerleading coach.
- She works 50 weeks per year as a cheerleading coach.

The weekly earnings from training are:

mgsm-ru-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurt Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy to cover the total number of yogurts he eats.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set of 4 yogurts.

First, let's find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts per day, in 30 days he will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5.00 \text{ dollars/set} = 75.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

mgsm-ru-37,"To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his Lego sets.
2. Calculate the total amount of money John spends on video games.
3. Determine how much money John has left after buying the video games.
4. Verify that the remaining money matches the given information.
5. Calculate how many Lego sets John still has.

Let's start with the first step. John has 13 Lego sets and sells each for $15. So, the total amount of money he gets from selling the Lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys 8 video games, each costing $20. So, the total amount of money he spends on video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has some money left. According to the problem, he has $5 left. We can verify this by subtracting the amount spent on video games from the total amount of money he had:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
But the problem states he has $5 left, so we need to check the consistency. If he has $5 left, it means he spent:
\[ 195 - 5 = 190 \text{ dollars} \]
This means he bought 8 video games and had $5 left, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Now, we need to determine how many Lego sets he still has. Since he started with 13 Lego sets and sold all of them, he has:
\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \text{ Lego sets} \]

So, the number of Lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]",0,2
mgsm-ru-38,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed per mile. We start by finding out how many miles he runs each day and then sum these to get his total weekly mileage.

1. **Calculate the distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance run on the remaining two days:**
   On the remaining two days, John runs half the time he runs on the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day. So, the distance he runs on each of these two days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the remaining two days} = 1.5v \text{ miles}
   \]
   Since he runs on two such days, the total distance for these two days is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance on the remaining two days} = 2 \times 1.5v = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weekly distance:**
   Adding the distances from all three days, we get:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly distance} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]
   We know that John runs 60 miles in a week, so:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10

2. **Determine the running speed:**
   Dana can run at twice the speed of jogging.
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Determine the walking speed:**
   Dana can walk at one-fourth the speed of running.
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance covered while running:**
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculate the distance covered while walking:**
   \[

mgsm-ru-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the package of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you have left to consume to reach your daily goal.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.

First, we know that each portion of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 portions in a 300-gram package. Therefore, the total number of calories in the package is:
\[ 250 \text{ calories/portion} \times 5 \text{ portions} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for you to consume. Your daily goal is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories are:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each portion contains 250 calories and there are 5 portions in the package, each portion is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ portions}} = 60 \text{ grams/portion} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories, we use the fact that each portion is 60 grams and contains 250 calories. The number of grams you can eat is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/portion}} \times 60 \text{ grams/portion} = \frac{200 \times 60}{250} = \frac{12000}{250} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

   - Therefore, to produce 20 candles, Charli needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of honeycomb wax}
     \]
   - The cost of one pound of honeycomb wax and wicks is $10.00.
   - Thus, the cost for 2 pounds is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}

First, let's find out how many articles Meredit wrote each day:
- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2 \text{ articles}
  \]
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is:

mgsm-ru-46,"To determine how many stickers were in the pack that Kandice bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of stickers Kandice had.
2. Determine how many stickers she used at work.
3. Calculate the number of stickers in the pack she bought.

First, Kandice initially had 80 stickers. At work, she used one sticker per each of the 220 different coffee cups. Therefore, she used 220 stickers at work.

Let's denote the number of stickers in the pack she bought as \( x \). After buying the pack, the total number of stickers she had is \( 80 + x \). After using 220 stickers at work, the number of stickers left is \( 80 + x - 220 \). According to the problem, she had 23 stickers left after all this. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

To find \( x \), add 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of stickers in the pack she bought is \( \boxed{163} \).",163,163

   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   The problem also states that for every dog, there are two cats. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve times less than the total number of dogs and cats. First, we calculate the total number of dogs and cats:
   \[
   \text{Total number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]
   Since the number of rabbits is twelve times less than this total, we have:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \frac{\text{Total number of dogs and cats}}{12} = \frac{180}{12} = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of domestic animals:**
   The total number of domestic animals is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of domestic animals} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 15 = 195

   - The thickness of the walls is 1 inch, so the internal dimensions are reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Therefore, the internal dimensions are:
     \[
     (5 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (6 - 2) \text{ inches} \times (4 - 2) \text{ inches} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the internal volume of one box:**
   - The volume of a box is given by the product of its length, width, and height.
   - So, the internal volume of one box is:
     \[
     3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total internal volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, the total internal volume is:
     \[
     3 \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

Therefore, the total internal volume of all 3 boxes is $\boxed{72}$.",72,72
mgsm-ru-107,"To determine how many 30-minute series Franky watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total time he spent watching TV over the week and subtract the time spent on other days.

First, let's list the time spent watching TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \(x\) 30-minute series
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV over the week is given as 7 hours. We can set up the following equation to find \(x\):

\[
1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 2
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = 4
\]

Therefore, Franky watched \(\boxed{4}\) 30-minute series on Wednesday.",30,3
mgsm-ru-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). According to the problem, this year he wanted to bake twice as many cookies as last year, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping the cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50
mgsm-ru-109,"To determine the cost of 10 gallons of gasoline after receiving the cashback, we need to follow these steps:

mgsm-ru-111,"To determine how much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia traveled to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat during the trip.

First, let's find the total distance Julia traveled. We know that she traveled 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find the total distance she traveled in 64 seconds, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{d \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia traveled 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to determine the rate at which water entered the boat. We know that for every 10 feet she traveled, 2 liters of water entered the boat. Therefore, the rate of water entering the boat is:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat during the 80 feet trip:

\[
80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore is:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days.
2. Subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted.

First, we calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers each day, we multiply the number of days by the number of flowers planted per day:
\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we subtract the 5 flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:
\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

Therefore, the number of flowers Ryan will have after 15 days is \(\boxed{25}\).",25,25

1. Determine the maximum number of photos that can be stored in the phone of Brittan.
2. Use the information about the relationship between the number of photos in the phones of Jamil and Brittan to find the number of photos in Brittan's phone.
3. Use the information about the relationship between the number of photos in Brittan's phone and the number of ducks on the photo to find the number of ducks.

Let's start with the given information:
- The phone of Jamil can store 1800 photos.
- The phone of Jamil can store 6 times as many photos as the phone of Brittan.
- The maximum number of photos in Brittan's phone is 50 times the number of ducks on the photo that Jamil took in the zoo.

First, we find the maximum number of photos that can be stored in Brittan's phone:
\[ \text{Number of photos in Brittan's phone} = \frac{\text{Number of photos in Jamil's phone}}{6} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300. \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photos in Brittan's phone is 50 times the number of ducks on the photo. Therefore, we can find the number of ducks on the photo by dividing the number of photos in Brittan's phone by 50:
\[ \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{\text{Number of photos in Brittan's phone}}{50} = \frac{300}{50} = 6. \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen on the photo that Jamil took in the zoo is:

3. Determine the current selling price of each type of lumber.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2x4x10 lumber.
5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4x4x10 lumber.
6. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2x4x10 lumber:
\[
10 \text{ pieces} \times \$10 \text{ per piece} = \$100
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4x4x10 lumber:
\[
5 \text{ pieces} \times \$16 \text{ per piece} = \$80
\]

Now, let's determine the current selling price of each type of lumber. Since the prices have increased by 50%, the new prices are:
\[
\$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per 2x4x10 piece}
\]
\[
\$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per 4x4x10 piece}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 2x4x10 lumber:
\[
10 \text{ pieces} \times \$15 \text{ per piece} = \$150
\]

Then, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 4x4x10 lumber:
\[
5 \text{ pieces} \times \$24 \text{ per piece} = \$120
\]

Now, let's find the total revenue from selling all the lumber:
\[
\$150 + \$120 = \$270
\]

Finally, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - (\$100 + \$80) = \$270 - \$180 = \$90

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we know that after the new containers arrived, the total number of transport vehicles in the port is 30. Therefore, the number of transport vehicles that were added by the new containers is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Since each new container contains 5 transport vehicles, the number of new containers that were brought in is:

4. Sum the salaries of Adrian and Lila after four years.

**Step 1: Determine the initial salary of Lila.**

Adrian's initial salary was $40,000. This salary was 30% higher than Lila's initial salary. Let \( L \) be Lila's initial salary. Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Adrian's salary after four years.**

Adrian's salary after four years is 40% higher than his initial salary. So, his new salary is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lila's salary after four years.**

Since Lila's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrian's, her new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrian and Lila after four years.**

The total salary of Adrian and Lila after four years is:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

1. **Identify the total number of letters and the number of letters with stamps after Jennie's work:**
   - Jennie started with 60 letters in total.
   - After Jennie's work, there are 30 letters with already glued stamps.

2. **Determine the number of letters Jennie worked on:**
   - Since Jennie glued stamps on one-third of the letters without stamps, the number of letters she worked on is one-third of the total number of letters without stamps.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of letters without stamps initially. Then the number of letters with stamps initially is \( 60 - x \).
   - Jennie glued stamps on \( \frac{x}{3} \) letters. After her work, the number of letters with stamps is \( 60 - x + \frac{x}{3} = 30 \).

3. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   60 - x + \frac{x}{3} = 30
   \]
   To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
   \[
   180 - 3x + x = 90
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   180 - 2x = 90
   \]
   Subtract 180 from both sides:
   \[
   -2x = 90 - 180
   \]
   \[
   -2x = -90
   \]
   Divide both sides by -2:
   \[
   x = 45

   So, initially, there were 45 letters without stamps and \( 60 - 45 = 15 \) letters with stamps.

4. **Determine the number of letters with stamps after Jennie's work:**
   - Jennie glued stamps on \( \frac{45}{3} = 15 \) letters.
   - Therefore, the number of letters with stamps after her work is \( 15 + 15 = 30 \).

Thus, the number of letters with already glued stamps when Jennie started her work was \(\boxed{15}\).",15,10

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   The problem also states that for every dog, there are two cats. Therefore, the number of cats is twice the number of dogs.
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve times less than the total number of dogs and cats combined. First, we need to find the total number of dogs and cats.
   \[
   \text{Total number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180

Next, we need to calculate how long James slept. According to the problem, James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time that Harry slept. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{James's sleep time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the amount of time they slept:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep time} - \text{James's sleep time} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

polymath-low-ru-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Frida used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Frida prepares the tomato sauce, the volume of the tomatoes is reduced by half. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes used.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used**: Since the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes used, the volume of the tomatoes used is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces. Therefore, the number of cans used is:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes used by Frida is \(\boxed{12}\).",12,12
polymath-low-ru-98,"To determine how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of cars on the road.
2. Determine the number of cars that left the road.
3. Calculate the number of cars that remained on the road after the cars left.
4. Subtract the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the second 15 minutes from the number of cars remaining on the road after the first 15 minutes.

Let's go through the steps in detail:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the road.
2. 5 cars left the road and did not pass through the traffic jam.
3. Therefore, the number of cars remaining on the road after the 5 cars left is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]
4. In the first 15 minutes, some cars passed through the traffic jam. Let's denote the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). After these \( x \) cars passed, the number of cars remaining on the road would be:
   \[
   25 - x
   \]
5. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed through the traffic jam. So, the number of cars remaining on the road after these 20 cars passed would be:
   \[
   25 - x - 20 = 5 - x
   \]
6. Since no cars are left on the road after the second 15 minutes, we have:
   \[
   5 - x = 0
   \]
7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 5

1. Calculate the internal dimensions of one box.
2. Calculate the internal volume of one box.
3. Multiply the internal volume of one box by 3 to get the total internal volume of all 3 boxes.

First, let's find the internal dimensions of one box. The external dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the thickness of the walls is 1 inch, the internal dimensions will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the internal dimensions are:
- Length: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Width: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the internal volume of one box:

polymath-low-ru-107,"To determine how many 30-minute series Franky watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total time he spent watching TV over the week and subtract the time spent on the other days.

First, let's summarize the time spent watching TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: Let's denote the number of 30-minute series as \( x \). So, the time spent is \( 0.5x \) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV over the week is 7 hours. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 7 - 5.5 \]
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Franky watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute series on Wednesday.",30,3

First, let's calculate the total cost of the remaining wood.

**Cost of 2x4x10 Doses:**
- Each 2x4x10 dose costs $10.
- Sasha has 10 doses.
- Total cost for 2x4x10 doses = \( 10 \text{ doses} \times \$10 \text{ per dose} = \$100 \).

**Cost of 4x4x10 Doses:**
- Each 4x4x10 dose costs $16.
- Sasha has 5 doses.
- Total cost for 4x4x10 doses = \( 5 \text{ doses} \times \$16 \text{ per dose} = \$80 \).

**Total Cost:**
- Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 doses + Cost of 4x4x10 doses
- Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the remaining wood.

**Selling Price of 2x4x10 Doses:**
- Assume the selling price is the same as the cost (since no specific selling price is given).
- Total selling price for 2x4x10 doses = \$100.

**Selling Price of 4x4x10 Doses:**
- Assume the selling price is the same as the cost (since no specific selling price is given).
- Total selling price for 4x4x10 doses = \$80.

**Total Selling Price:**
- Total selling price = Selling price of 2x4x10 doses + Selling price of 4x4x10 doses
- Total selling price = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit.

4. Sum the salaries of Adrian and Lila after four years.

**Step 1: Determine the initial salary of Lila.**

Adrian's initial salary was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lila's initial salary. Let's denote Lila's initial salary by \( L \). Then we have:
\[ 40000 = L \times 1.30 \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary of Adrian after four years.**

Adrian's salary after four years increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000. Therefore, his new salary is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the salary of Lila after four years.**

Since Lila's salary also increased by 40% from her initial salary, her new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the salaries of Adrian and Lila after four years.**

The total salary of Adrian and Lila after four years is:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the total salary is:

polymath-low-ru-123,"To determine how many miles Rosi can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on her different speeds.

1. **Calculate the distance Rosi runs at 10 miles per hour:**
   - Rosi runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Calculate the remaining time and distance at 5 miles per hour:**
   - Total time available is 7 hours.
   - Time already used = 3 hours
   - Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours
   - Rosi runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Thus, the total distance Rosi can run in 7 hours is $\boxed{50}$ miles.",50,50
polymath-low-ru-124,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many letters were in the pail with pre-stuck stamps when Jennie started working. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of letters and the number of letters with pre-stuck stamps:**
   - Jennie has a total of 60 letters to process.
   - After processing, there are 30 letters with pre-stuck stamps.

2. **Determine the number of letters Jennie processed:**
   - Since there are 30 letters with pre-stuck stamps, the number of letters Jennie processed is \(60 - 30 = 30\) letters.

3. **Determine the fraction of letters Jennie processed:**
   - Jennie processed one-third of the letters without pre-stuck stamps. This means the 30 letters she processed represent one-third of the letters without pre-stuck stamps.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of letters without pre-stuck stamps. Then, \(\frac{1}{3}x = 30\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 30 \times 3 = 90\).

4. **Determine the initial number of letters with pre-stuck stamps:**
   - Since the total number of letters is 60 and 90 letters without pre-stuck stamps were processed, the initial number of letters with pre-stuck stamps is \(60 - 90 + 30 = 0 + 30 = 30\).

Therefore, the number of letters in the pail with pre-stuck stamps when Jennie started working is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,10
mgsm-ru-141,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of each type of bee in the hive and then find the number of worker bees. Let's denote the number of queen bees (маток) as \( q \). According to the problem, the number of worker bees (рабочих пчел) is twice the number of queen bees, so we can denote the number of worker bees as \( 2q \). Additionally, the number of drone bees (куколок) is twice the number of queen bees, so we can denote the number of drone bees as \( 2q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of worker bees, drone bees, and queen bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2q + 2q + q = 700 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 5q = 700 \]
To find \( q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ q = \frac{700}{5} = 140 \]
So, the number of queen bees is 140. Since the number of worker bees is twice the number of queen bees, we have:
\[ 2q = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]
Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( \boxed{280} \).",280,400

2. Determine how much money Jordan could earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, let's find out how many hours Jordan spends playing video games each week. Since he plays 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan could earn if he worked these 14 hours. Since he earns 10 dollars per hour, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of hours by his hourly wage:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jordan could have earned if he had worked instead of playing video games is \(\boxed{140}\).",140,140

\[10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar}\]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:

\[10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}\]

Now, we add the cost of the milk, which is 2 dollars, to the total cost of the non-food items:

\[2 + 11 = 13 \text{ dollars}\]

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles of cleaning solution and packs of tissues needed:
- Each client requires 2 bottles of cleaning solution and 1 pack of tissues.
- Total bottles of cleaning solution: \(8 \times 2 = 16\)
- Total packs of tissues: \(8 \times 1 = 8\)

Now, we calculate the total expenses:
- Cost of one bottle of cleaning solution: $2
- Cost of one pack of tissues: $5
- Total cost for cleaning solution: \(16 \times 2 = 32\)
- Total cost for tissues: \(8 \times 5 = 40\)
- Total expenses: \(32 + 40 = 72\)

The total revenue is given as $92. Therefore, the profit is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Expenses} = 92 - 72 = 20 \]

1. Calculate the number of pineapples John can harvest from one hectare in one harvest period.
2. Determine how many harvest periods there are in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we know that on one hectare, there are 100 pineapples. John can harvest these pineapples every 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many harvest periods there are in a year by dividing 12 by 3:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, John can harvest 4 times a year. Since each harvest period he can harvest 100 pineapples from one hectare, and he has 10 hectares, the number of pineapples he can harvest from one hectare in a year is:

\[ 100 \times 4 = 400 \]

Since he has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ 400 \times 10 = 4000 \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is \(\boxed{4000}\).",4000,4000

mgsm-ru-150,"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser to finish the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance from their home to the school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to travel 3 miles on his bicycle. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, 3 miles is equal to:
\[ 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet} \]
Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to travel 15840 feet is:
\[ \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to travel 2 miles on his skateboard. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, 2 miles is equal to:
\[ 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet} \]
Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to travel 10560 feet is:
\[ \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The time difference between Tim and Steve is:

First, let's calculate the number of tire inflations for each group of people:

1. For the 5 people on regular bikes (2 tires each):
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires} \]

2. For the 3 people on tricycles (3 tires each):
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires} \]

3. For the 1 person on a monocycle (1 tire):
\[ 1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire} \]

Next, we sum the total number of tire inflations:
\[ 10 \text{ tires} + 9 \text{ tires} + 1 \text{ tire} = 20 \text{ tires} \]

Since each tire inflation costs 25 cents, we calculate the total cost in cents:
\[ 20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the total cost into dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):

3. Three pigeons each ate 3 chips, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) chips. The remaining number of chips is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
4. A weasel stole two-thirds of the remaining chips, so the number of chips stolen by the weasel is \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \). The remaining number of chips is \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).
5. Ants took the last chip, leaving 5 chips. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):

- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Bill makes 60 baguettes each day.
- Total length of baguettes in feet: \(60 \times 2 = 120\) feet.

Since the baguettes are already in feet, we need to convert the lengths of the rugles and chocolate croissants to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
- Total length of rugles in feet: \(\frac{1200}{12} = 100\) feet.
- Total length of chocolate croissants in feet: \(\frac{720}{12} = 60\) feet.

Now, we sum up the lengths of all the baked goods:

mgsm-ru-164,"To determine how much more money Jacki will earn by hiring a tax preparer instead of doing it herself, we need to compare the costs and benefits of both options.

First, let's calculate the cost of doing the taxes herself:
- Jacki will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
- She will lose $35 per hour for those 3 hours.
- The total loss in income is \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of hiring a tax preparer:
- The tax preparer charges $90 per hour.
- Jacki will need to pay for the time it takes to do the taxes.
- Since the problem does not specify the exact time required, we assume the time required is the same as the 3 hours of freelance work she would lose, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.
- The total cost for the tax preparer is \(3 \times 90 = 270\) dollars.

Now, let's find the net additional cost or benefit by comparing the two scenarios:
- If Jacki does the taxes herself, she loses $105.
- If Jacki hires a tax preparer, she spends $270.
- The additional cost of hiring a tax preparer is \(270 - 105 = 165\) dollars.

Therefore, Jacki will lose an additional $165 by hiring a tax preparer. The final answer is:

mgsm-ru-165,"To determine how much money Elvira has left for clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from the total amount of money she has.

First, let's list the costs of the items Elvira is buying:
- Computer: 1090 €
- Monitor: 157 €
- Keyboard: 74 €
- Mouse: 102 €
- Scanner: 157 €
- CD burner: 74 €
- Printer: 102 €

Next, we sum these costs:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

Let's add them step by step:
\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]
\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]
\[
1321 + 102 = 1423
\]
\[
1423 + 157 = 1580
\]
\[
1580 + 74 = 1654
\]
\[
1654 + 102 = 1756
\]

The total cost of all the items is 1756 €.

Elvira has 1500 €. To find out how much money she has left for clothing, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has:
\[
1500 - 1756 = -256
\]

Since the result is negative, it means Elvira does not have enough money to cover the total cost of the items. Therefore, she cannot afford to buy all the items and still have money left for clothing.

Thus, the amount of money Elvira has left for clothing is \boxed{0}.",0,77

   - They received $25 in profit.
   - Let \( R \) be the total revenue.
   - Therefore, \( R - \text{total cost} = 25 \).

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the number of gallons made:**
   - They get 20 cups from each gallon.
   - Let \( S \) be the total number of cups sold.
   - Therefore, \( S = 20G \).
   - They sell each cup for $0.50.
   - Therefore, the total revenue \( R \) is \( 0.50 \times S = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - \( R - 5G = 25 \).

4. Calculate the donation to the charity.
5. Subtract the weekly expenses for his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.
6. Find the final amount of money Zaïd has left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaïd spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his monthly salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on fuel:**
   Zaïd spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his monthly salary on fuel.
   \[
   \text{Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining amount after rent and fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the donation to the charity:**
   Zaïd donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Subtract the weekly expenses for his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:**
   Zaïd gives 200 dollars to his daughter and 700 dollars to his wife each week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total monthly expenses for his daughter and wife are:
   \[
   \text{Weekly expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly expenses} = 900 \times 4 = 3600 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   However, since the remaining amount after rent and fuel is only 2500 dollars, and the monthly expenses for his daughter and wife are 3600 dollars, we need to check if the remaining amount is enough to cover these expenses. Since 2500 dollars is less than 3600 dollars, Zaïd cannot cover these expenses with the remaining amount. Therefore, the remaining amount after all the expenses and donation is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 2500 = 0 \text{ dollars}

Now, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. The problem states that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica. Therefore, we can calculate:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Finally, we sum the number of crabs each person has:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monica's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

   - Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - Let \(M\) be the current age of Mark.
   - Two years ago, Mark was \(M - 2\) years old.
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years more than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + \frac{28}{2}
     \]
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 5 + 14 = 19

First, let's determine the probability that the number rolled is greater than 3. The possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability that the number rolled is greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Next, let's determine the probability that the number rolled is an even number. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability that the number rolled is an even number is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Now, we need to determine the probability that the number rolled is an even number and then another even number. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 50%, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 50%. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening is:
\[
P(\text{even number and then even number}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is for the number to be greater than 3 than for two even numbers to be rolled in a row. We compare the two probabilities:
\[
50\% - 25\% = 25\%
\]

So, the number is 25% more likely to be greater than 3 than to be two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

First, we know that Jenna's mother collected 20 apples. According to the problem, Jenna collected half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Jenna collected as follows:
\[
\text{Number of apples Jenna collected} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we add the number of apples collected by Jenna and her mother to find the total number of apples collected:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 20 + 10 = 30

Thus, the total number of apples collected by Jenna and her mother is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-ru-186,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bunnies are in each of the 10 cages and then use that information to find out how many mice are in each of the 3 cages.

First, let's calculate the total number of bunnies and the total number of bunnies' straw consumption:
- There are 10 cages with bunnies, and each bunny gets 20 briquettes of straw.
- The total number of bunnies' straw consumption is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) briquettes.

Since the total number of bunnies' straw consumption is 200 briquettes and the total number of bunnies' straw consumption given is 160 briquettes, there seems to be a discrepancy. However, the problem states that the total straw consumption among the small rodents is 160 briquettes, so we need to focus on the mice and the bunnies' straw consumption.

Next, let's calculate the total number of mice and the total number of mice' straw consumption:
- Let the number of mice in each cage be \(x\).
- There are 3 cages with mice, and each mouse gets 6 briquettes of straw.
- The total number of mice' straw consumption is \(3 \times 6x = 18x\).

We know that the total number of mice' straw consumption is 160 briquettes, so we can set up the equation:
\[18x = 160\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{160}{18} = \frac{80}{9} \approx 8.89\]

Since the number of mice must be a whole number, and the problem implies that the number of mice in each cage is an integer, we need to check if there is a possible integer solution. Given the context, the closest integer solution would be 8 mice per cage, but the exact calculation shows a non-integer, which suggests a potential error in the problem setup or an assumption of integer values. However, based on the problem's context and the closest integer solution, we can assume the problem intends for the integer solution.

Therefore, the number of mice in each cage is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,5
mgsm-ru-187,"To determine how much Mandi will need to pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount**: Mandi initially owes Benedict $100.

2. **Monthly Interest Calculation**:
   - After the first month, the interest is \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\) dollars. So, the total amount after the first month is \(100 + 2 = 102\) dollars.
   - After the second month, the interest is \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\) dollars. So, the total amount after the second month is \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\) dollars.
   - After the third month, the interest is \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\) dollars. So, the total amount after the third month is \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\) dollars.

3. **Final Amount**: After 3 months, Mandi will need to pay Benedict $106.1208. Since we typically round to the nearest cent, the final amount is $106.12.

Thus, the amount Mandi should pay Benedict is \(\boxed{106.12}\).",12,106

mgsm-ru-236,"To determine the total number of pens Ram will have after using the pens and making new ones, we need to follow a step-by-step process.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **Usage and Recycling**: Each pen can be used until it is empty, and then its ink can be used to make a new pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, Ram can make 1 new pen.

Let's calculate the number of new pens Ram can make from the initial 25 pens:

- After using the first 25 pens, Ram will have 25 empty pens.
- From these 25 empty pens, he can make \( \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = 5 \) new pens. (Here, \( \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).)
- After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have 5 empty pens left from the new pens and no empty pens from the original 25 pens, so he now has 5 empty pens.

Now, Ram uses these 5 new pens, which will give him 1 more new pen and 1 empty pen left over (since \( \left\lfloor \frac{5}{5} \right\rfloor = 1 \) and \( 5 - 5 = 0 \) empty pens from the new pens, plus 1 empty pen from the used new pen).

So, after this step, Ram will have 1 new pen and 1 empty pen, plus the 5 empty pens from the previous step, making a total of 6 empty pens.

- From these 6 empty pens, he can make \( \left\lfloor \frac{6}{5} \right\rfloor = 1 \) new pen. (And he will have 1 empty pen left over, since \( 6 - 5 = 1 \).)
- After making this new pen, Ram will have 1 new pen and 1 empty pen, plus the 1 empty pen from the previous step, making a total of 2 empty pens.

Now, Ram uses these 2 new pens, which will give him 0 new pens and 2 empty pens left over (since \( \left\lfloor \frac{2}{5} \right\rfloor = 0 \) and \( 2 - 0 = 2 \) empty pens from the used new pens).

- From these 2 empty pens, he can make 0 new pens (since \( \left\lfloor \frac{2}{5} \right\rfloor = 0 \)).

So, after using these 2 pens, Ram will have 0 new pens and 2 empty pens left over. Adding these to the 5 empty pens he had before, he will have 7 empty pens in total, but no more new pens can be made from these.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram will have is the initial 25 pens plus the 7 new pens he made, which is \( 25 + 7 = 32 \).

4. Determine the number of students who exited through exit C from the remaining students.

Let's start with the initial number of students, which is 1000.

1. Calculate the number of students who exited through exit A:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who exited through A} = 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300

   So, after 300 students exited through A, the number of students remaining is:

mgsm-ru-242,"Initially, Mike was corresponding with 5 people. He stopped corresponding with 2 of them, so he is now corresponding with 3 people. Each of these 3 people sends him 2 letters per week, each letter being 5 pages long. Mike also writes a response to each letter, meaning he writes 2 letters (one response and one original) per person per week.

First, we calculate the total number of letters Mike receives and writes per week:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ letters/person/week} = 6 \text{ letters/week} \]

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

**Step 1: Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.**

The original cost of the house is $80,000. Josh invests $50,000 in repairs, which increases the value of the house by 150%.

The increase in value due to the repairs is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.50 = 120,000 \]

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. The price of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is calculated as:
   \[
   5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. For 16 glasses, we need to determine how many glasses are at the regular price and how many are at the discounted price. Since every second glass is discounted, we can divide 16 by 2:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ discounted glasses}
   \]
   This means there are also 8 glasses at the regular price.

4. Calculate the total cost for the 8 regular-priced glasses:
   \[
   8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Calculate the total cost for the 8 discounted glasses:
   \[
   8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. Add the costs together to find the total amount Kyle needs to pay:
   \[

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the first 2 hours of his return trip due to being stuck in traffic:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 0 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 0 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, we calculate the distance he travels in the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we calculate the distance he travels in the remaining time (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at a speed of 80 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

1. **Step 1: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the green and red houses.**
   - Melanie sold \(\frac{1}{3}\) of her vacuum cleaners in the green house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the green house is \(\frac{x}{3}\).
   - After selling \(\frac{x}{3}\) vacuum cleaners in the green house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).
   - Melanie then sold 2 vacuum cleaners in the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is \(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\).

2. **Step 2: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the orange house.**
   - Melanie sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the orange house is \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1\).
   - After selling \(\frac{x}{3} - 1\) vacuum cleaners in the orange house, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \(\left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1\).

3. **Step 3: Set up the equation based on the remaining vacuum cleaners.**
   - We know that after all the sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

\text{Total cost for shoes} = 3 \times 42 = 126 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we sum the total costs for all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Мишка потратил \(\boxed{243}\) долларов на все предметы одежды.",243,243
polymath-low-ru-27,"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ice cream portions Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many boxes of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, since Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream each evening, in 60 days she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ portions} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of ice cream she will need. Each box contains 15 portions, so we divide the total number of portions by the number of portions per box:
\[ \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 boxes is:
\[ 4 \text{ boxes} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/box} = 16.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16.00} \]",0,16
polymath-low-ru-28,"To determine how many miles Henry rode between his first and second stops, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. The total distance of the ride is 60 miles.
2. Henry made his first stop after riding 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the ride.

First, we calculate the distance remaining after the first stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the ride, we subtract 15 miles from the remaining distance to find out how far he had ridden by the time of his second stop:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry rode between his first and second stops is:
\[ 25 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Henry rode between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{5}\).",5,25
polymath-low-ru-29,"Let's denote the price of the boots as \( B \). According to the problem, the price of the first pair of heels is $33 and the price of the second pair of heels is twice that of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is therefore \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. The problem also states that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the price of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \).",104,104
polymath-low-ru-30,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrel and Allen based on the given ratio and their total current age, and then find Allen's age 10 years from now.

1. Let's denote Darrel's current age by \(7x\) and Allen's current age by \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
   Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]

2. Now that we know \(x = 9\), we can find the current ages of Darrel and Allen. Darrel's current age is:
   \[
   7x = 7 \times 9 = 63
   \]
   And Allen's current age is:
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]

3. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-ru-31,"To find the average of the guesses, we first need to determine the value of each guess.

1. The first friend guesses 80 marbles.
   \[
   \text{First guess} = 80
   \]

2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
   \[
   \text{Second guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   \[
   \text{Third guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the three guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by 3.
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
   \]

Therefore, the average of their guesses is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
