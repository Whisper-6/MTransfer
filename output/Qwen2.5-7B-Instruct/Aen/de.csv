mgsm-de-47,"First, let's determine the cost of the blue and red ties. We know that John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. Therefore, the number of blue ties John bought is:

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. We know that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
200 + 600 = 800 \text{ US-Dollar}
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

mgsm-de-49,"To determine how many apartments in the building are unbewohnt, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the building.
2. Determine the number of apartments that are bewohnt.
3. Subtract the number of bewohnte apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of unbewohnte apartments.

First, we calculate the total number of apartments in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments:
\[
15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ apartments per floor} = 120 \text{ apartments}
\]

Next, we find out how many of these apartments are bewohnt. We know that \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the apartments are bewohnt:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ apartments}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of bewohnte apartments from the total number of apartments to find the number of unbewohnte apartments:
\[
120 - 90 = 30 \text{ apartments}
\]

Thus, the number of apartments in the building that are unbewohnt is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30

1. Calculate the number of eggs Lloyd collects in a week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs that is.
3. Calculate the total earnings from selling those dozens of eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's hens lay 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs laid in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Lloyd sells the eggs for 2 US-Dollar per dozen. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

mgsm-de-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way with the cost of buying them in the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in 3-er-Packungen:
- Each 3-er-Pack costs 2.50 US-Dollar.
- To find out how many 3-er-Packs are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \(18 \div 3 = 6\).
- The total cost for 18 flowers in 3-er-Packungen is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15.00\) US-Dollar.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in 2-er-Packungen:
- Each 2-er-Pack costs 1 US-Dollar.
- To find out how many 2-er-Packs are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2 and round up to the nearest whole number because we can't buy a fraction of a pack: \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
- The total cost for 18 flowers in 2-er-Packungen is \(9 \times 1 = 9.00\) US-Dollar.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in 3-er-Packungen is 15.00 US-Dollar.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in 2-er-Packungen is 9.00 US-Dollar.

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

1. **Initial Number of Pokemon Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Number of Cards After the First Month:**
   After the first month, she had the triple of her initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, after the first month, she had 60 cards.

3. **Number of Cards After the Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 cards fewer than she did in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, after the second month, she had 40 cards.

4. **Number of Cards After the Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected double the number of cards she collected in the first and second months combined.
   \[
   \text{Total cards collected in the first and second months} = 60 + 40 = 100

2. Determine the new weekly earnings after the 5% increase.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the year based on the new weekly earnings.

Let's denote John's weekly earnings before the prize as \( W \).

### Step 1: Calculate the new weekly earnings
After winning the prize, John's weekly earnings increase by 5%. Therefore, his new weekly earnings are:
\[ W_{\text{new}} = W + 0.05W = 1.05W \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for the year
There are 52 weeks in a year. So, the total earnings for the year after the prize is:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 52 \times W_{\text{new}} = 52 \times 1.05W = 54.6W \]

### Step 3: Add the monetary prize to the total earnings
John also received a monetary prize of $5000. Therefore, the total amount of money John earned in the year 2000 is:
\[ \text{Total money earned} = 54.6W + 5000 \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( W \), we can express the final answer in terms of \( W \). However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the total money earned in terms of the prize and the increased earnings, the final answer is:

mgsm-de-210,"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the items she wants, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then figure out how much more money she needs after her initial savings and earnings from babysitting.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The cost of the jacket is $30.
- The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is $20 \times 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara will have after her initial savings and earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 for each time she babysits and $4 for each time she mows the lawn. She babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 \times 4 = $20 from babysitting. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn, so she earns $4x from mowing the lawn. Therefore, her total earnings are $20 + $4x.

Adding her initial savings to her total earnings, we get:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this amount to be at least $70:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn at least 10 times. The final answer is:

Let's denote the amount of water in the small swimming pool 4 minutes ago as \( S \) gallons and the amount of water in the large swimming pool 4 minutes ago as \( L \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the large swimming pool had twice as much water as the small swimming pool:
\[ L = 2S \]

Now, let's consider the current situation. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in the last 4 minutes, each pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small swimming pool is \( S - 16 \) gallons, and the current amount of water in the large swimming pool is \( L - 16 \) gallons. The problem states that now the large swimming pool has four times as much water as the small swimming pool:
\[ L - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

We already know from the first equation that \( L = 2S \). Substituting \( L = 2S \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 64 - 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 48 = 2S \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small swimming pool had 24 gallons of water. Since the small swimming pool has lost 16 gallons in the last 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small swimming pool is:
\[ S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Therefore, the small swimming pool now has \(\boxed{8}\) gallons of water.",8,8

   Yuri scored 10 points more than half of Naomi's points. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 points to this value:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. We can verify this by summing the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, and then solving for Jojo's points.

   Let \( J \) be the points scored by Jojo. The total points equation is:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]

5. **Solving for Jojo's Points:**
   First, sum the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
   Then, subtract this sum from the total points to find \( J \):
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points.",54,54
mgsm-de-220,"To determine how much time Carmen spent solving the puzzles over the weekend, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on the Kreuzworträtsel:
- Carmen solves 1 Kreuzworträtsel in 10 minutes.
- She solved 3 Kreuzworträtsel over the weekend.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Kreuzworträtsel is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the time spent on the Sudoku-Aufgaben:
- Carmen solves 1 Sudoku-Aufgabe in 5 minutes.
- She solved 8 Sudoku-Aufgaben over the weekend.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku-Aufgaben is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) minutes.

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent is \(30 + 40 = 70\) minutes.

Thus, the total time Carmen spent solving the puzzles over the weekend is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes.",70,70
mgsm-de-221,"Initially, the water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters of this water to water her garden. To find out how much water is left in the tank after this usage, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount:

\[ 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collects twice as much rainwater as the amount of water left in the tank. Since 30 liters are left, she collects:

\[ 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank now:

\[ 30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the final amount of water in the tank is:

mgsm-de-222,"Let's denote the number of geraniums Andy plants as \( G \). According to the problem, Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Therefore, the number of petunias Andy plants can be expressed as \( G - 40 \).

The total number of flowers Andy plants is the sum of the number of geraniums and the number of petunias. So, we can write the total number of flowers as:
\[ G + (G - 40) = 2G - 40 \]

We also know from the problem that Andy plants 90 geraniums. Therefore, \( G = 90 \). Substituting \( G = 90 \) into the equation for the total number of flowers, we get:
\[ 2(90) - 40 = 180 - 40 = 140 \]

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is \(\boxed{140}\).",140,140

mgsm-de-226,"First, let's determine the initial number of each type of card James has:
- Feuerartige: 30
- Pflanzenartige: 20
- Wasserartige: 40

Next, we account for the changes in the number of cards:
- James loses 8 of his Wasserartige cards.
- James buys 14 more Pflanzenartige cards.

After these changes, the new counts are:
- Feuerartige: 30 (unchanged)
- Pflanzenartige: \(20 + 14 = 34\)
- Wasserartige: \(40 - 8 = 32\)

Now, we calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[
30 \text{ (Feuerartige)} + 34 \text{ (Pflanzenartige)} + 32 \text{ (Wasserartige)} = 96 \text{ cards}
\]

Next, we find the probability that a randomly drawn card is a Wasserartige. This is the number of Wasserartige cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[
\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\%

- The base cost of the burrito is $6.50.
- Extra meat costs $2.00.
- Extra cheese costs $1.00.
- Avocado costs $1.00.
- Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50.

Adding these together, the total cost of the burrito is:

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, let's find out how many pieces her mother can place per minute. Since her mother can place half as many pieces as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mother's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, let's calculate their combined rate:

First, we calculate the total number of cake pieces initially available. Since Großmama Jones baked 5 whole cakes and each cake was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ cakes} \times 8 \text{ pieces per cake} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. Therefore, the number of pieces that the guests took is:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces that the guests took is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
polymath-low-de-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300 g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories.
3. Find out how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining calories.

First, we know that the 300 g bag of chips contains 5 portions, and each portion has 250 calories. Therefore, the total number of calories in the bag is:
\[ 5 \text{ portions} \times 250 \text{ calories/portion} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories are:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since the entire 300 g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams of chips that contain 200 calories is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{1250 \text{ calories/300 g}} \times 300 \text{ g} = \frac{200 \times 300}{1250} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \text{ g} \]

So, you can eat \(\boxed{48}\) grams of chips.",48,48
polymath-low-de-44,"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling 20 Bienenwachskerzen, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of Bienenwachs needed:**
   - Each pound of Bienenwachs can produce 10 kerzen.
   - Therefore, to produce 20 kerzen, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ kerzen}}{10 \text{ kerzen per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of Bienenwachs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the Bienenwachs and the dochte:**
   - The cost of the Bienenwachs and the dochte for 2 pounds is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ US-Dollar per pound} = 20 \text{ US-Dollar}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 kerzen:**
   - Each kerze is sold for 2 US-Dollar.

3. **Usage**: She used 220 Post-it-Notizzettel at work.
4. **Remaining**: She had 23 Post-it-Notizzettel left after all the usage.

Let's denote the number of Post-it-Notizzettel in the pack she bought as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it-Notizzettel she had after the purchase is:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it-Notizzettel, the number of Post-it-Notizzettel left is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after using 220 Post-it-Notizzettel, she had 23 left:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it-Notizzettel in the pack she bought is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163

polymath-low-de-50,"To determine how much Lloyd earns from selling the eggs he collects in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Lloyd's hens lay in a week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs that is.
3. Calculate the total earnings from selling those dozens of eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's hens lay 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs laid in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 1764 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 147 \text{ dozen} \]

Lloyd sells the eggs for 2 US-Dollar per dozen, so his weekly earnings are:

1. Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in one week.
2. Determine the total revenue based on the number of students and the fee per student.

First, let's find out how many students Judy teaches in one week. She teaches 5 dance classes daily on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), and each class has 15 students. Additionally, she teaches 8 dance classes on Saturday, each with 15 students.

The number of students taught on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 150 \text{ students} \]

The number of students taught on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

So, the total number of students Judy teaches in one week is:
\[ 150 \text{ students} + 120 \text{ students} = 270 \text{ students} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue. Since Judy charges $15 per student, the total revenue is:
\[ 270 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 4050 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Judy makes in one week is \(\boxed{4050}\).",4050,7425

Let's denote the area of the 4th level as \(A_4\), the 3rd level as \(A_3\), the 2nd level as \(A_2\), and the 1st level as \(A_1\). According to the problem, we have:
\[A_4 = 16 \text{ square meters}\]
\[A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square meters}\]

polymath-low-de-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required and then convert that into the number of bags.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 tablespoon of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food needed for 180 days = \( 1 \text{ tablespoon/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ tablespoons} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags required for the first 180 days:**
   - Each bag contains 110 tablespoons of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \text{ tablespoons}}{110 \text{ tablespoons/bag}} \approx 1.636 \text{ bags} \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags for the first 180 days.

3. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining days of the year:**
   - There are 365 days in a year.
   - Days remaining after the first 180 days = \( 365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - After the first 180 days, the puppy needs 2 tablespoons of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food needed for the remaining 185 days = \( 2 \text{ tablespoons/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ tablespoons} \).

4. **Determine the number of bags required for the remaining 185 days:**
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{370 \text{ tablespoons}}{110 \text{ tablespoons/bag}} \approx 3.364 \text{ bags} \).

Again, since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 4 bags for the remaining 185 days.

5. **Calculate the total number of bags needed:**
   - Total bags needed = bags for the first 180 days + bags for the remaining 185 days = \( 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ bags} \).

Thus, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year is \(\boxed{6}\).",6,5

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in 3-er-Packungen:
- Each 3-er-Pack costs 2.50 US-Dollar.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs to buy \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packs.
- The total cost for 6 packs is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) US-Dollar.

   - Wendi füttert ihre Hühner mit 15 Tassen Morgens.
   - Sie gibt ihnen 25 Tassen Nachmittags.
   - Therefore, the total daily futter consumption is:
     \[
     15 \text{ Tassen} + 25 \text{ Tassen} = 40 \text{ Tassen}
     \]

2. **Determine the futter consumption per hen:**

   - With 20 Hühner, the total daily futter consumption can also be calculated as:
     \[
     20 \text{ Hühner} \times 3 \text{ Tassen/Huhn} = 60 \text{ Tassen}

3. **Verify the consistency:**
   - We have two ways to calculate the total daily futter consumption:
     - \(15 \text{ Tassen} + 25 \text{ Tassen} = 40 \text{ Tassen}\)
     - \(20 \text{ Hühner} \times 3 \text{ Tassen/Huhn} = 60 \text{ Tassen}\)
   - There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let's recheck the problem statement and calculations.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - The problem states that Wendi füttert ihre Hühnerschar mit 15 Tassen Morgens und 25 Tassen Nachmittags, which totals to 40 Tassen.
   - The futter consumption per hen is 3 Tassen, and with 20 Hühner, it should be 60 Tassen.
   - The correct total daily futter consumption should be 60 Tassen.

5. **Determine the futter needed for the last meal:**
   - Since the total daily futter consumption is 60 Tassen and Wendi has already given 40 Tassen (15 Tassen Morgens + 25 Tassen Nachmittags), the remaining futter needed for the last meal is:
     \[
     60 \text{ Tassen} - 40 \text{ Tassen} = 20 \text{ Tassen}

mgsm-de-12,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.50. Therefore, the annual revenue is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.50/\text{lemon} = \$10.50/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost**: The annual cost to water and fertilize the tree is $3. Therefore, the net profit each year is:
   \[
   \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50/\text{year}
   \]
4. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it takes to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90. We set up the equation:
   \[
   7.50 \times n = 90
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of years. Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{90}{7.50} = 12

2. She has 2 vacuum cleaners in the red house.
3. After selling \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

First, we calculate the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after placing them in the green and red houses:
\[
x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2
\]

Next, we need to find how many vacuum cleaners were left before selling in the orange house. Let \( y \) be the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after placing them in the green and red houses:
\[
y = x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2
\]

Melanie then sells \(\frac{1}{2}\) of these remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y
\]

After selling, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
\[
y - \frac{1}{2}y = 5

Simplify the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y = 5
\]

Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 10
\]

Now substitute \( y \) back into the equation for \( y \):
\[
10 = x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
10 = \frac{2}{3}x - 2

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours are spent in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily time by 7:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends per week taking care of the dogs is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]",35,35
mgsm-de-33,"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We can express these conditions with the following equations:

1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \( \boxed{70} \) gold coins.",70,70

mgsm-de-35,"In the first 20 minutes, Mike makes 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he makes 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

To find out how many points he makes in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and then add that to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he makes:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:

Therefore, the total number of points Mike made is $\boxed{9}$.",9,9
mgsm-de-36,"To determine how much Terry spends on yoghurts over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the daily expenditure on yoghurts:**
   Terry buys 2 yoghurts per day. Given the current offer of 4 yoghurts for 5,00 US-Dollar, we need to find the cost of 2 yoghurts.

   First, calculate the cost of 1 yoghurt:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 yoghurt} = \frac{5.00 \text{ US-Dollar}}{4 \text{ yoghurts}} = 1.25 \text{ US-Dollar per yoghurt}
   \]

   Next, calculate the cost of 2 yoghurts:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 yoghurts} = 2 \times 1.25 \text{ US-Dollar} = 2.50 \text{ US-Dollar}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total expenditure over 30 days:**
   Terry buys 2 yoghurts every day for 30 days. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2.50 \text{ US-Dollar per day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 75 \text{ US-Dollar}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Terry spends on yoghurts over 30 days is \(\boxed{75}\).",75,75
mgsm-de-37,"First, we need to determine the total amount of money John received from selling his Lego sets. Since he sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, the total amount is calculated as follows:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money John spent on the video games. He bought 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

John had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount of money he spent on the video games and the amount of money he had left must add up to the total amount he received from selling the Lego sets. We can check this by subtracting the amount spent on video games from the total amount received:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

Since John had $5 left, we can confirm that:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 = 5 \]

This confirms our calculations are correct. Now, we need to determine how many Lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 Lego sets, the number of Lego sets he has left is:

\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \]

So, the number of Lego sets John has left is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]",0,2
mgsm-de-38,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to find his average speed in miles per hour. We start by calculating the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs 60 miles per week. He runs 3 days a week, with the first day being 3 hours and the other two days being half that time each.

The time spent running on the first day is 3 hours. The time spent running on the second and third days is each \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours. Therefore, the total time spent running in a week is:
\[
3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate his average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10
mgsm-de-39,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can cover in six hours given the specified proportions of time spent walking and running.

1. **Determine the running speed:**
   - Dana can hop at 3 miles per hour.
   - Since she can hop at half her running speed, her running speed is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine the walking speed:**
   - Dana can run four times as fast as she can walk.
   - Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then:
     \[
     6 = 4w \implies w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent walking and running:**
   - She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance covered while running:**
   - Distance covered while running:
     \[
     6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the distance covered while walking:**
   - Distance covered while walking:

mgsm-de-41,"To determine how far Polly can stand from the Drachen Perg and still be able to throw the golden spear into its range, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the original throwing distance of the golden spear without the Saphir-Edelstein.
2. Determine the increased throwing distance with the Saphir-Edelstein.
3. Calculate the new throwing distance and compare it to the Drachen Perg's flame range.

First, we know that Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet without the Saphir-Edelstein. With the Saphir-Edelstein, she can throw the spear three times as far. Therefore, the new throwing distance is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The Drachen Perg can breathe flames within a 1000-foot radius. Since Polly can now throw the golden spear 1200 feet, she can stand 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet outside the Drachen Perg's flame range and still hit the Drachen with the golden spear.

mgsm-de-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie goal and the calories already consumed, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total calories in one 300 g bag of chips:**
   - Each portion contains 250 calories.
   - A 300 g bag contains 5 portions.
   - Therefore, the total calories in one bag is \( 250 \text{ calories/portion} \times 5 \text{ portions} = 1250 \text{ calories} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining calories available for the day:**
   - Your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories available are \( 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \).

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since one 300 g bag contains 1250 calories, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories.
   - The ratio of calories to grams in one bag is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} \).
   - To find the grams of chips that contain 200 calories, we set up the proportion:
     \[
     \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{x \text{ grams}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200 \text{ calories} \times 300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \text{ grams}

mgsm-de-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). According to the problem, this year he wanted to bake twice as many cookies as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he actually has is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know from the problem statement that he has 110 cookies after dropping 5. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked \( \boxed{50} \) cookies last year.",50,50
mgsm-de-109,"To determine the cost of 10 gallons of gasoline after the refund, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline before the refund.
2. Subtract the refund amount from the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline before the refund. The price of gasoline is $3.00 per gallon. Therefore, the cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Calculate the total cost.**
3. **Determine the selling price of the boards.**
4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the boards.**
5. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the remaining boards

**2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
- Sasha bought 10 pieces at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) US-Dollar.

**4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
- Sasha bought 5 pieces at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \) US-Dollar.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost

Total cost = Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \] US-Dollar.

### Step 3: Determine the selling price of the boards

Assume the selling price is the same as the current market price, which has increased by 50% from the original price.

**2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
- Original price per piece: $10.
- New price per piece: \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \) US-Dollar.
- Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) US-Dollar.

**4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
- Original price per piece: $16.
- New price per piece: \( 16 \times 1.5 = 24 \) US-Dollar.
- Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 5 \times 24 = 120 \) US-Dollar.

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the boards

Total revenue = Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards
\[ 150 + 120 = 270 \] US-Dollar.

### Step 5: Calculate the profit

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - We assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adriens.
   - Lylah's new salary is \( 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.91 \) US-Dollar.

4. **Calculate the total combined salary:**
   - Adriens new salary: 56,000 US-Dollar.
   - Lylah's new salary: 43,076.91 US-Dollar.
   - Total combined salary: \( 56,000 + 43,076.91 = 99,076.91 \) US-Dollar.

2. Convert the total minutes into hours.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the patients.
4. Calculate the total cost to the hospital.
5. Determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes spent on consultations per day.**

Each patient is examined for 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients per day. Therefore, the total number of minutes spent on consultations per day is:
\[ 500 \text{ patients/day} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 2: Convert the total minutes into hours.**

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of hours spent on consultations per day is:
\[ \frac{12000 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the patients.**

The hospital charges $200 per hour for each patient. Therefore, the total revenue from the patients is:
\[ 500 \text{ patients/day} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 100000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday:**
   The total distance from Monday to Wednesday is given as 41 miles.

4. **Set up the equation for the total distance:**
   Let \( x \) be the distance Walt walked on Wednesday. The total distance from Monday to Wednesday can be expressed as:
   \[
   4 \text{ (Monday)} + x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 24 \text{ (Thursday)} = 41
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Combine the known distances:
   \[
   4 + x + 24 = 41
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   28 + x = 41
   \]
   Subtract 28 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 41 - 28

Grace's weight is 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than the 4-fold of Grace's weight. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
\]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[
\text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[
4 \times 125 = 500

polymath-low-de-84,"Let's denote the number of games won by the team as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team has won 8 more games than they have lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

polymath-low-de-98,"Initially, there are 30 cars on the highway. In the first 15 minutes, some cars pass through the traffic jam, and then 20 more cars pass in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars leave the traffic jam early, meaning they do not pass through it.

To find out how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to account for the total number of cars that eventually passed through and the cars that left early.

Let's denote the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars pass through. Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars left the traffic jam early, the number of cars that actually passed through the traffic jam is the initial number of cars minus the 5 cars that left early. This gives us the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, in the first 15 minutes, \( \boxed{5} \) cars passed through the traffic jam.",5,5

This means 250 pieces are already on the board. The number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750
\]

Next, Poppy's mother places one third of the remaining 750 pieces. We calculate this as follows:

First, let's calculate the total time spent watching TV on each day:

- **Monday**: Frankie watched one 1-hour episode.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Tuesday**: Frankie watched one 1-hour episode.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Wednesday**: Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched.
  \[
  x \text{ episodes} \times 30 \text{ minutes/episode} = 30x \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Thursday**: Frankie watched one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute episode.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}

Next, we sum up the total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:
\[
60 \text{ minutes (Monday)} + 60 \text{ minutes (Tuesday)} + 30x \text{ minutes (Wednesday)} + 90 \text{ minutes (Thursday)} + 120 \text{ minutes (Friday)}
\]

We know the total time spent watching TV is 7 hours, which is:

However, Henry accidentally dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he actually has is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know from the problem that he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

2. Determine the rate at which the boat takes in water.
3. Calculate the total time taken to row to the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake to find out how much water was taken in during the total rowing time.

First, we know that Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. The total time to reach the shore is 64 seconds. We need to find out how many 20-foot segments fit into the total distance rowed in 64 seconds. Since 64 seconds is 4 times 16 seconds, Julia rowed 4 segments of 20 feet each. Therefore, the total distance rowed is:

- Sasha bought 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ pieces} \times \$10/\text{piece} = \$100
  \]
- She also bought 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ pieces} \times \$16/\text{piece} = \$80
  \]
- Therefore, her total cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's determine the current price of the wood. The prices have increased by 50%, so the new prices are:
- For the 2 x 4 x 10 wood:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
- For the 4 x 4 x 10 wood:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining wood:
- She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 wood, and she sells them at $15 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ pieces} \times \$15/\text{piece} = \$150
  \]
- She has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 wood, and she sells them at $24 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ pieces} \times \$24/\text{piece} = \$120

- Therefore, her total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270

mgsm-de-141,"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees in the hive:
- Let \( K \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees (or drone bees).
- Let \( A \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( A = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees: \( B = 2K \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( A + B + K = 700 \).

First, we can express \( A \) and \( B \) in terms of \( K \):
\[ B = 2K \]
\[ A = 2B = 2(2K) = 4K \]

Now substitute \( A \) and \( B \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ A + B + K = 700 \]
\[ 4K + 2K + K = 700 \]
\[ 7K = 700 \]
\[ K = 100 \]

Now that we know \( K = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( A \):
\[ B = 2K = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ A = 4K = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( \boxed{400} \).",400,400

1. Determine the number of hours Jordan would work in a week if he replaced his video game time with work.
2. Calculate his weekly earnings based on his hourly wage.

First, we know that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours each day. If he replaced all of his video game time with work, he would work 2 hours each day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he would work in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we know that Jordan earns 10 dollars per hour. Therefore, his weekly earnings would be:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he worked instead of playing video games is \(\boxed{140}\).",140,140

- Glühbirnen (light bulbs): 3 Dollar
- Tassen (mugs): 3 Dollar
- Kakerlakenfallen (roach traps): 4 Dollar

The total cost of the non-food items is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ Dollar} \]

Next, we need to calculate the 10% tax on these non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ Dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ Dollar} \]

Now, let's add the cost of the food items:
- Milch (milk): 2 Dollar
- Eier (eggs): 3 Dollar

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ Dollar} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items to the cost of the non-food items including tax:

mgsm-de-144,"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate both his total revenue and his total expenses, and then find the difference between these two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total number of customers Kim will have:
\[ 3 \text{ (existing customers)} + 5 \text{ (potential customers)} = 8 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of Bleichmittel flaschen and Lappen packungen needed for all 8 customers:
\[ 8 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ flaschen Bleichmittel per customer} = 16 \text{ flaschen Bleichmittel} \]
\[ 8 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ packung Lappen per customer} = 8 \text{ packungen Lappen} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the Bleichmittel and Lappen:
\[ 16 \text{ flaschen Bleichmittel} \times 2 \text{ $ per flasche} = 32 \text{ $} \]
\[ 8 \text{ packungen Lappen} \times 5 \text{ $ per packung} = 40 \text{ $} \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 32 \text{ $} + 40 \text{ $} = 72 \text{ $} \]

Kim's total revenue is given as $92 per week. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total revenue:

1. Calculate the total number of ananas per hectare per harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can have in a year.
3. Multiply the number of ananas per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.

First, we know that John's field is 10 hectares and there are 100 ananas per hectare. Therefore, the total number of ananas per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ ananas/hectare} = 1000 \text{ ananas} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times John can harvest ananas in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, we calculate the number of harvests in a year:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, we multiply the number of ananas per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ ananas/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ ananas/year} \]

Thus, the total number of ananas John can harvest in a year is \(\boxed{4000}\).",4000,4000

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   In this period, she observed half as many bees returning as those that left in the first 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Bees returning} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   Debra observed twice as many bees leaving the hive as those that left in the first 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Bees leaving} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Bees that did not return in the first 12 hours:**
   The number of bees that did not return in the first 12 hours is the difference between the bees that left and the bees that returned in the first 12 hours.
   \[
   \text{Bees not returned} = 30 - 15 = 15

1. Identify the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
2. Use the number of Dorothy's friends to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can calculate the number of friends James has:
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has \(\boxed{16}\) Facebook friends.",16,16
mgsm-de-150,"To determine how long the winner waits before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from the school to their respective homes.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Steve to travel 3 miles to his home. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Steve travels at a speed of 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to get home is:
\[ \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Tim to travel 2 miles to his home. Since 2 miles is:
\[ 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Tim travels at a speed of 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to get home is:
\[ \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:

1. **First Group:**
   - 5 people each had both tires on their bicycles pumped up.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to pump up.
   - Therefore, each bicycle costs \(2 \times 25 = 50\) cents.
   - For 5 bicycles, the total cost is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) cents.

2. **Second Group:**
   - 3 people each had all three tires on their tricycles pumped up.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to pump up.
   - Therefore, each tricycle costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) cents.
   - For 3 tricycles, the total cost is \(3 \times 75 = 225\) cents.

3. **Third Group:**
   - 1 person had one tire on their unicycle pumped up.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to pump up.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on the days he has three 1-hour courses:
- Kimo has three 1-hour courses on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- Therefore, the number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on the days he has two 2-hour courses:
- Kimo has two 2-hour courses on Tuesday and Thursday.

mgsm-de-162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the original price of the bag of marbles, which is 20 dollars.
2. Determine the price increase every two months. A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by 1.20 every two months.
3. Calculate the number of 2-month periods in 36 months. Since 36 months is 18 two-month periods, we need to apply the 20% increase 18 times.
4. The price after 36 months can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: \( P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \), where \( P_0 \) is the original price, \( r \) is the rate of increase, and \( n \) is the number of periods. Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \).

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

mgsm-de-164,"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires a tax preparer instead of doing it herself, we need to compare the cost of hiring the tax preparer with the potential loss in income from not being able to work for those 3 hours.

First, let's calculate the loss in income if Jackie does the tax preparation herself:
- She loses 3 hours of work.
- She earns $35 per hour.

The total loss in income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we compare this loss with the cost of hiring the tax preparer:
- The tax preparer charges $90.

Now, we find the difference between the loss in income and the cost of hiring the tax preparer:
\[ 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, if Jackie hires the tax preparer, she will have:

mgsm-de-165,"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories, and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items Elvira is purchasing:
- Computer: 1090 €
- Scanner: 157 €
- CD-Brenner: 74 €
- Drucker: 102 €

Next, we sum these costs:

mgsm-de-167,"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which can be written as:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be written as:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   S + B + 4 = 28
   \]
   Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   S + B = 24
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( S \) with \( 2B \) in the second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16

mgsm-de-174,"To determine how long it will take Billy to prepare 60 Kartoffeln, we need to calculate the total time required for both peeling and dicing each potato.

First, let's calculate the time needed to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time needed to dice one potato:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to dice one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and dicing all of them.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling 60 potatoes
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes

\[
60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total time for dicing 60 potatoes
- Time to dice one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to dice 60 potatoes = \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds

\[
60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 3: Convert the dicing time from seconds to minutes
- There are 60 seconds in a minute.
- Total time to dice 60 potatoes in minutes = \( \frac{300}{60} \) minutes

\[
\frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the limonade:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( R \) be the total revenue from selling the limonade.
   - The profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, \( R - \text{Total Cost} = 25 \).

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost.
   - The total cost includes the cost of lemons and sugar.
   - The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.
   - The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons of limonade made.
   - The total cost is \( C = 3G + 2G = 5G \).

3. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of gallons:**
   - They sell each gallon of limonade in 20 glasses.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50.
   - Therefore, the revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue from \( G \) gallons is \( R = 10G \).

4. **Set up the equation for profit:**
   - Substitute the expressions for revenue and total cost into the profit equation:

First, let's calculate the total time for the first team:
- Each of the four runners runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for the first team is \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the second team:
- The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.

mgsm-de-184,"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die compared to rolling two consecutive even numbers, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The possible pairs of consecutive even numbers are (2, 4), (4, 6), and (6, 2) is not possible since the die is rolled only once for each number. Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible outcomes (since there are 6 outcomes for the first roll and 6 outcomes for the second roll, making a total of \(6 \times 6 = 36\) possible outcomes).

The probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is:
\[
P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18} \approx 0.0556
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two consecutive even numbers. We do this by dividing the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 by the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers:
\[
\frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two consecutive even numbers})} = \frac{0.5}{0.0556} \approx 9
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 9 times more likely than rolling two consecutive even numbers. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
9 \times 100 = 900\%

Therefore, the final answer is:

mgsm-de-186,"To determine how many rats are in each cage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Strohhalme given to the rats.
2. Determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total number of Strohhalme given to the rats.

First, let's find out how many Strohhalme are given to the hamsters. Each hamster gets 5 Strohhalme, and there are 10 hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ hamsters} \times 5 \text{ Strohhalme/hamster} = 50 \text{ Strohhalme} \]

Next, we know that the total number of Strohhalme given to the small animals (rats and hamsters) is 160. Therefore, the number of Strohhalme given to the rats is:
\[ 160 \text{ Strohhalme} - 50 \text{ Strohhalme} = 110 \text{ Strohhalme} \]

Each rat gets 6 Strohhalme, and the rats are divided equally among 3 cages. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage by \( r \). Then the total number of Strohhalme given to the rats is:
\[ 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ Strohhalme/rat} = 18r \text{ Strohhalme} \]

We know this total is 110 Strohhalme, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 18r = 110 \]

To find \( r \), we solve for \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{110}{18} = \frac{55}{9} \approx 6.11 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the problem implies an equal division, we need to recheck the interpretation. Given the context, it's clear that the division should be exact, so we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints or assume a possible rounding or simplification. However, the problem setup suggests an exact division, so we can conclude:

mgsm-de-236,"To solve the problem, we need to understand the process of recycling the ink from the empty pens to make new pens. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **Usage and Recycling**: After using these 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens. By mixing the ink from 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new pen. So, he can make 5 new pens from the ink of 25 empty pens.
3. **Repeat the Process**: Now, he has 5 new pens and 20 empty pens left (since he used 25 pens and made 5 new ones, he has 25 - 5 = 20 empty pens). He can mix the ink from 5 of these 25 pens (5 new pens + 20 empty pens = 25 pens) to make another new pen. So, he can make 5 more new pens.
4. **Continue the Process**: Now, he has 5 new pens and 15 empty pens left. He can mix the ink from 5 of these 25 pens to make another new pen. So, he can make 5 more new pens.
5. **Final Step**: Now, he has 5 new pens and 10 empty pens left. He can mix the ink from 5 of these 25 pens to make another new pen. So, he can make 5 more new pens.
6. **Last Step**: Now, he has 5 new pens and 5 empty pens left. He can mix the ink from these 5 pens to make 1 more new pen. So, he can make 1 more new pen.

Adding all the new pens he made, we get:
\[5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 21\]

So, the total number of pens he can have is the 25 pens he initially bought plus the 21 new pens he made:
\[25 + 21 = 46\]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram can have is \(\boxed{46}\).",46,31

1. Determine how many Bonbons Robert has.
2. Use Robert's number of Bonbons to find out how many Bonbons James has.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of Bonbons John and James have.

First, we know that John has 54 Bonbons and that John has twice as many Bonbons as Robert. Therefore, we can find out how many Bonbons Robert has by dividing John's number of Bonbons by 2:
\[
\text{Number of Bonbons Robert has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

First, we calculate the total number of pages Mike receives per week:
\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal per week} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages per week} \]

Since Mike writes a response for each letter, he also writes 30 pages per week. He can write 1 page in 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours worked.**

The Maskenbildner works 6 hours per day and does this 4 times a week. The film takes 5 weeks to complete.

\[
\text{Total hours per week} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week}

1. Calculate the total cost of the house including the repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house including the repairs.**

The initial cost of the house is $80,000. Josh spends an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.**

The value of the house increases by 150%. An increase of 150% means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 150% is equivalent to 1.5, and the original value is 1, so the new value is 1 + 1.5 = 2.5). Therefore, the new value of the house is:
\[ 130,000 \times 2.5 = 325,000 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new value of the house minus the total cost. Therefore, the profit is:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \text{ US-Dollar} \]

So, the profit Josh makes is \(\boxed{195000}\).",195000,70000

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, John turns around and starts driving back. He drives for 2 hours in the Stau, so the distance covered during this time is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 0 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 0 \, \text{miles} \]

After the Stau, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours total minus 2 hours in Stau minus 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph:

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's sum up all the distances he has covered in the 4 hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles} \]

polymath-low-de-10,"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month. First, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Then, we subtract this from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.

2. **Annual Income**: Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.50. Therefore, the annual income from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.50/\text{lemon} = \$10.50/\text{year}
   \]

3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and fertilize the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the annual income minus the annual expenses:
   \[
   \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50/\text{year}

polymath-low-de-13,"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, we know that Melanie has a third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners in the green house is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

Next, she has 2 vacuum cleaners in the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners in the red house is 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners left after placing them in the green and red houses is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2. \]

Melanie then sells half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the orange house is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1. \]

After selling these vacuum cleaners, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1. \]

We know that after all these transactions, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5. \]

To solve for \( x \), we add 1 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6. \]

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The ratio of their ages is 7:11.
2. The sum of their ages is 162 years.

From the ratio, we can express Darrell's age in terms of Allen's age:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We also know that:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting the expression for \( D \) from the ratio into the sum equation, we get:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]

Now, divide both sides by 18:
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen is currently 99 years old. To find Darrell's age, we use the ratio:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11} \times 99 \]
\[ D = 63 \]

Now, we need to determine Allen's age in 10 years:
\[ A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109 \]

- The third friend estimates 25% more than the first friend's estimate.

Let's calculate each estimate step by step:

1. The first friend's estimate is \(80\).
2. The second friend's estimate is \(20\) more than half of the first friend's estimate. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's estimate} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's estimate is 25% more than the first friend's estimate. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's estimate} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the three estimates: \(80\), \(60\), and \(100\).

To find the average, we sum these estimates and divide by the number of estimates:
\[
\text{Average estimate} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average estimate is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
