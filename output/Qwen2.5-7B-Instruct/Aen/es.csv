mgsm-es-47,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount John spent on both red and blue ties. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is:
     \[
     \frac{200}{40} = 5
     \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Since he bought 5 blue ties, the number of red ties is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - The cost of a blue tie is $40.
   - Therefore, the cost of a red tie is:
     \[
     40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**
   - John bought 10 red ties.
   - The cost of each red tie is $60.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the red ties is:
     \[
     10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - The total amount spent on blue ties is $200.
   - The total amount spent on red ties is $600.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent on all ties is:
     \[
     200 + 600 = 800
     \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

mgsm-es-52,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight is removed by taking out 30 comic book magazines and then figure out how many toys need to be removed to make up the remaining weight.

First, let's calculate the weight of the 30 comic book magazines. Each comic book magazine weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a pound. Therefore, the total weight of 30 comic book magazines is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic book magazines from the total weight:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many toys need to be removed to account for the remaining 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a pound. Therefore, the number of toys that need to be removed is:
\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

Thus, the number of toys that Uriah needs to remove is \(\boxed{15}\).",15,15
mgsm-es-53,"To determine which day the mechanic earned more and by how much, we need to calculate the earnings for each day separately.

First, let's calculate the earnings for Thursday:
- The mechanic repaired 6 neumáticos de camión, and each costs $60. Therefore, the earnings from the camión tires are:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic also repaired 4 neumáticos de automóvil, and each costs $40. Therefore, the earnings from the automóvil tires are:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings for Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for Friday:
- The mechanic repaired 12 neumáticos de automóvil, and each costs $40. Therefore, the earnings from the automóvil tires are:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic did not repair any neumáticos de camión, so the earnings from the camión tires are:
  \[
  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings for Friday:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we compare the earnings from Thursday and Friday:
- Thursday's earnings: $520
- Friday's earnings: $480

The difference in earnings between Thursday and Friday is:

mgsm-es-75,"To determine the average surface area of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to calculate the surface area of each level.

Given:
- The surface area of the top level (4th level) is 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the surface area of the level below it.

Let's denote the surface areas of the levels as follows:
- Level 4: \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet
- Level 3: \( A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \) square feet
- Level 2: \( A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \) square feet
- Level 1: \( A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \) square feet

Now, we sum the surface areas of all four levels:
\[
A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

To find the average surface area per level, we divide the total surface area by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average surface area} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average surface area of a level in Luke's sandcastle is \(\boxed{60}\) square feet.",60,60
mgsm-es-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use during the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of food required for the first 180 days.

Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. Therefore, the total amount of food needed for the first year is:

\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required. Each bag contains 110 cups of food. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total amount of food by the number of cups per bag:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food to ensure she has enough for the first year.

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use during the first year is $\boxed{2}$.",2,5

1. **Determine the amount of laundry Sarah does:**
   Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**
   Sarah washes 4 times more laundry than David. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
   \]
   Substituting the known value:
   \[
   400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
   \]
   Solving for David's laundry:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond does:**
   Raymond washes half the amount of laundry that Sarah does. Therefore:

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David wash is \(\boxed{100}\).",100,100
mgsm-es-78,"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the best price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both possible ways and then find the difference between these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in rams of 3 units each:
- Each ram of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) rams.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in rams of 2 units each:
- Each ram of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) rams.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in rams of 2 units is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in rams of 3 units is $15.
- The savings is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars by buying the flowers in rams of 2 units each.",2,6

Grace's weight is 125 libras. According to the problem, Alex's weight is 2 libras less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

First, we calculate \(4 \times 125\):

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then we subtract 2 from 500:

\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex's weight is 498 libras. Now, we need to find the combined weight of Grace and Alex by adding their weights together:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498 \]

1. Calculate the total amount of zanahorias that will be distributed to the restaurants.
2. Subtract the amount distributed from the total amount of zanahorias available.

First, we know that there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of zanahorias. Therefore, the total amount of zanahorias distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount of zanahorias available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of zanahorias that will not be used is:

mgsm-es-199,"To determine how much Mark earns in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of orations for each editorial:**
   - Mark revises a total of 1000 orations each week.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of orations for the editorial A.
   - Therefore, the number of orations for the editorial B is \( 1000 - x \).

2. **Calculate the payment from each editorial:**
   - The editorial A pays 5 centavos per oration.
   - The editorial B pays double the rate of the editorial A, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) centavos per oration.

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Earnings from the editorial A: \( 5x \) centavos.
   - Earnings from the editorial B: \( 10(1000 - x) \) centavos.
   - Total earnings: \( 5x + 10(1000 - x) \).

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   5x + 10(1000 - x) = 5x + 10000 - 10x = 10000 - 5x
   \]

5. **Determine the value of \( x \):**
   - Since the total number of orations is 1000, and the problem does not specify the exact distribution between the two editorials, we assume an equal distribution for simplicity (though it doesn't affect the final answer as the problem is symmetric in this case).
   - Therefore, \( x = 500 \).

6. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   \[
   10000 - 5(500) = 10000 - 2500 = 7500 \text{ centavos}

1. **Identify the current scores and the desired average:**
   - Scores of the first five exams: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86.
   - Desired average: 93.

2. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**
   - The average of six exams is calculated by summing all six scores and dividing by 6.
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth exam.
   - The equation for the average is:
     \[
     \frac{89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x}{6} = 93
     \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   - First, sum the known scores:
     \[
     89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
     \]
   - Substitute this sum into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{438 + x}{6} = 93
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to eliminate the denominator:
     \[
     438 + x = 558
     \]
   - Subtract 438 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

3. Calculate the additional amount of money Sara needs after accounting for her savings and earnings from babysitting.
4. Determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional amount of money needed.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- The cost of the chaqueta is $30.
- The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is $20 each, so $20 \times 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara will earn from babysitting:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times.
- Therefore, her earnings from babysitting are $5 \times 4 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting:
- Sara already has $10 saved.
- After babysitting, she will have $10 + $20 = $30.

\[ L = 4S \]

Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we need to determine how much water each pool has lost over the past 4 minutes. In 4 minutes, each pool has lost:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons} \]

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S_0 \) and the amount of water in the large pool 4 minutes ago as \( L_0 \). Since both pools have lost 16 gallons in the past 4 minutes, we can express the current amounts of water in the pools as:

\[ S = S_0 - 16 \]
\[ L = L_0 - 16 \]

We also know from the problem statement that 4 minutes ago, the large pool had the same amount of water as the small pool, so:

\[ L_0 = S_0 \]

Substituting \( L_0 = S_0 \) into the expressions for \( L \) and \( S \), we get:

\[ L = S_0 - 16 \]
\[ S = S_0 - 16 \]

Since \( L = 4S \), we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( S \):

\[ S_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16) \]

Expanding and solving for \( S_0 \):

\[ S_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 64 \]
\[ 64 - 16 = 4S_0 - S_0 \]
\[ 48 = 3S_0 \]
\[ S_0 = 16 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 16 gallons of water. Since the small pool has lost 16 gallons in the past 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is:

\[ S = S_0 - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0 \]

- Initially, James has 40 cards of type agua. After losing 8, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cards of type agua.
- Initially, James has 20 cards of type hierba. After buying 14 more, he has \(20 + 14 = 34\) cards of type hierba.
- The number of cards of type fuego remains unchanged at 30.

Next, we calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[ 32 \text{ (agua)} + 34 \text{ (hierba)} + 30 \text{ (fuego)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen card is of type agua. The probability is the number of agua cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pieces her mother can place per minute. Since her mother can place half as many pieces as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mother's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces at this combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

1. **Total weekly distance**: John runs 60 miles per week.
2. **Number of running days**: John runs 3 days a week.
3. **First day running time**: John runs for 3 hours on the first day.
4. **First day distance**: Let \( d \) be the distance John runs on the first day. Since he runs for 3 hours, his speed on the first day is \( \frac{d}{3} \) miles per hour.

5. **Distance on the other two days**: Let \( D \) be the distance John runs on each of the other two days. Since the first day's distance is the sum of the distances on the other two days, we have:
   \[
   d = D + D = 2D
   \]
   Therefore, \( D = \frac{d}{2} \).

6. **Total weekly distance equation**: The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances on all three days:
   \[
   d + D + D = 60
   \]
   Substituting \( D = \frac{d}{2} \):
   \[
   d + \frac{d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 60
   \]
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   d + d = 60
   \]
   \[
   2d = 60
   \]
   \[
   d = 30
   \]

7. **Distance on the other two days**: Since \( D = \frac{d}{2} \):
   \[
   D = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

8. **Speed on the other two days**: John runs 15 miles each day on the other two days. Since he runs for the same amount of time each day (let's call it \( t \) hours), his speed on these days is:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{15}{t}

polymath-low-es-41,"To determine the distance at which Polly can stand to safely launch the jabalina of gold and hit the dragon, we need to consider the increased range provided by the sapphire gemstone.

1. Polly's normal range without the sapphire gemstone is 400 feet.
2. With the sapphire gemstone, her range increases by three times.

First, we calculate the increased range:
\[
400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to ensure that this increased range is beyond the dragon's fire-breathing range of 1000 feet. Since 1200 feet is greater than 1000 feet, Polly can stand at a distance of 1200 feet from the dragon and still launch the jabalina safely.

1. Calculate the total number of notes Candice used at work.
2. Determine how many notes she had after buying the package.
3. Calculate the number of notes in the package by subtracting the initial number of notes and the remaining notes from the total notes she had after buying the package.

First, we know that Candice initially had 80 notes and used one note per each of the 220 tazas de café. So, the number of notes she used at work is 220. After using these notes, she had 23 notes left. Let's denote the number of notes in the package as \( x \).

The total number of notes she had after buying the package is the initial 80 notes plus the notes in the package, which is \( 80 + x \). After using 220 notes at work, she had 23 notes left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

First, let's break down the information given:
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
- John spends $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue ties.
Since each blue tie costs $40 and John spends $200 on blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Step 2: Calculate the number of red ties.
John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10

Let's denote the surface areas of the levels from top to bottom as follows:
- Level 1 (top level): \( A_1 = 16 \) square feet
- Level 2: \( A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \) square feet
- Level 3: \( A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) square feet

1. Calculate the total cost of the house and the repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

First, let's find the total cost of the house and the repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of repairs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. The problem states that the repairs increase the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value of the house (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. Therefore, the new value is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

3. Calculate the amount of food needed for the last meal based on the total daily requirement and the food already given.

First, we know that Wendi gives 15 tazas of food in the morning and 25 tazas in the afternoon. So, the total amount of food given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ tazas} \]

Since Wendi has 20 pollos and each pollo needs 3 tazas of food per day, the total amount of food needed for all the pollos in one day is:

First, calculate the cost of the second vaso:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost for the first 16 vasos. Since every second vaso is 60% of the original price, we can break down the calculation into the cost of the first vaso and the cost of the remaining 15 vasos, alternating between the two prices.

The cost for the first vaso is $5. The cost for the second vaso is $3. This pattern continues, so the costs for the first 16 vasos can be grouped as follows:

In the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes), he drives at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After the traffic and the 30-minute drive, he has:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
left to travel at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

mgsm-es-13,"To determine how many aspirators Melanie had initially, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. **Final Number of Aspirators:**
   Melanie has 5 aspirators left after selling some.

2. **Aspirators Sold at the Orange House:**
   Melanie sold half of what she had left at the orange house. Let \( x \) be the number of aspirators she had before selling to the orange house.
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 5 \implies x = 10
   \]
   So, Melanie had 10 aspirators before selling to the orange house.

3. **Aspirators Sold at the Red House:**
   Melanie sold 2 more aspirators than she sold at the green house. Let \( y \) be the number of aspirators she sold at the green house.
   \[
   \text{Aspirators sold at the red house} = y + 2
   \]
   After selling to the red house, she had 10 aspirators left. Therefore:
   \[
   10 - (y + 2) = 8 \implies y + 2 = 8 \implies y = 6
   \]
   So, Melanie sold 6 aspirators at the green house.

4. **Aspirators Sold at the Green House:**
   Melanie sold a third of her initial number of aspirators at the green house. Let \( z \) be the initial number of aspirators.
   \[
   \frac{z}{3} = 6 \implies z = 18
   \]

Thus, Melanie initially had \(\boxed{18}\) aspirators.",18,18

First, let's calculate the increase for the joyas:
- The initial value of the joyas is $5000.
- The expected increase is 2.5%.

The increase in value for the joyas is calculated as:
\[ 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \]

So, the new value of the joyas at the end of the month would be:
\[ 5000 + 125 = 5125 \]
The increase in value is $125.

Next, let's calculate the increase for the dispositivos electrónicos:
- The initial value of the dispositivos electrónicos is $8000.
- The expected increase is 1.2%.

The increase in value for the dispositivos electrónicos is calculated as:
\[ 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \]

So, the new value of the dispositivos electrónicos at the end of the month would be:
\[ 8000 + 96 = 8096 \]
The increase in value is $96.

Comparing the two increases, the joyas would yield a $125 increase, while the dispositivos electrónicos would yield a $96 increase. Therefore, the joyas would provide the highest increase in value.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- She earns $20 per hour for teaching.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from teaching are \(35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week}\).
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are \(50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$700/\text{week} = \$35,000\).

Next, let's calculate her earnings from training:
- Jill works 15 hours per week as a trainer.
- She earns $30 per hour for training.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from training are \(15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week}\).
- Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from training are \(50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$450/\text{week} = \$22,500\).

Now, we sum her annual earnings from both roles:

mgsm-es-19,"To determine the required speed for the remaining part of the journey, we first need to calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the 12-mile hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

Given that the total distance is 12 miles and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can solve for the total time:
\[
4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}

mgsm-es-24,"To determine the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means Kyle paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the milk:
\[ \text{Cost of milk} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the hands (assuming ""manazas"" means hands, and each hand costs $1.50):
\[ \text{Cost of hands} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the chicken, milk, and hands:
\[ \text{Total cost of chicken, milk, and hands} = 12.5 + 15 + 6 = 33.5 \]

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount left for the pizza is:
\[ \text{Amount left for pizza} = 50 - 33.5 = 16.5 \]

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find out how many boxes she could buy by dividing the remaining amount by the cost per box:
\[ \text{Number of boxes of pizza} = \frac{16.5}{8.50} = 1.94117647 \]

\[ x + 2x = \text{cost of the boots} - 5 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x = \text{cost of the boots} - 5 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of \( x \). The problem states that the first pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33. So, we substitute \( x = 33 \) into the equation:

\[ 3 \times 33 = \text{cost of the boots} - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 99 = \text{cost of the boots} - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

Let's denote the current age of Darrell as \(7x\) and the current age of Allen as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find the current age of Allen. Since Allen's age is \(11x\):

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

The problem asks for Allen's age in 10 years. Therefore, we add 10 to Allen's current age:

Next, we need to isolate \( S \). We do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins, we have:

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his Lego games. He has 13 Lego games and sells each for $15:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]
So, John gets $195 from selling his Lego games.

Next, we know that John buys 8 video games at $20 each:

So, John spends $160 on video games.

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. We can verify this by subtracting the amount spent on video games from the total money he had:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \]
Since John has $5 left, this means he must have given $30 to the seller and kept $5. This confirms the calculation is correct.

Now, we need to determine how many Lego games John sold. Since he sold all his Lego games and had $5 left, he must have sold all 13 Lego games. Therefore, the number of Lego games he has left is:

   On the first day, John runs 3 hours and covers half the distance of the other two days combined.

4. **Let \( x \) be the distance John runs on each of the other two days.**
   Therefore, the distance on the first day is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

5. **Total distance on the first day:**
   Since he runs 3 hours on the first day, let \( v \) be his speed. The distance covered on the first day is \( 3v \).

6. **Total distance on the other two days:**
   The distance covered on the other two days is \( 2x \).

7. **Equation for the total weekly distance:**
   \[
   3v + 2x = 60
   \]

8. **Relate the distances:**
   Since the distance on the first day is half the distance of the other two days combined:
   \[
   3v = \frac{x}{2}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 6v
   \]

9. **Substitute \( x \) in the total distance equation:**
   \[
   3v + 2(6v) = 60
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3v + 12v = 60
   \]
   \[
   15v = 60
   \]

10. **Solve for \( v \):**
    \[
    v = \frac{60}{15} = 4

mgsm-es-39,"To solve the problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can cover in six hours given the specified conditions.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can jump at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
   - Her jumping speed is half of her running speed.
   - Let \( R \) be her running speed.
   \[
   \frac{R}{2} = 3 \implies R = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - Let \( W \) be her walking speed.
   \[
   4W = 6 \implies W = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana runs for one-third of the time.
   - She walks for two-thirds of the time.
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance covered while running:**
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance covered while walking:**
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total distance covered:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can cover in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles.",18,18

mgsm-es-41,"To determine the distance at which Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the jabalina of gold, we need to calculate the effective range of the jabalina when Polly has the sapphire stone.

First, we know Polly can normally launch the jabalina to a distance of 400 feet. When she has the sapphire stone, she can launch it three times farther. Therefore, the effective range with the sapphire stone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire to a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly needs to stand at a distance greater than 1000 feet to be outside the dragon's reach. The maximum distance Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is 1200 feet.

Thus, the distance at which Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach and still hit it is:

So, the number of portions served to the guests is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26
mgsm-es-43,"To determine how many grams of the bag of potato chips you can consume given your daily calorie goal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories in the bag:**
   - Each portion has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 portions in the bag.
   \[
   \text{Total calories in the bag} = 250 \, \text{calories/portion} \times 5 \, \text{portions} = 1250 \, \text{calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining calories available for the day:**
   - Your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \, \text{calories} - 1800 \, \text{calories} = 200 \, \text{calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of portions you can consume:**
   - Each portion has 250 calories.
   \[
   \text{Number of portions you can consume} = \frac{200 \, \text{calories}}{250 \, \text{calories/portion}} = 0.8 \, \text{portions}
   \]

4. **Convert the number of portions to grams:**
   - There are 5 portions in the bag, and the bag weighs 300 grams.
   \[
   \text{Grams per portion} = \frac{300 \, \text{grams}}{5 \, \text{portions}} = 60 \, \text{grams/portion}
   \]
   - Therefore, 0.8 portions would be:
   \[
   \text{Grams you can consume} = 0.8 \, \text{portions} \times 60 \, \text{grams/portion} = 48 \, \text{grams}

Thus, you can consume $\boxed{48}$ grams of the bag of potato chips.",48,48
mgsm-es-44,"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pounds of cera de abeja needed to make 20 velas.
2. Determine the total cost of the cera de abeja and pabilos.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 velas.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

First, we know that Charlie can make 10 velas from 1 pound of cera de abeja. Therefore, to make 20 velas, he needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ velas}}{10 \text{ velas per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of cera de abeja} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cera de abeja and pabilos. Since one pound of cera de abeja and pabilos costs $10.00, the cost for 2 pounds is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 velas. If each vela is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ velas} \times \$2.00 \text{ per vela} = \$40.00 \]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

mgsm-es-109,"To determine the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any bonus.
2. Calculate the total bonus for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total bonus from the total cost of 10 gallons of gas.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any bonus.
The price per gallon is $3.00. Therefore, the cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total bonus for 10 gallons.
The bonus is $0.20 per gallon. Therefore, the bonus for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Subtract the total bonus from the total cost of 10 gallons of gas.

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 2 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 gallons of gas after the bonus is \(\boxed{28}\).",28,28
mgsm-es-110,"To determine the average number of rollitos de fruta that Marcel and Beatrice ate, we need to first calculate the total number of rollitos each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of rollitos that Beatrice ate. Beatrice was to 2 rollitos of ancho and 24 rollitos of largo. So, the total number of rollitos Beatrice ate is:
\[ 2 + 24 = 26 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of rollitos that Marcel ate. Marcel was to 3 rollitos of ancho and 14 rollitos of largo. So, the total number of rollitos Marcel ate is:
\[ 3 + 14 = 17 \]

Now, we need to find the average number of rollitos eaten by both Marcel and Beatrice. The average is calculated by adding the number of rollitos eaten by each and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{26 + 17}{2} = \frac{43}{2} = 21.5 \]

Therefore, the average number of rollitos eaten by Marcel and Beatrice is:

mgsm-es-111,"To determine how much water was in Julia's boat when she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rate of water entering the boat:**
   - Julia's boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows.
   - This can be expressed as a rate: \( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \).

2. **Determine the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore:**
   - Julia takes 64 seconds to reach the shore.
   - It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, the rate of rowing is \( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \).
   - The total distance to the shore is \( 64 \text{ seconds} \times 1.25 \text{ feet per second} = 80 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of water that enters the boat:**
   - Using the rate of water entry (0.2 liters per foot) and the total distance (80 feet):
   \[
   0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of water in the boat when Julia reaches the shore:**
   - Since the boat started with no water, the total amount of water that entered the boat is 16 liters.

Thus, the amount of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters.",16,16

1. **Determine the number of photographs the telephone of Brittany can store:**
   - Jamal's telephone can store 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's telephone can store 6 times more photographs than Brittany's telephone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's telephone can store is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in the photograph Jamal took:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's telephone can store is 50 times the number of birds in the photograph Jamal took.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in the photograph Jamal took.

mgsm-es-115,"To determine how much Sasha will earn from selling the leftover wood, we need to calculate the total cost of the wood she originally bought and then compare it to the selling price.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 tables:
- Sasha has 10 tables.
- Each table originally cost $10.

Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 tables:
\[ 10 \text{ tables} \times \$10/\text{table} = \$100 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 tables:
- Sasha has 5 tables.
- Each table originally cost $16.

Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 tables:
\[ 5 \text{ tables} \times \$16/\text{table} = \$80 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the wood:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Since the prices of the wood have increased by 50%, the new prices are:
- 2 x 4 x 10 tables: $10 \times 1.5 = \$15$ each
- 4 x 4 x 10 tables: $16 \times 1.5 = \$24$ each

Now, let's calculate the total selling price for the 2 x 4 x 10 tables:
\[ 10 \text{ tables} \times \$15/\text{table} = \$150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total selling price for the 4 x 4 x 10 tables:
\[ 5 \text{ tables} \times \$24/\text{table} = \$120 \]

Now, let's find the total selling price of all the wood:
\[ \$150 + \$120 = \$270 \]

Finally, let's determine how much Sasha will earn by subtracting the original cost from the total selling price:
\[ \$270 - \$180 = \$90 \]

Thus, Sasha will earn \(\boxed{90}\) dollars.",90,90
mgsm-es-116,"To determine the number of cucharaditas of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of ingredients used.

The ratio of cucharaditas of sugar to tazas of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts of the mixture are \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

Katy used a total of 120 cucharaditas of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts of the mixture are 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts:

\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

Now, since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, we can find the total amount of sugar used by multiplying the value of one part by 7:

2. Use the information about the total number of vehicles after the second day to find out how many vehicles were imported on the second day.
3. Determine the number of contenedors imported on the second day based on the number of vehicles imported.

First, we know that on the first day, there were 2 contenedors, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we know that after the second day, the total number of vehicles in the port is 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Since each contenedor contains 5 vehicles, the number of contenedors imported on the second day is:

mgsm-es-119,"Let's denote the salary of Lylah four years ago as \( L \). According to the problem, Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% more than Lylah's. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]

We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. So we can set up the equation:

\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23. Now, let's determine their salaries four years later. According to the problem, Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his salary four years ago. Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later is:

\[ A_{\text{new}} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Since the problem states that their salaries increased at the same rate, Lylah's salary four years later would also increase by 40% from her salary four years ago. Therefore, Lylah's salary four years later is:

\[ L_{\text{new}} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:

\[ A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

   Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}

mgsm-es-124,"Jennie started with 60 cartas that needed stamps. She stamped a third of these, which means she stamped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) cartas. After stamping these 20 cartas, the remaining 40 cartas that still needed stamps were added to the pile of cartas that already had stamps. 

Now, there are 30 cartas in the pile that already have stamps. Since the 40 cartas that needed stamps were added to the pile of cartas with stamps, the original number of cartas that already had stamps must be \( 30 - 40 = -10 \) (which is incorrect in this context, so we need to reframe it as the original number plus the 20 newly stamped ones equals 30).

So, if we let \( x \) be the original number of cartas that already had stamps, then \( x + 20 = 30 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 30 - 20 = 10 \).

polymath-low-es-84,"Let's denote the number of games won by the team as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be expressed as:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

polymath-low-es-99,"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many plant pots Mary will have left after giving some away.

1. **Initial number of plant pots:**
   - Mary already has 2 plant pots on each of the 40 window sills.
   - Therefore, the total number of plant pots she initially has is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pots/sill} \times 40 \text{ sills} = 80 \text{ pots}
     \]

2. **Number of plant pots given away:**
   - Mary plans to give 1 plant pot from each window sill to friends and family.
   - Since there are 40 window sills, the total number of plant pots she will give away is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pot/sill} \times 40 \text{ sills} = 40 \text{ pots}
     \]

3. **Number of plant pots remaining:**
   - To find out how many plant pots Mary will have left, we subtract the number of pots given away from the initial number of pots:
     \[
     80 \text{ pots} - 40 \text{ pots} = 40 \text{ pots}
     \]

4. **Additional plant pots received:**
   - Mary received 18 new plant pots from her favorite nursery.
   - Adding these to the remaining plant pots:
     \[
     40 \text{ pots} + 18 \text{ pots} = 58 \text{ pots}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of plant pots Mary will have left is:

1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell \(\frac{1}{4}\) more times than the first friend. This means the second friend rang the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend rang the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend rang the doorbell:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of times the timbre sounded is \(\boxed{175}\).",175,175

polymath-low-es-102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his daily water consumption and then sum it up for the week.

1. **Daily Water Consumption:**
   - John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.
   - Additionally, he drinks a glass of water before going to bed.
   - Therefore, each day, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekly Water Consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - If John drinks 4 glasses of water each day, then in a week he drinks \(4 \times 7 = 28\) glasses of water.

3. **Weekend Adjustments:**
   - On weekends, John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but he drinks a glass of soda instead of water before going to bed.
   - Therefore, on weekends, he drinks \(3\) glasses of water.

4. **Calculating the Total for the Week:**
   - For the 5 weekdays, John drinks \(4\) glasses of water each day.
     \[
     4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses}

1. **Determine the exterior dimensions of one box:**
   Each box has exterior dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.

2. **Calculate the interior dimensions of one box:**
   Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Length: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches

polymath-low-es-108,"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, Henry discarded 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). We know that after discarding the 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, we isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \( \boxed{50} \).",50,50

However, the problem does not specify an initial amount of water in the boat, so we will assume it starts empty.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia remaned in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to rem 20 feet, so we can calculate the number of 10-foot segments in 64 seconds:

\[

mgsm-es-141,"To determine the number of worker bees in the hive, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( R \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total number of bees is 700.
2. There are two times as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are two times as many baby bees as queen bees.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ W = 2B \]
\[ B = 2R \]
\[ W + B + R = 700 \]

First, substitute \( B = 2R \) into the equation \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2R) = 4R \]

Now we have \( W = 4R \) and \( B = 2R \). Substitute these into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4R + 2R + R = 700 \]
\[ 7R = 700 \]
\[ R = 100 \]

Now that we know \( R = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2R = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4R = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\).",400,400

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week.
2. Determine how much money Jordan would earn if he worked those hours at his job.

First, we know that Jordan spends 2 hours each day playing video games. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he spends playing video games in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we know that Jordan earns $10 per hour at his job. Therefore, if he worked 14 hours in a week, his earnings would be:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if he used the time he spends playing video games to work is:

mgsm-es-143,"First, let's identify the items that are not comestibles. In this case, the items that are not comestibles are the bombillas de luz (light bulbs) and the trampas para cucarachas (roach traps). 

The cost of the light bulbs is 3 dollars, and the cost of the roach traps is 4 dollars. The total cost of these items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the 10% tax on these items. The tax amount is:
\[ 7 \times 0.10 = 0.70 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the non-comestibles after tax is:
\[ 7 + 0.70 = 7.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the comestibles. The cost of the leche (milk) is 2 dollars, and the cost of the huevos (eggs) is 3 dollars. The total cost of these items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the comestibles to the cost of the non-comestibles after tax, we get:

Next, we calculate the cost for the supplies needed for each client. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 package of cleaning cloths. The cost for the bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost for the cleaning cloths is $5 per package. Therefore, the total cost per client is:
\[ 2 \times 2 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total cost for all clients is:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Kim's total income is $92 per week. To find the weekly profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples in the field.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest the pineapples in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we calculate the total number of pineapples in the field. John has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare has 100 pineapples. Therefore, the total number of pineapples is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many times John can harvest the pineapples in a year. Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year. Since each harvest yields 1000 pineapples and there are 4 harvests per year, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is \(\boxed{4000}\).",4000,4000

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Half of the 30 bees return.
   - Half of 30 is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
   - So, 15 bees return to the hive.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours leave again.
   - Twice 30 is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
   - So, 60 bees leave the hive.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - The bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return (30 - 15 = 15 bees) return to the hive.

mgsm-es-149,"To determine how many friends James has on Facebook, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of friends Dorothy has.
2. Use Dorothy's number of friends to find out how many friends James has.

First, we know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the equation for Dorothy's friends as follows:
\[ \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} = \frac{\text{Number of friends Charlie has}}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]
So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can calculate the number of friends James has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of friends James has} = 4 \times \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve lives 3 miles from the school. Since 1 mile = 5280 feet, Steve's distance is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- Tim lives 2 miles from the school. Therefore, Tim's distance is:
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach their homes:
- Steve travels at 440 feet per minute. The time it takes for Steve to reach his home is:
  \[
  \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}

mgsm-es-154,"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes over a semester, we need to break down the weekly schedule and then extend it to the entire semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. Therefore, the total number of hours for these days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours for these days is:

- Each panecillo is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the panecillos is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the length of the croissants with chocolate:
- Bill bakes 120 croissants with chocolate.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Now, let's calculate the length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[
1500 - 1423 = 77
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for buying clothes is \(\boxed{77}\).",77,77
mgsm-es-166,"To determine how many times Sandra's neighbor needs to watch her daughter to provide enough eggs for 15 flans, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 flans:**
   Each flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs required is:
   \[
   15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Determine how many eggs Sandra's neighbor provides each time:**
   Sandra's neighbor gives 9 eggs each time she watches the child.

3. **Calculate the number of times the neighbor needs to watch the child:**
   To find out how many times the neighbor needs to watch the child to provide 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs provided each time:
   \[
   \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/visit}} = 5 \text{ visits}
   \]

Thus, Sandra's neighbor needs to watch the child \(\boxed{5}\) times.",5,5
mgsm-es-167,"Let's define the variables first. Let \( S \) be Seth's current age and \( B \) be Brooke's current age. According to the problem, Seth has twice the age of Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In two years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( S \) with \( 2B \) in the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",16,16

3. Calculate the total miles walked during the weekdays.
4. Calculate the total miles walked during the weekend.
5. Sum the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend.

First, we know there are 7 days in a week. The weekdays are Monday through Friday, which is 5 days, and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday, which is 2 days.

On weekdays, Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, the total miles walked during the weekdays is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles walked during the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend to get the total miles walked in a week:

Next, we know that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

We also know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find the total age of the four aves. The ages are:
- Sally Four: 8 years old
- Granny Red: 16 years old

1. **Student Loans:**
   - Minimum payment: $300
   - Increased payment: $300 + 50% of $300 = $300 + $150 = $450

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200

First, let's calculate the time spent peeling one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting one potato:
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

### Peeling Time Calculation
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \( 1.5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \)

\[
1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes}

2. Calculate the amount spent on fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to the charity.
5. Subtract the weekly expenses for his daughter and his wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the rent:
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

Next, the amount spent on fuel:
\[ \text{Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after rent and fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining after rent and fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his charity:
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

Now, we subtract the donation from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid then gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife:
\[ \text{Remaining after giving to daughter and wife} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \]

3. Use Monic's number to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Bo's crabs} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Monic has 4 crabs less than Bo. So, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we know that Rani has 10 crabs more than Monic. So, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are:
  \[
  10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ dollars}

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the second week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He taught for 8 hours in the second week.
- Therefore, his earnings for the second week are:

1. **Determine the number of white carnations (claveles):**
   Sandra ordered 200 white carnations. According to the problem, the number of white carnations is five times the number of white carnations ordered. Let \( x \) be the number of white carnations ordered. Therefore:
   \[
   5x = 200
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{5} = 40

   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

2. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( y \) be the number of red roses ordered. Therefore:
   \[
   y = 4 \times 40 = 160

3. **Determine the number of red roses Fred needs to deliver:**
   Sandra is expecting 160 red roses, and Fred needs to deliver the remaining ones before 5 p. m. to avoid losing her business. Since the problem does not specify how many red roses Fred has already delivered, we assume he has not delivered any yet. Therefore, Fred needs to deliver all 160 red roses.

From the first statement, ""Jean is two years older than Mark,"" we can write the equation:
\[ J = M + 2 \]

From the second statement, ""Hace dos años, Mark era 5 años mayor que la mitad de la edad de Jan,"" we need to translate this into an equation. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \) and Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \). The statement says that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So we can write:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now that we know Mark's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:

mgsm-es-184,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them. The first event is rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, and the second event is rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Step 3: Compare the probabilities
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25. To find out how much more probable the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the difference in probabilities:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more probable than rolling two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:

2. Determine the number of rats per cage.

First, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw and the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is 160. Therefore, the number of rats can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of rats} = \frac{160 \text{ pieces of straw}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = \frac{160}{6} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67

Let's break down the process:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- After using these pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
- He can use these 25 empty pens to make 5 new pens (since 25 divided by 5 is 5).

So, after making the new pens, Ram will have:
- The 5 new pens he just made.
- The 20 pens that were not used to make the new pens (since 25 - 5 = 20).

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram ends up with is:

First, let's calculate the daily cost of makeup:
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
\[ \text{Daily cost} = 250 \times 6 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Martes:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies eaten by Sue:**
\[ 20 \text{ (Lunes)} + 26 \text{ (Martes)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

**Total cookies eaten by her sister:**
\[ 5 \text{ (Lunes)} + 13 \text{ (Martes)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we convert the total number of cookies into calories. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:

**Calories consumed by Sue:**
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

**Calories consumed by her sister:**
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

First, let's find the total cost of the house and the repairs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of repairs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. The problem states that the repairs increase the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value of the house (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. So, the new value of the house is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

   - At a rate of 2 GB per minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time lost due to the forced restart:**
   - The forced restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB per minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = time to download 40% + time lost due to restart + time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time Carla spends downloading the file is $\boxed{120}$ minutes.",120,160
polymath-low-es-8,"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled in the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the distance John covers during his return trip. He spends 2 hours in traffic and then drives for an additional 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance in traffic} = 0 \, \text{miles} \, (\text{since he is not moving)} \]
\[ \text{Distance at 30 mph} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After these 2.5 hours, he has 1.5 hours left to cover the remaining distance at 80 mph. Let's calculate the distance he covers in these 1.5 hours:
\[ \text{Distance at 80 mph} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances to find the total distance John has traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 315 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John initially traveled 180 miles away from his house, we need to find the net distance from his house after the return trip:
\[ \text{Net distance} = 315 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the final distance from the house at the end of 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]",135,45
polymath-low-es-9,"To determine how much Eliza earns this week, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked.

1. **Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:**
   - Regular pay rate: $10 per hour
   - Hours worked at regular rate: 40 hours
   \[
   \text{Regular pay} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400

polymath-low-es-12,"To determine how many years it will take Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the total costs and the total revenue over time.

1. **Initial Cost**: Planting the lemon tree costs $90.
2. **Annual Costs**: Each year, the cost to water and fertilize the tree is $3.
3. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Let's denote the number of years by \(n\).

The total cost after \(n\) years is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90 + 3n \]

The total revenue after \(n\) years is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10.5n \]

To find out when Carlos starts making a profit, we need to find the smallest \(n\) such that the total revenue is greater than the total cost:
\[ 10.5n > 90 + 3n \]

Subtract \(3n\) from both sides:
\[ 7.5n > 90 \]

Divide both sides by 7.5:
\[ n > \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, \(n = 13\).

So, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{13}\) years to start making a profit from his lemon tree.",13,13

   Melanie sold \(\frac{1}{3}\) of her aspirators at the Green House. Therefore, the number of aspirators sold at the Green House is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   The number of aspirators remaining after the Green House sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}

First, let's calculate the increase for the joyas:
- The initial value of the joyas is $5000.
- The expected increase is 2.5%.

The increase in value for the joyas is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value for joyas} = 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \]

So, the total value of the joyas at the end of the month would be:
\[ 5000 + 125 = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the increase for the dispositivos electrónicos:
- The initial value of the dispositivos electrónicos is $8000.
- The expected increase is 1.2%.

The increase in value for the dispositivos electrónicos is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Increase in value for dispositivos electrónicos} = 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \]

So, the total value of the dispositivos electrónicos at the end of the month would be:
\[ 8000 + 96 = 8096 \]

Now, we compare the increases:
- The increase in value for the joyas is $125.
- The increase in value for the dispositivos electrónicos is $96.

Since $125 > $96, the joyas will yield a higher increase in value. Therefore, the maximum increase in value is $125.

\[ x + 2x = \text{cost of the boots} - 5 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = \text{cost of the boots} - 5 \]

We also know that the first pair of high-heeled shoes costs $33, so \( x = 33 \). Substituting \( x = 33 \) into the equation, we get:

This simplifies to:

\[ 99 = \text{cost of the boots} - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 99 + 5 = \text{cost of the boots} \]

\[ 104 = \text{cost of the boots} \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104
polymath-low-es-30,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age, and then find Allen's age in 10 years.

1. Let's denote Darrell's current age by \( D \) and Allen's current age by \( A \).
2. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is \( 7:11 \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11}A
   \]

3. We are also given that the sum of their current ages is 162:
   \[
   D + A = 162
   \]

4. Substitute \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162
   \]

5. Combine the terms on the left-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{7}{11}A + \frac{11}{11}A = 162
   \]
   \[
   \frac{18}{11}A = 162
   \]

6. Solve for \( A \) by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{11}{18} \):
   \[
   A = 162 \times \frac{11}{18}
   \]
   \[
   A = 162 \times \frac{11}{18} = 9 \times 11 = 99
   \]

7. Now that we have Allen's current age, we can find Darrell's current age using \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \):
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11} \times 99 = 7 \times 9 = 63
   \]

8. Finally, we need to find Allen's age in 10 years:
   \[
   A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-es-31,"To find the average number of gummies Gunter's friends think are in the jar, we first need to determine the number each friend thinks is in the jar. Let's denote the first friend's guess as \(80\).

1. The second friend's guess is \(20\) more than half of the first friend's guess. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

2. The third friend's guess is \(25\%\) more than the first friend's guess. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the three guesses: \(80\), \(60\), and \(100\). To find the average, we sum these numbers and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average number of gummies Gunter's friends think are in the jar is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
