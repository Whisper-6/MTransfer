mgsm-ja-47,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount John spent on neckties. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue neckties John bought:**
   John spent $200 on blue neckties, and each blue necktie costs $40. Therefore, the number of blue neckties he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]
   So, John bought 5 blue neckties.

2. **Determine the number of red neckties John bought:**
   John bought twice as many red neckties as blue neckties. Therefore, the number of red neckties he bought is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, John bought 10 red neckties.

3. **Determine the price of each red necktie:**
   The red neckties are 50% more expensive than the blue neckties. Since each blue necktie costs $40, the price of each red necktie is:
   \[
   40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
   So, each red necktie costs $60.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red neckties:**
   John bought 10 red neckties, and each costs $60. Therefore, the total amount spent on red neckties is:
   \[
   10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all neckties:**
   The total amount spent on all neckties is the sum of the amount spent on blue neckties and the amount spent on red neckties:
   \[
   200 + 600 = 800
   \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on neckties is \(\boxed{800}\).",800,800

mgsm-ja-50,"To determine how much Lloyd can earn from his eggs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs produced in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens, since the eggs are sold by the dozen. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens of eggs produced in a week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozen} \]

Since the eggs are sold at $2 per dozen, the total revenue from selling the eggs in a week is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Lloyd can earn from his eggs in a week is:

mgsm-ja-53,"To determine which day the mechanic earned more and by how much, we need to calculate the earnings for both days.

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings on Thursday.**
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- The cost to repair each truck tire is $60.
- The cost to repair each car tire is $40.

First, calculate the earnings from truck tires:
\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from car tires:
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160 \]

Now, add the earnings from both types of tires:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

So, the mechanic earned $520 on Thursday.

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings on Friday.**
- The mechanic repaired 12 tires in total but did not repair any truck tires.
- Therefore, all 12 tires were car tires.

Calculate the earnings from the 12 car tires:
\[ 12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480 \]

So, the mechanic earned $480 on Friday.

**Step 3: Compare the earnings of both days.**
- Earnings on Thursday: $520
- Earnings on Friday: $480

Determine the difference in earnings:

mgsm-ja-64,"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total capacity of the gas tank.
2. Calculate the number of miles driven per gallon of gas.
3. Use the number of miles per gallon to find out how many miles can be driven on a full tank.

First, we know from the problem that the gas tank can hold 12 gallons of gas and that Sophia needs to add 4 gallons to refill the tank after driving 100 miles. This means that the gas tank was 8 gallons full before she added the 4 gallons to refill it. Therefore, the total capacity of the gas tank is:
\[ 8 \text{ gallons} + 4 \text{ gallons} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles per gallon her car gets. Since she drove 100 miles using 8 gallons of gas, the miles per gallon (mpg) is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{8 \text{ gallons}} = 12.5 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

   - Total amount of dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Convert the total amount of dog food into bags:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \).

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{180}{110} \approx 1.636 \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will need for the first year is $\boxed{2}$.",2,5

mgsm-ja-78,"To determine which package is more cost-effective and how much more cost-effective it is to buy 18 flowers, we need to calculate the total cost for both package options and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the cost for the 3-pack option:
- Each 3-pack costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, we need 18 / 3 = 6 packs.
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers using the 3-pack option is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the 2-pack option:
- Each 2-pack costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, we need 18 / 2 = 9 packs.
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers using the 2-pack option is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two total costs:
- The cost using the 3-pack option is $15.00.
- The cost using the 2-pack option is $9.00.
- The difference in cost is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Thus, buying 18 flowers using the 2-pack option is $6.00 more cost-effective. The final answer is:

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost.

We can express these conditions with the following equations:
\[ W + L + T = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Since the problem does not mention any ties, we can assume \( T = 0 \). Therefore, the first equation simplifies to:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now, substitute \( W = L + 8 \) into the equation \( W + L = 22 \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

   - Since \( x \) can vary, we need to ensure the total is consistent. Given the problem constraints, we can assume the distribution is such that the total is consistent with the given rates.

8. **Final calculation:**
   - The total earnings can be calculated by considering the fixed rates and the total number of sentences:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 5x + 10(1000 - x) = 5x + 10000 - 10x = 10000 - 5x
   \]
   - Since the problem does not provide additional constraints, we can assume the distribution is such that the total is consistent with the given rates. Therefore, the total earnings are:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 5x + 10(1000 - x) = 5x + 10000 - 10x = 10000 - 5x
   \]

Thus, Mark earns a total of \(\boxed{5000}\) cents per week.",5000,7500

1. Calculate the amount of water Balder gets in the morning:
   - Balder gets 5 buckets of water in the morning.
   - Each bucket contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in the morning is \(5 \text{ buckets} \times 5 \text{ liters/bucket} = 25 \text{ liters}\).

2. Calculate the amount of water Balder gets in the afternoon:
   - Balder gets 6 buckets of water in the afternoon.
   - Each bucket contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the amount of water in the afternoon is \(6 \text{ buckets} \times 5 \text{ liters/bucket} = 30 \text{ liters}\).

3. Calculate the total amount of water Balder gets each day:
   - The total amount of water is the sum of the morning and afternoon amounts.
   - Therefore, the total amount of water is \(25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

So, Balder gets \(\boxed{55}\) liters of water each day.",55,55

1. **One-time prize**: The prize is $5,000.

2. **Increased salary**: John's original weekly salary is $2,000. With a 5% raise, his new weekly salary is:
   \[
   2000 \times 1.05 = 2100 \text{ dollars}

mgsm-ja-203,"To determine the total amount of cheese used by Karl in the week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the cheese usage for each part.

1. **Cheese used in sandwiches:**
   - Karl eats a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used in sandwiches is:
     \[
     7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used in omelets:**
   - Karl eats an omelet for breakfast on 3 days.
   - Each omelet uses 1 slice more cheese than a sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used in omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used in macaroni and cheese:**
   - Karl eats macaroni and cheese for dinner on some days.
   - Each serving of macaroni and cheese uses 8 slices of cheese.
   - We need to determine how many days he ate macaroni and cheese. However, the problem does not specify the exact number of days. Let's denote the number of days he ate macaroni and cheese as \(d\).
   - Therefore, the total cheese used in macaroni and cheese is:
     \[
     d \times 8 \text{ slices/day}
     \]

4. **Total cheese used:**
   - The total cheese used is the sum of the cheese used in sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used is:
     \[
     14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8d \text{ slices}
     \]
   - Since the number of days \(d\) for macaroni and cheese is not specified, we cannot determine the exact total without this information. However, if we assume \(d = 1\) (as a possible scenario), then:
     \[
     14 + 9 + 8 \times 1 = 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 \text{ slices}

- 20ダース (20 dozen) of cups are being sold for $1200.
- This is $1200 less than the total price of half a dozen (半ダース) of plates.

To find the price of half a dozen plates, we add $1200 to the price of 20 dozen cups:

\[ \text{Price of half a dozen plates} = \$1200 + \$1200 = \$2400 \]

Now, we need to find the price of one cup. Since 20 dozen cups are being sold for $1200, we can calculate the price of one cup as follows:

\[ \text{Price of one cup} = \frac{\$1200}{20 \times 12} = \frac{\$1200}{240} = \$5 \]

Therefore, the total amount to purchase one cup is $5.

The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of the boots is $20 per pair. Since she needs 2 pairs of boots, the total cost for the boots is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the jacket and the boots, the total cost is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara already has and how much more she needs to earn. Sara has already saved $10, and she earns $5 for each child she watches. Additionally, her parents give her $4 for each time she mows the lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \( x \). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn \( x \) times and watching children 4 times is:
\[ 10 + 5 \times 4 + 4 \times x = 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least $70:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4x = 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times to afford the jacket and the boots.",10,10

3. The total number of eggs laid per day is 42.
4. The number of white chickens is 2 more than the number of red chickens, i.e., \( w = r + 2 \).

We can set up the following equation based on the total number of eggs:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

We need to find out how many customers came on the third day. Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \( x \).

The total number of customers over the three days can be expressed as:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

mgsm-ja-214,"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the large pool as \( L \) gallons and in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:

\[ L - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ L - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ L - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ L = 2S - 16 \]

Now, 4 minutes later, the large pool has 4 times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:

\[ L - 4 \times 4 = 4(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ L - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]
\[ L - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ L = 4S - 48 \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( L = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( L = 4S - 48 \)

We can set these two expressions for \( L \) equal to each other:

\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 48 \]
\[ 48 - 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 32 = 2S \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, the small pool currently has \( S - 4 \times 4 = 16 - 16 = 0 \) gallons of water. However, we need to find the amount of water in the small pool now, which is:

\[ S - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0 \]

But since the problem states that the small pool now has 16 gallons of water, we can recheck the equations and the logical steps. The correct interpretation is that the small pool now has 16 gallons of water. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

3. **Monthly Payment**: $165

First, let's calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:
\[ \text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1,980 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total interest accrued over the 12 months. The interest is 10% of the initial loan amount:

The total amount to be repaid, including the principal and the interest, is:
\[ \text{Total Repayment} = 2,000 + 200 = 2,200 \]

Since the total amount paid over 12 months is $1,980, the remaining debt is:

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian is 3 times the age of Harriet. Therefore, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3:

- Water-type cards: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we need to adjust for the changes:

- James loses 8 Water-type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 Water-type cards
- James buys 14 Grass-type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 Grass-type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:

Total new cards = 30 (Flame) + 34 (Grass) + 32 (Water) = 96

The probability of randomly selecting a Water-type card from the new total is the number of Water-type cards divided by the total number of cards:

Probability = 32 / 96 = 1 / 3 ≈ 0.3333

Rounded to one decimal place, the probability is 0.3.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected card is a Water-type card is $\\boxed{0.3}$.",3,33

mgsm-ja-228,"To determine how long it will take for Karinda and her mother to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of solving the puzzle and then find out how long it will take them to complete it.

First, let's find out how many pieces Karinda can place per minute. According to the problem, Karinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

Next, we need to determine how many pieces her mother can place per minute. The problem states that her mother can place half the number of pieces that Karinda can, so her mother can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Now, we can find their combined rate by adding the number of pieces they can place per minute together. Karinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute and her mother's rate is 2 pieces per minute, so their combined rate is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

To find out how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes to complete the puzzle is 1 hour. Therefore, the answer is:

1. **Initial number of small watermelons:**
   - The farm initially has 120 small watermelons.

2. **After 2 months:**
   - 30% of the watermelons are now harvestable.
   - Number of harvestable watermelons after 2 months: \( 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \)
   - Number of watermelons that are not yet harvestable: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \)

3. **After 2 more weeks (4 weeks total):**
   - 4/5 (or 80%) of the remaining watermelons are now harvestable.
   - Number of harvestable watermelons after 4 weeks: \( 84 \times \frac{4}{5} = 84 \times 0.80 = 67.2 \)
   - Since the number of watermelons must be a whole number, we round 67.2 to 67 (assuming partial watermelons are not counted).
   - Number of watermelons that are not yet harvestable: \( 84 - 67 = 17 \)

Thus, the number of watermelons that still need to be harvested is \( \boxed{17} \).",17,21

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. The number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

1. Calculate the distance John runs each day.
2. Sum the total distance he runs in a week.
3. Determine the total time he spends running in a week.
4. Calculate his speed using the total distance and total time.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance John runs each day.**

- On the first day, John runs 3 hours. Since the total weekly distance is 60 miles and he runs 3 days a week, the distance he runs on the first day is:
  \[
  \text{Distance on the first day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles}
  \]
- On the other two days, he runs half the distance he runs on the first day. So, the distance he runs on each of these two days is:
  \[
  \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{2} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

**Step 2: Sum the total distance he runs in a week.**

- The total distance John runs in a week is:
  \[
  20 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles}
  \]

**Step 3: Determine the total time he spends running in a week.**

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On each of the other two days, he runs for:
  \[
  \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
  \]
- So, the total time he spends running in a week is:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 5 \text{ hours}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate his speed using the total distance and total time.**

- Speed is calculated as distance divided by time:

   - Time spent running: \( \frac{3}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance covered in each activity:**
   - Distance covered while skipping: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance covered while running: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 9 \text{ miles per hour} = 18 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance covered while walking: \( 4 \text{ hours} \times 2.25 \text{ miles per hour} = 9 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Calculate the total distance covered:**

polymath-low-ja-49,"To determine the number of unoccupied rooms in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rooms in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied rooms.
3. Subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total number of rooms to find the number of unoccupied rooms.

First, we calculate the total number of rooms in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 rooms. Therefore, the total number of rooms is:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these rooms are occupied. We know that \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied rooms is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Now, we subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total number of rooms to find the number of unoccupied rooms:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

polymath-low-ja-50,"To determine how much Lloyd can earn from his eggs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced in a week.
2. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced in a week.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings based on the price per dozen.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs produced in a week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs produced in a week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens} \]

Lloyd sells the eggs at $2 per dozen, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd can earn $\boxed{294}$ dollars in a week.",294,294

1. Identify the initial pension amount and the rate of increase.
2. Calculate the number of years after which the pension starts increasing.
3. Determine the number of years after which the pension will have increased.
4. Calculate the increased pension amount.

Given:
- Initial pension amount after 40 years of service: $50,000 per year.
- Pension increases by 5% per year starting 20 years after the start of service.
- Marcy stops working after 30 years.

First, we need to find out how many years the pension has increased by the time Marcy stops working. Since Marcy stops working after 30 years, the pension has increased for \(30 - 20 = 10\) years.

The formula to calculate the future value of a pension with a fixed annual increase is:
\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $50,000, the rate is 5% (or 0.05), and the number of years is 10.

So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Future Value} = 50000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{10} \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 50000 \times (1.05)^{10} \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 50000 \times 1.628894626777442 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} \approx 81444.73 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the pension amount after 30 years is approximately $81,445.

polymath-low-ja-78,"To determine which package is more cost-effective for buying 18 flowers, we need to calculate the total cost for both package options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for the 3-pack option:
- Each 3-pack costs $2.50.
- To find out how many 3-packs are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, we need 6 packs of 3 flowers each.
- The total cost for 6 packs is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the 2-pack option:
- Each 2-pack costs $1.
- To find out how many 2-packs are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, we need 9 packs of 2 flowers each.
- The total cost for 9 packs is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the total costs of both options:
- The cost for the 3-pack option is $15.00.
- The cost for the 2-pack option is $9.00.

To find out how much more cost-effective the 2-pack option is, we subtract the cost of the 2-pack option from the cost of the 3-pack option:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Thus, buying 18 flowers using the 2-pack option is $6.00 more cost-effective.

\[
\boxed{6.00}

mgsm-ja-2,"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs.
2. Determine the new price of the house after the price increase.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new price.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs.**

The cost of the house is $80,000 and the cost of repairs is $50,000. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new price of the house after the price increase.**

The price of the house increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the new price is 250% of the original purchase price (100% original price + 150% increase). Therefore, the new price is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new price minus the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Thus, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

mgsm-ja-8,"First, let's calculate the distance John initially traveled before realizing he forgot something important at home. He was driving at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, so the distance is:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the distance John covers in the 4 hours total, considering the conditions given:

1. **First 2 hours of the 4-hour period:** John is stuck in traffic and makes no progress.
2. **Next 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 30 miles per hour:**

\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

3. **Remaining 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour:**

\[ 80 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Now, summing up the distances covered in the 4-hour period:

\[ 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles} \]

Since John initially drove 180 miles and then traveled an additional 135 miles, the total distance he has covered in 4 hours is:

\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 135 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

However, we need to find out how far he is from his starting point (home) after 4 hours. Since he initially traveled 180 miles away from home and then traveled 135 miles back towards home, the net distance from home is:

\[ 180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, after 4 hours, John is 45 miles away from his home.

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 he has left equals the total amount of money he had initially. We can verify this by subtracting the amount spent on video games from the initial amount:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John has $5 left, we can confirm that the calculation is correct because:

\[ 35 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

1. Determine the total number of post-it notes Candice had before she bought more.
2. Subtract the number of post-it notes she used and the number she had left from the initial amount plus the amount she bought.

First, we know Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes and had 23 left after buying more. Let's denote the number of post-it notes she bought as \( x \).

The total number of post-it notes she had after buying more is the sum of the initial amount and the amount she bought:
\[ 80 + x \]

The total number of post-it notes she used is 220, and she had 23 left, so the total number of post-it notes she had after buying more is:

mgsm-ja-94,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The problem states that there are 60 dogs.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   The problem also states that there are 2 cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of dogs and cats:**
   Adding the number of dogs and cats together, we get:
   \[
   60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The problem states that the number of rabbits is 12 fewer than the total number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together, we get:
   \[
   60 + 120 + 168 = 348

1. Determine the number of boys in the class.
2. Determine the number of girls in the class.
3. Determine how many of the girls are in the Girl Scouts.
4. Determine how many girls are not in the Girl Scouts.

First, we calculate the number of boys. Since 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we have:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]
This means the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]
Next, we calculate how many of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, we have:
\[
\text{Number of girls in Girl Scouts} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]
Therefore, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in Girl Scouts} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]
So, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts is \(\boxed{40}\).",40,40

1. Identify how many hours Harry slept.
2. Calculate how many hours James slept.
3. Find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.

First, we know that Harry slept for 9 hours.

Next, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time Harry slept. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]
So, James slept for 6 hours.

Now, we find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept:

mgsm-ja-97,"To determine how many tomatoes Freida used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the reduction in volume**: The volume of the tomato sauce is reduced to half when using canned tomatoes. This means that if the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, the original volume of the tomatoes used before reduction would be twice that amount.

2. **Calculate the original volume of tomatoes**: 
   \[
   \text{Original volume} = 2 \times 32 \text{ ounces} = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cans needed**: Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}

mgsm-ja-98,"Initially, there were 30 cars on the highway. Out of these, some cars left the congestion at different times. Specifically, 5 cars left during the first 15 minutes of congestion, and 20 cars left during the remaining 15 minutes. 

To find out how many cars were part of the first 15 minutes of congestion, we need to consider the following:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars.
2. 5 cars left during the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 cars left during the remaining 15 minutes.

The total number of cars that left the congestion is \(5 + 20 = 25\).

Therefore, the number of cars that remained in the congestion for the entire 30 minutes is \(30 - 25 = 5\).

However, we are asked specifically about the number of cars that were part of the first 15 minutes of congestion. Since 5 cars left during the first 15 minutes, the number of cars that stayed in the first 15 minutes is the initial number of cars minus those that left during the first 15 minutes and those that left during the second 15 minutes.

The number of cars that stayed in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of cars that were part of the first 15 minutes of congestion is \(\boxed{10}\).",10,5
mgsm-ja-99,"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mary received 18 new potted plants yesterday.
- She already had 40 window sills, each with 2 potted plants, making a total of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) potted plants.
- She plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window sills to friends and family.

Now, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary initially had:

\[ 80 \text{ (initial plants)} + 18 \text{ (new plants)} = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the 1 potted plant she will give away from each of the 40 window sills:

\[ 40 \text{ (window sills)} \times 1 \text{ (plant per window sill)} = 40 \text{ plants to give away} \]

Subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ (total plants)} - 40 \text{ (plants to give away)} = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will have left is \( \boxed{58} \).",58,58

mgsm-ja-102,"To determine how many times more water John drinks on weekdays compared to weekends, we need to calculate the total amount of water he drinks on both weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the amount of water John drinks on a weekday:
- He drinks 1 cup of water with breakfast.
- He drinks 1 cup of water with lunch.
- He drinks 1 cup of water with dinner.
- He drinks 1 cup of water before going to bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ cups of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total amount of water he drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- He drinks 1 cup of water with breakfast.
- He drinks 1 cup of water with lunch.
- Instead of water, he drinks 1 cup of soda with dinner.
- He drinks 1 cup of water before going to bed.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 \text{ cups of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total amount of water he drinks on weekends is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times more water John drinks on weekdays compared to weekends:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ cups}}{6 \text{ cups}} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

So, John drinks approximately 3.33 times more water on weekdays compared to weekends. The final answer is:

2. Use this rate to calculate the total time for the fog to cover the entire town.

From the problem, we know that the fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it takes to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

First, let's calculate how many pieces Poppy has placed:
- Poppy has placed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 1000 pieces.
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}

\]

Now, we add the pieces placed by Poppy and her mother to find the total number of pieces that have been placed:
\[
250 + 750 = 1000 \text{ pieces}

mgsm-ja-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total time he spent watching TV throughout the week and subtract the time spent watching episodes on other days.

First, let's summarize the time spent watching TV on each day:
- Monday: 1 hour (60 minutes)
- Tuesday: 1 hour (60 minutes)
- Wednesday: \( x \) 30-minute episodes
- Thursday: 1 hour (60 minutes) + 30 minutes (0.5 hours) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours (120 minutes)

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours, which is 420 minutes.

Now, let's set up the equation to find \( x \):

\[
60 + 60 + 0.5x + 60 + 120 = 420
\]

Combine the known values:

\[
240 + 0.5x = 420
\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 180
\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = 360
\]

Since \( x \) represents the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to convert 360 minutes into episodes:

\[
x = \frac{360}{30} = 12

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry planned to bake \( 50 \) cookies, and since he planned to bake twice the number he baked last year, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

mgsm-ja-111,"To determine how much water entered the boat, we need to calculate the total distance Julia had to row and then use that to find the total amount of water that leaked into the boat.

1. Identify the distance to the shore: The problem states that the shore is 64 seconds away. However, the speed at which Julia rows is not given directly. Instead, we know that for every 10 feet she rows, 2 liters of water leak into the boat.

2. Determine the total distance rowed: Since the problem does not specify her rowing speed in feet per second, we can infer that the distance to the shore is directly proportional to the amount of water that leaks. If 10 feet of rowing results in 2 liters of water leaking, we need to find out how much water leaks for 64 seconds of rowing.

3. Calculate the total amount of water leaked: Since the problem does not specify the exact distance per second, we can use the ratio directly. If 10 feet results in 2 liters, then we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 64 seconds. However, since the problem is asking for the total water leaked and not the exact distance, we can use the ratio directly.

The total amount of water leaked is:
\[ \text{Total water leaked} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{10 \text{ feet/2 liters}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 64 \times \frac{2}{10} = 64 \times 0.2 = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

- Sasha bought 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each. She has 10 of these boards.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100

- Sasha also bought 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each. She has 5 of these boards.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost is the sum of the costs of both types of boards:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the wood:
- The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 50% higher than the original price of $10. Therefore, the new price is:
  \[
  \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15
  \]
- The revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 50% higher than the original price of $16. Therefore, the new price is:

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90

3. Subtract the number of vehicles checked on the first day from the total number of vehicles to find the number of vehicles checked on the second day.
4. Divide the number of vehicles checked on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day.

Let's start with the first step:

1. On the first day, the tax officers checked 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, the number of vehicles checked on the first day is:

5. Sum their salaries after 4 years.

First, we know that Adrian's initial salary is $40,000. According to the problem, his salary after 4 years is 40% higher than his initial salary. So, we calculate his salary after 4 years as follows:

\[
40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000

So, Adrian's salary after 4 years is $56,000.

Next, we need to find Lilia's initial salary. The problem states that Adrian's initial salary is 30% higher than Lilia's initial salary. Let's denote Lilia's initial salary by \( L \). Then we have:

\[
40000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30

   - Total letters: 60
   - Letters that need stamps: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 60
   - Letters that already have stamps: \( 60 - \text{Letters that need stamps} \)

2. **Calculate the number of letters that need stamps:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 letters need stamps.

3. **Determine the number of letters that already have stamps:**
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 letters already have stamps.

4. **Verify the current number of letters with stamps:**
   - Current letters with stamps: 30
   - Letters that need stamps: 20
   - Since 30 letters currently have stamps and only 20 need stamps, this means 10 letters that already had stamps are counted in the 30.

5. **Calculate the original number of letters with stamps:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original number of letters with stamps.
   - The number of letters that need stamps is 20, and the current number of letters with stamps is 30.
   - Therefore, the original number of letters with stamps is:

Let's denote the number of spoons Julia initially had as \( x \).

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - Julia had \( x \) spoons initially.
   - Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she had \( x + 5 \) spoons.
   - She used 3 spoons, so she had \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \) spoons left.
   - After setting the table, there were 12 spoons, so \( x + 2 = 12 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 2 = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 12 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 10

polymath-low-ja-86,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Alarm**: The first alarm rings once.
2. **Second Alarm**: The second alarm rings 3 times as long as the first alarm. Since the first alarm rang once, the second alarm rings 3 times.
3. **Third Alarm**: The third alarm rings half as long as the second alarm. Since the second alarm rang 3 times, the third alarm rings \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) times. Since the number of times an alarm rings must be a whole number, and the problem implies it rings a whole number of times, we can assume it rings 1.5 times, which we will consider as 1.5 for calculation purposes, but in terms of counting, it counts as 1.5.

Now, let's sum up the total number of times the alarm rings:
- First alarm: 1 time
- Second alarm: 3 times
- Third alarm: 1.5 times

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 1 + 3 + 1.5 = 5.5 \]

Since the problem asks for the total number of times the alarm rings, and considering the context of the problem, we can assume it is asking for the total number of rings, which is 5.5, but typically in such problems, we consider the whole number part, so the answer is:
\[ \boxed{5.5} \]",5,22

1. **Initial Salary:**
   Silvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary after 1 year (6th year):**
   The salary increases by 10%.
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]
   Annual Salary = $660 \times 12 = 7920 \text{ dollars}

3. **Salary after 2 years (7th year):**
   The salary increases by another 10%.
   \[

This simplifies to:

\[ 11x = 88,000 \]

To find the number of guests expected to attend:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags required. Since each guest who attends needs 0.75 gift bags, we multiply the number of guests expected to attend by 0.75:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost of the gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the total number of gift bags by the cost per bag:

Therefore, for 5 child dinosaurs, the total amount of potato salad is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad for the adult and child dinosaurs to find the total amount needed:
\[ 200 + 25 = 225 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic.",225,225

4. Subtract the number of girls in Girl Scouts from the total number of girls to find the number of girls who are not in Girl Scouts.

Let's start with step 1. The total number of students is 200, and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Next, step 2. The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

- He drinks 1 cup of water in the morning.
- He drinks 1 cup of water at noon.
- He drinks 1 cup of water at dinner.
- He drinks 1 cup of water before bed.

So, on a typical day, John drinks:

Next, let's calculate his water consumption on a weekend day (Saturday and Sunday):
- He drinks 1 cup of water in the morning.
- He drinks 1 cup of water at noon.
- Instead of 1 cup of water at dinner, he drinks 1 cup of soda.
- He drinks 1 cup of water before bed.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:

First, we know there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 classes in a day. Therefore, the total number of classes in a day is:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ classes/teacher} = 8 \text{ classes} \]

Next, since the whiteboard is used once per class, the whiteboard is used 8 times in a day. Given that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times for each use, the total number of cleanings in a day is:
\[ 8 \text{ uses} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/use} = 24 \text{ cleanings} \]

Thus, the whiteboard is cleaned \(\boxed{24}\) times in a day.",24,24

polymath-low-ja-116,"To determine how much sugar Keiti used, we need to understand the ratio of sugar to water and then apply it to the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts of the mixture are \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 cups. Since the ratio tells us that the total parts are 20, we can find out how much each part is by dividing the total amount by the total number of parts:
\[
\text{Amount per part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ cups}
\]

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, we can find the total amount of sugar by multiplying the amount per part by 7:
\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ cups}

1. Calculate the number of containers checked on the first day.
2. Determine the total number of containers after the second day.
3. Subtract the number of containers checked on the first day from the total number of containers to find the number of containers checked on the second day.

First, let's find out how many containers were checked on the first day. We know that the tax officers checked 2 containers, and each container held 5 cars. Therefore, the number of cars checked on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ cars per container} = 10 \text{ cars} \]

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time is left after the first 3 hours:

mgsm-ja-141,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The total number of bees in the hive is 700.
2. The number of worker bees is 12 times the number of baby bees.
3. The number of queen bees is half the number of baby bees.

Let's denote the number of baby bees as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
- The number of worker bees is \( 12B \).
- The number of queen bees is \( \frac{B}{2} \).

The total number of bees is the sum of the baby bees, worker bees, and queen bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 12B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

To simplify this equation, we need a common denominator for the terms involving \( B \). The common denominator is 2, so we rewrite the equation as:
\[ \frac{2B}{2} + \frac{24B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{2B + 24B + B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{27B}{2} = 700 \]

To solve for \( B \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 27B = 1400 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 27:
\[ B = \frac{1400}{27} \approx 51.85 \]

Since the number of bees must be a whole number, we can infer that the problem is set up such that \( B \) is an integer. Given the context, we can assume \( B = 52 \) (as the problem likely rounds to the nearest whole number).

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ \text{Number of worker bees} = 12B = 12 \times 52 = 624 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{624}\).",624,400

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to get home:
- Steve lives 3 miles from school.
- Steve can ride his bike 1440 feet in 1 minute.
- We need to convert miles to feet: 1 mile = 5280 feet.
- Therefore, 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.
- The time it takes for Steve to get home is the total distance divided by the distance he can travel in one minute: 15840 feet / 1440 feet per minute = 11 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to get home:
- Tim lives 2 miles from school.
- Tim can ride his skateboard 264 feet in 1 minute.
- Therefore, 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.
- The time it takes for Tim to get home is the total distance divided by the distance he can travel in one minute: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes 11 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will get home faster. The difference in time is:

3. Calculate the total number of gallons of lemonade sold.
4. Determine the cost of lemons used.

First, we know that the profit is $25. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total revenue by \( R \) and the total cost by \( C \). The profit is given by:
\[ R - C = 25 \]

The revenue \( R \) is the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. Since they sell each cup for $0.50, if they sold \( n \) cups, the revenue is:
\[ R = 0.50n \]

The cost \( C \) is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Since they make 20 cups per gallon, the cost per gallon is:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars per gallon} \]

If they sold \( n \) cups, the number of gallons sold is:
\[ \frac{n}{20} \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ C = 5 \times \frac{n}{20} = \frac{5n}{20} = \frac{n}{4} \]

Now, substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation:
\[ 0.50n - \frac{n}{4} = 25 \]

To solve for \( n \), we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{2n}{4} - \frac{n}{4} = 25 \]
\[ \frac{n}{4} = 25 \]
\[ n = 25 \times 4 \]
\[ n = 100 \]

So, they sold 100 cups of lemonade. The number of gallons sold is:
\[ \frac{100}{20} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

The cost of lemons used is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]",15,15

Next, let's calculate the car fuel:
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the donation to charity:
\[ \text{Charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times (6000 - 1500 - 2000) = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total expenses and donations:
\[ \text{Total expenses and donations} = 1500 + 2000 + 1250 = 4750 \text{ dollars} \]

mgsm-ja-184,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 on a 6-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]
Converting this to a percentage:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

Next, let's calculate the probability that Jerry will roll an even number twice in a row. The even numbers on a 6-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling an even number twice in a row is:
\[ P(\text{even number twice in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]
Converting this to a percentage:
\[ P(\text{even number twice in a row}) = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

Now, we need to find the difference in percentage points between the two probabilities:
\[ 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \]

So, the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 is 25 percentage points higher than the probability that he will roll an even number twice in a row. The final answer is:

2. **Calculate the Number of Straws for Mice:**
   - Each mouse gets 6 straws.
   - Therefore, the total number of straws for the mice is \( 3x \times 6 = 18x \).

3. **Calculate the Number of Straws for Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages with hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 straws.
   - Therefore, the total number of straws for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

4. **Calculate the Number of Straws for Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 straws given to the rabbits.
   - Therefore, the total number of straws for the rabbits is 20.

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of straws used is the sum of the straws for the mice, hamsters, and rabbits.
   - Given that the total number of straws used is 160, we can write the equation:
     \[
     18x + 50 + 20 = 160
     \]

6. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Combine the constants on the left side:

2. **Usage and Refilling**: Each pen will eventually run out of ink. When a pen runs out, Ram collects its ink and uses it to refill another pen. This process can be repeated until all the pens are used up.

Let's break it down:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- Each pen will eventually run out of ink, and the ink from 5 empty pens can be used to refill one pen.

So, for every 5 pens that run out, Ram can refill 1 pen. This means that for every 5 pens used, 1 pen is effectively reused.

To find out how many pens can be used in total, we need to calculate how many times we can repeat the process of refilling pens:

- The number of times we can refill pens is given by the total number of pens divided by 5 (since 5 pens are used to refill 1 pen).

\[
\text{Number of refills} = \frac{25}{5} = 5
\]

Each refill allows Ram to use an additional pen. Therefore, the total number of pens used is the initial number of pens plus the number of refills:

mgsm-ja-249,"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate and then convert those into calories.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate the same number of cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, Sue also ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times the number of cookies her sister ate. Since her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
- Sue's total cookies: \(5 + 26 = 31\)
- Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since each cookie contains 200 calories:
- Sue's total calories: \(31 \times 200 = 6200\)
- Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\)

Finally, we find the difference in calories between Sue and her sister:
\[6200 - 3600 = 2600\]

Therefore, Sue consumed \(\boxed{2600}\) more calories than her sister.",2600,

polymath-low-ja-2,"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs.
2. Determine the new price of the house after the price increase.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new price.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs.**

The house was purchased for $80,000 and $50,000 was spent on repairs. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the new price of the house after the price increase.**

The price of the house increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the price is now 250% of the original purchase price (100% original price + 150% increase). So, the new price is:
\[ 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the new price minus the total cost:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\).",70000,70000

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   - Distance covered = \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives back home, which is 180 miles.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in traffic, so no distance is covered in these 2 hours.
   - After 2 hours, he drives for the next 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 30 miles per hour.
     - Distance covered in 30 minutes = \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}\).
   - After 2.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour for the remaining time to cover the remaining distance.
     - Remaining distance to cover = \(180 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 165 \text{ miles}\).

   - \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the vacuum cleaners in the green houses.
   - 2 vacuum cleaners in the red houses.
   - Half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange houses.

3. After these sales, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

4. Let's break down the sales step by step:
   - Let \( y \) be the number of vacuum cleaners sold in the green houses. So, \( y = \frac{x}{3} \).
   - After selling \( y \) vacuum cleaners in the green houses, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is \( x - y = x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).
   - She then sold 2 vacuum cleaners in the red houses, so the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
   - She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange houses, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners in the orange houses. The remaining number of vacuum cleaners after the orange house sales is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

5. According to the problem, after all these sales, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

6. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

7. Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12

8. Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36

3. Calculate the total amount of water after adding the orange juice to the pineapple drink, accounting for the 1 liter of orange juice that was spilled.
4. Calculate the total volume of the mixture after the spill.
5. Determine the proportion of water in the final mixture.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange juice.**

The orange juice is 3/5 water. So, the amount of water in the orange juice is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{3}{5} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is 5/8 water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{75}{8} = 9.375 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water after adding the orange juice to the pineapple drink, accounting for the 1 liter of orange juice that was spilled.**

Since 1 liter of the orange juice was spilled, the amount of orange juice added is 9 liters, which contains:
\[ 9 \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{27}{5} = 5.4 \text{ liters} \text{ of water} \]

So, the total amount of water in the mixture is:

polymath-low-ja-24,"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine what price, when reduced by 25%, results in $19.50. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Since the book was purchased at 75% of its original price (100% - 25% = 75%), we can write the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book is \( \boxed{26} \).",26,26

polymath-low-ja-28,"To determine the distance between the first and second stops, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. Henry starts his journey and travels 20 miles before the first stop.
2. The total distance of the journey is 60 miles.
3. The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the journey.

First, we calculate the distance from the start to the second stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means the second stop is at the 45-mile mark. Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop and the second stop. The first stop is at the 20-mile mark, and the second stop is at the 45-mile mark. Therefore, the distance between the first and second stops is:

polymath-low-ja-29,"Let's denote the price of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice that amount, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars. The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the price of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \).",104,104
polymath-low-ja-30,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrel and Allen based on the given ratio and their combined age, and then calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

1. **Determine the current ages of Darrel and Allen:**
   - The ratio of Darrel's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
   - Let Darrel's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\).
   - The sum of their ages is given as 162.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \(7x + 11x = 162\).

2. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9

polymath-low-ja-31,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first person estimates that there are 80 jelly beans in the bottle.
2. The second person's estimate is 20 more than half of the first person's estimate. So, we calculate half of 80 and then add 20:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third person's estimate is 25% more than the first person's estimate. So, we calculate 25% of 80 and then add it to 80:
   \[
   80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we have the three estimates: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average of these estimates, we sum them up and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average of the three estimates is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
