mgsm-fr-47,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Jean spent on cravats, given the information about the quantities and prices of the cravats.

First, let's find out how many cravats Jean bought. We know that the cravats bleues (blue cravats) cost $40 each and Jean spent $200 on them. We can calculate the number of blue cravats as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue cravats} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]
Jean bought 5 blue cravats. According to the problem, he bought two times as many red cravats as blue cravats. Therefore, the number of red cravats is:
\[
\text{Number of red cravats} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]
Next, we need to determine the cost of each red cravat. The problem states that the red cravats cost 50% more than the blue cravats. Since the blue cravats cost $40 each, the cost of each red cravat is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red cravat} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]
Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red cravats:
\[
\text{Total cost of red cravats} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]
Finally, we add the cost of the blue cravats and the red cravats to find the total amount Jean spent:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]
Thus, the total amount Jean spent on cravats is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]",800,800

mgsm-fr-76,"To determine how many bags of dog food Cécilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of food the chiot will consume in those 180 days.

1. The chiot will eat 1 bowl of food per day for the first 180 days.
2. Therefore, the total amount of food consumed in the first 180 days is:
   \[
   1 \text{ bowl/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ bowls}
   \]

Next, we need to convert the total amount of food from bowls to bags. Given that 1 bag contains 110 bowls, we can find the number of bags needed by dividing the total number of bowls by the number of bowls per bag:
\[
\frac{180 \text{ bowls}}{110 \text{ bowls/bag}} \approx 1.6363636363636363
\]

Since Cécilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food to cover the first 180 days.

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cécilia will use in the first year is:

First, we know that Sara does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sara does 4 times more laundry than David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does as follows:
\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sara's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sara. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does as follows:
\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sara's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond does and the amount of laundry David does:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:
\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we sum their weights:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults. Each adult needs 10 pounds of potato salad. There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children. Each child needs half the amount of potato salad that an adult needs, which is:

1. Calculate the total number of pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.
2. Subtract the total distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find the remaining amount.

First, we calculate the total number of pounds of carrots distributed to the restaurants. Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total distribution is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the total distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find the remaining amount. The initial amount of carrots is 200 pounds. So, we have:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

mgsm-fr-205,"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 for the semester, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score required for a 93 average:**
   - There are 6 tests in total.
   - The desired average is 93.
   - Therefore, the total score needed is \( 93 \times 6 = 558 \).

2. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   - The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - Summing these scores: \( 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \).

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The total score for all six tests is \( 438 + x \).
   - We need this total to be 558 to achieve an average of 93.
   - Therefore, \( 438 + x = 558 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

5. **Consider the rule of removing the lowest score:**
   - The lowest score among the first five tests is 71.
   - If Brinley removes 71, the new total score for the remaining five tests is \( 438 - 71 = 367 \).
   - To achieve an average of 93 with the remaining five tests, the total score needed is \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \).
   - Therefore, the score needed on the sixth test is \( 465 - 367 = 98 \).

Thus, Brinley must score at least \( \boxed{98} \) on her sixth test to have a final average of 93 after removing her lowest score.",93,98

mgsm-fr-214,"Let's denote the current amount of water in the large pool as \( L \) gallons and in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. The fountains empty both pools at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

First, let's establish the relationship between the large and small pools 4 minutes ago. At that time, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, if we let the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago be \( S_0 \), then the amount of water in the large pool 4 minutes ago was \( 2S_0 \).

Since both pools lose water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, the large pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the large pool is \( 2S_0 - 16 \) and in the small pool is \( S_0 - 16 \).

According to the problem, the large pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 64 \]
\[ 2S_0 - 4S_0 = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2S_0 = -48 \]
\[ S_0 = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. Since the small pool loses 16 gallons in 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S_0 - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is \(\boxed{8}\) gallons.",8,8

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet has the moitié (half) of Zack's age. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age}
   \]
   Substituting Harriet's age:
   \[
   21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age}
   \]
   Solving for Zack's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age}
   \]
   Substituting Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66
     \]
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by the number of people:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3}
   \]
   Simplify the sum:
   \[
   66 + 24 + 45 = 135
   \]
   Divide by 3:
   \[
   \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\).",45,45

mgsm-fr-226,"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has initially:

- Type feu: 30 cards
- Type herbe: 20 cards
- Type eau: 40 cards

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards

Next, we account for the changes in the number of cards:

- James loses 8 cards of type eau, so the new count for type eau cards is:
  40 - 8 = 32 cards

- James buys 14 more cards of type herbe, so the new count for type herbe cards is:
  20 + 14 = 34 cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:

- New total = 30 (feu) + 34 (herbe) + 32 (eau) = 96 cards

We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen card is of type eau. The probability is given by the ratio of the number of type eau cards to the total number of cards, expressed as a percentage.

\[ \text{Probability of type eau card} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number:

3. Subtract the sum of these two groups from the total number of pingouins to find out how many are still taking a sun bath.

First, we calculate the number of pingouins that plonge and nagent dans l'océan. Since one third of the pingouins do this, we have:
\[
\frac{36}{3} = 12
\]
So, 12 pingouins are in the ocean.

Next, we calculate the number of pingouins that go into the cave to eat their dinner. Again, since one third of the pingouins do this, we have:

The total number of pieces Gretchen has is the sum of the silver and gold pieces, which is given as 110. So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( S \). We do this by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver pieces. Since the number of gold pieces is 30 more than the number of silver pieces, we can find the number of gold pieces by adding 30 to 40:

   \[
   \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   Jean buys 8 video games, each costing $20.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}

1. **Total weekly distance**: Jean runs 60 miles each week.
2. **Number of days he runs**: Jean runs 3 days a week.
3. **Distance on the first day**: On the first day, Jean runs for 3 hours. Let's denote his speed on the first day as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is \( 3v \) miles.
4. **Distance on the other two days**: On the other two days, Jean runs half the distance he runs on the first day. So, the distance he runs on each of these two days is \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles. Therefore, the total distance for these two days is \( 2 \times \frac{3v}{2} = 3v \) miles.
5. **Total weekly distance equation**: The total distance Jean runs in a week is the sum of the distances he runs on each of the three days. So, we have:
   \[
   3v + 3v = 60 \implies 6v = 60 \implies v = 10

polymath-low-fr-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories you can still consume for the day.
2. Determine how many portions of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the number of portions into grams of chips.

First, let's find out how many calories you can still consume:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many portions of chips you can eat with 200 calories. Since each portion contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of portions as follows:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/portion}} = 0.8 \text{ portions} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of portions into grams of chips. We know that 5 portions are 300 grams, so each portion is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ portions}} = 60 \text{ grams/portion} \]

Therefore, 0.8 portions would be:
\[ 0.8 \text{ portions} \times 60 \text{ grams/portion} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

polymath-low-fr-44,"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of producing 20 bougies.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 bougies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of producing 20 bougies.**

First, we need to determine how many pounds of beeswax are required to produce 20 bougies. Since each pound of beeswax produces 10 bougies, we can calculate the required pounds of beeswax as follows:
\[
\text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ bougies}}{10 \text{ bougies per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the beeswax and the wicks. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 10.00 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 bougies.**

The revenue from selling 20 bougies at $2.00 each is:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ bougies} \times 2.00 \text{ dollars per bougie} = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\text{Net profit} = 40.00 \text{ dollars} - 20.00 \text{ dollars} = 20.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20.00}\).",0,20

1. Calculate the number of articles written on each day.
2. Determine the total number of articles written over the three days.
3. Convert the total number of articles into hours, given that each article takes 4 hours to write.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Mérédith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7

polymath-low-fr-46,"To determine how many pense-bêtes were in the pack Candice bought, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Candice started with 80 pense-bêtes in her bag.
2. **Pense-bêtes Used**: She placed one pense-bête on each of the 220 tasses of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 pense-bêtes.
3. **Remaining Pense-bêtes**: After placing the pense-bêtes on the tasses, she had 23 left.

Let's denote the number of pense-bêtes in the pack she bought as \( x \).

The total number of pense-bêtes she had before placing them on the tasses can be expressed as:
\[ 80 + x \]

After placing 220 pense-bêtes on the tasses, the number of pense-bêtes left is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after this, she had 23 pense-bêtes left:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of pense-bêtes in the pack she bought is \(\boxed{163}\).",163,163

polymath-low-fr-50,"To determine how much Lloyd earns from selling his eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings by multiplying the daily earnings by 7 (the number of days in a week).

First, we know that Lloyd's hens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can find the number of dozens produced per day by dividing 252 by 12:
\[
\frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozen}

Let's denote the surface areas of the floors from top to bottom as follows:
- The topmost floor (4th floor): \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet
- The 3rd floor: \( A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \) square feet
- The 2nd floor: \( A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \) square feet
- The bottom floor (1st floor): \( A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \) square feet

Next, we calculate the total surface area of the sandcastle by summing the areas of all four floors:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \text{ square feet}

1. Calculate the total initial investment.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the increase.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the initial investment from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total initial investment.**

Josh buys the house for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in its restoration. Therefore, the total initial investment is:

First, let's calculate the distance Jean travels in the first 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Jean travels in the return trip. He spends 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours at 30 mph, and then the remaining time at 80 mph. The total return time is 4 hours, so the time spent at 80 mph is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2 \, \text{hours} - 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance for each segment of the return trip:
\[ \text{Distance in traffic} = 0 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance at 30 mph} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance at 80 mph} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance traveled in the return trip is:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since Jean initially traveled 180 miles away from home and then returned 135 miles, the net distance from his home is:

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost of planting the lemon tree is $90.

2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons, which are sold at $1.50 each. Therefore, the annual revenue is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.50 \text{ dollars/year}

mgsm-fr-13,"Let's denote the initial number of aspirators Mélanie had as \( x \).

1. Mélanie sold a third of her aspirators at the House Green. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) aspirators and had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) aspirators left.
2. She then sold 2 aspirators at the House Red. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) aspirators left.
3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the House Orange. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) aspirators and had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) left. According to the problem, after these sales, she had 5 aspirators left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
4. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[

   \]
5. Next, isolate the term with \( x \) by adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12

6. Then, solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 3/2:
   \[
   x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18

   Let \( A \) be Allen's current age.

2. **Set up the ratio equation:**
   The ratio of Darell's age to Allen's age is given as 7:11. Therefore, we can write:

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the number of silver pieces is 40. Since the number of gold pieces is 30 more than the number of silver pieces, we have:

1. Jean sells 13 Lego sets at $15 each.
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Jean buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   \[
   \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. After buying the video games, Jean has $5 left.
   \[
   \text{Money left after buying video games} = 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Now, we need to find out how many Lego sets Jean can buy with the remaining $30.
   \[
   \text{Number of Lego sets Jean can buy} = \left\lfloor \frac{30}{15} \right\rfloor = 2
   \]
   So, Jean can buy 2 more Lego sets, and he will have:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Lego sets} = 13 - 2 = 11
   \]

Therefore, the number of Lego sets Jean has left is \(\boxed{11}\).",11,2
mgsm-fr-38,"To determine Jean's running speed, we need to break down the information given and calculate the distance he runs each day, then find his overall speed.

1. **Total weekly distance**: Jean runs 60 miles each week.
2. **Number of days per week**: Jean runs 3 days a week.
3. **Distance on the first day**: Jean runs 3 hours on the first day.
4. **Distance on the other two days**: He runs half the distance of the first day on each of the other two days.

Let's denote the distance Jean runs on the first day as \( d_1 \). Since he runs 3 hours on the first day, we can express \( d_1 \) as:
\[ d_1 = 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \]

On the other two days, he runs half the distance of the first day, so the distance on each of these days is:
\[ d_2 = d_3 = \frac{d_1}{2} \]

The total distance run in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Substituting the expressions for \( d_2 \) and \( d_3 \):
\[ d_1 + \frac{d_1}{2} + \frac{d_1}{2} = 60 \]
\[ d_1 + d_1 = 60 \]
\[ 2d_1 = 60 \]
\[ d_1 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

So, Jean runs 30 miles on the first day. The distance he runs on each of the other two days is:
\[ d_2 = d_3 = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we can find his speed. The total distance run in a week is 60 miles, and he runs for a total of 3 days. We need to find the total time he runs in a week. Since he runs 3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on each of the other two days:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

His speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Jean's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",10,10
mgsm-fr-39,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds at which Dana runs, walks, and jumps, and then calculate the total distance she covers in six hours given the time she spends on each activity.

1. **Determine the running speed:**
   - Dana jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
   - She jumps two times less than she runs, so her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the walking speed:**
   - Dana runs four times faster than she walks.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Dana spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of her time running.
   - She spends \(\frac{2}{3}\) of her time walking.

4. **Calculate the distance covered in each activity:**
   - Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Distance covered running: \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12\) miles.
   - Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.
   - Distance covered walking: \(1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6\) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance covered:**
   - Total distance = Distance covered running + Distance covered walking
   - Total distance = \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.

Thus, the total distance Dana covers in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles.",18,18
mgsm-fr-40,"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

mgsm-fr-41,"When Polly holds the sapphire gem, she can throw the golden javelin three times farther than her normal throw. Her normal throw distance is 400 feet. Therefore, with the sapphire gem, she can throw the javelin \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) feet.

Since Perg, the dragon, can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet, Polly needs to be at least 1001 feet away to be out of the dragon's reach. Given that Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the sapphire gem, she can definitely throw it beyond the dragon's breath range.

Thus, the maximum distance Polly can maintain from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the javelin is 1200 feet.

mgsm-fr-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining calories you can consume.
2. Determine how many portions of chips you can eat with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the number of portions to grams of chips.

First, let's find out how many calories you have left to consume. Your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many portions of chips you can eat with 200 calories. Since each portion of chips contains 250 calories, the number of portions you can eat is:
\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ portions} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of portions to grams of chips. We know that 300 grams of chips contain 5 portions. Therefore, the number of grams per portion is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ portions}} = 60 \text{ grams per portion} \]

So, the number of grams of chips you can eat is:
\[ 0.8 \text{ portions} \times 60 \text{ grams per portion} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the number of grams of chips you can eat is \(\boxed{48}\).",48,48
mgsm-fr-44,"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 bougies.
2. Determine the total cost of producing 20 bougies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 bougies.**

Each bougie is sold for $2.00. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 bougies is:
\[ 20 \text{ bougies} \times \$2.00 \text{ per bougie} = \$40.00 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of producing 20 bougies.**

First, we need to find out how many pounds of cire d'abeille are required to produce 20 bougies. Since each pound of cire d'abeille produces 10 bougies, the number of pounds needed is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ bougies}}{10 \text{ bougies per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of 2 pounds of cire d'abeille and mèches is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.**

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20
mgsm-fr-45,"First, let's determine the number of articles Mérédith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \) articles. Calculating this:
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
  \]
  So, on Tuesday, she wrote:
  \[
  5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday. So, she wrote:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4 to find the total number of hours spent writing:

Thus, the total number of hours Mérédith spent writing articles over these three days is \(\boxed{104}\).",104,104
mgsm-fr-46,"To determine how many pense-bêtes were in the pack Candice bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Candice started with 80 pense-bêtes in her bag.
2. **Pense-bêtes Used**: She placed one pense-bête on each of the 220 tasses de café. Therefore, she used 220 pense-bêtes.
3. **Remaining Pense-bêtes**: After placing the pense-bêtes on the tasses, she had 23 left.

Let's denote the number of pense-bêtes in the pack she bought as \( x \).

The total number of pense-bêtes she had before placing them on the tasses can be expressed as:
\[ 80 + x \]

After placing 220 pense-bêtes on the tasses, the number of pense-bêtes left is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after this, she had 23 pense-bêtes left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]
\[
x - 140 = 23

mgsm-fr-109,"To determine the final price after remboursements, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline before any remboursements.
2. Calculate the total remboursement for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total remboursement from the total cost to find the final price.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gasoline.
The price per gallon is $3.00. Therefore, the cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total remboursement for 10 gallons.
The remboursement rate is $0.20 per gallon. Therefore, the remboursement for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Subtract the total remboursement from the total cost to find the final price.
\[ 30.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 28.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final price after the remboursements is \(\boxed{28.00}\).",0,28
mgsm-fr-110,"To determine the average number of roulés each person ate, we first need to calculate the total number of roulés each person ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of roulés Béatrice ate:
- Béatrice has 2 roulés larges and 24 roulés longs.
- Assuming the number of roulés larges and longs is the same for both, we can denote the number of roulés large as \( L \) and the number of roulés long as \( l \).
- Since the problem does not specify the exact number of roulés large and long, we assume the roulés are counted as individual items without further differentiation in the problem's context.

So, Béatrice ate \( 2 + 24 = 26 \) roulés.

Next, let's calculate the total number of roulés Marcell ate:
- Marcell has 3 roulés larges and 14 roulés longs.
- Similarly, Marcell ate \( 3 + 14 = 17 \) roulés.

Now, we find the total number of roulés eaten by both:
- Total roulés eaten = \( 26 + 17 = 43 \).

Since there are two people, the average number of roulés each person ate is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{43}{2} = 21.5 \]

Thus, the average number of roulés each person ate is \(\boxed{21.5}\).",5,45
mgsm-fr-111,"To determine how much water the boat had taken in by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rate of water intake per second:**
   - The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Julia took 64 seconds to reach the shore.
   - First, find out how many 10-foot segments Julia rowed in 64 seconds.
   - Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the rate of rowing is:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}
     \]
   - In 64 seconds, the number of 10-foot segments rowed is:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{4 \text{ seconds per 5 feet}} \times \frac{10 \text{ feet}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ segments}

1. Identify the storage capacity of Brittany's phone.
2. Determine the number of canards in the photo Jamal took based on the storage capacity relationship.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can store 1,800 photos, and this is 6 times the storage capacity of Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can find the storage capacity of Brittany's phone by dividing Jamal's phone capacity by 6:
\[
\text{Storage capacity of Brittany's phone} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \text{ photos}
\]

Next, we know that Brittany's phone can store 50 times the number of canards in the photo Jamal took. Let \( x \) be the number of canards in the photo Jamal took. Then:
\[
300 = 50x

First, let's calculate the total cost of the wood she originally bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 planches:**
   - Sasha bought 10 planches at $10 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2x4x10 planches} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 planches:**
   - Sasha bought 5 planches at $16 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4x4x10 planches} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining wood. Since the prices have increased by 50%, the new prices are:
- New price of 2x4x10 planches: \(10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars each}\)
- New price of 4x4x10 planches: \(16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars each}\)

4. **Revenue from selling 2x4x10 planches:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from 2x4x10 planches} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Revenue from selling 4x4x10 planches:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from 4x4x10 planches} = 5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we calculate the benefit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Benefit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 270 - 180 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Sasha's total benefit from selling the remaining wood is \(\boxed{90}\).",90,90
mgsm-fr-116,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of tablespoons of sugar Katy used based on the given ratio and the total number of tablespoons of sugar and water she used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

We know that the total number of tablespoons of sugar and water used is 120. Since the ratio tells us that 7 parts are sugar and 13 parts are water, we can set up the following equation to find the value of one part:

\[
7 \text{ parts (sugar)} + 13 \text{ parts (water)} = 20 \text{ parts}
\]

\[
20 \text{ parts} = 120 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of tablespoons by the total number of parts:

\[
1 \text{ part} = \frac{120 \text{ tablespoons}}{20} = 6 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

Since the number of parts of sugar is 7, the number of tablespoons of sugar used is:

\[
7 \text{ parts} \times 6 \text{ tablespoons per part} = 42 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

Therefore, the number of tablespoons of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\).",42,42

mgsm-fr-118,"To determine the number of conteneurs imported the second day, we start by calculating the total number of vehicles initially present in the port. According to the problem, on the first day, there were 2 conteneurs, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ conteneurs} \times 5 \text{ véhicules par conteneur} = 10 \text{ véhicules} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles in the port increased to 30. Let \( x \) be the number of conteneurs imported on the second day. Since each of these conteneurs also contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles added on the second day is \( 5x \). Therefore, the equation representing the total number of vehicles on the second day is:

\[ 10 \text{ véhicules} + 5x = 30 \text{ véhicules} \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 10 + 5x = 30 \]
\[ 5x = 30 - 10 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Sum the two salaries four years later.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's initial salary.**

Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Let \( L \) be Lylah's initial salary. Then Adrien's initial salary is \( 1.3L \). We know Adrien's initial salary was $40,000, so:
\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was $30,769.23.

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary four years later was 40% higher than his initial salary. So, Adrien's salary four years later is:
\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later is 40% higher than her initial salary. So, Lylah's salary four years later is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

**Step 4: Sum the two salaries four years later.**

The total of their two salaries four years later is:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total of their two salaries four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\).",92,95200

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 licornes are women. The problem states that two thirds of the licornes in the Highlands are women. Therefore, we calculate the number of female licornes in the Highlands as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female licornes in the Highlands} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

However, the question only asks for the number of licornes in the Highlands, not the number of female licornes. So, the number of licornes in the Highlands is:

mgsm-fr-137,"First, let's calculate the cost of the items Rory is ordering:

- The cost of 2 sous-marins at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 packs of fries at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 biscuits at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items. The delivery fee is calculated as:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items gives:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, Rory adds a tip of $5.00, so the total cost of the order including the tip is:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's order including delivery and tip is \(\boxed{29.00}\).",0,29

First, let's verify the time Marc took to complete each test:
- For the first test, Marc took 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. This is consistent because \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions per 8 hours, but since he completed 75 questions, it means he completed the test within the given time.
- For the second test, Marc took 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. This is also consistent because \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions per 6 hours, but since he completed 100 questions, it means he completed the test within the given time.

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions Marc attempted:
- For the first test, Marc attempted 75 questions.
- For the second test, Marc attempted 100 questions.

The total number of questions Marc attempted is:
\[75 + 100 = 175\]

The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[75 + 100 = 175\]

Since Marc attempted all the questions in both tests, the number of questions he left unanswered is:

According to the problem, the number of blue gum balls is 22 times the number of pink gum balls, which can be written as:
\[ B = 22P \]

We are also given that the number of blue gum balls is 12. Therefore, we can substitute \( B \) with 12 in the equation:
\[ 12 = 22P \]

To find the number of pink gum balls, we need to solve for \( P \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 22:
\[ P = \frac{12}{22} \]

We can simplify the fraction \(\frac{12}{22}\) by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ P = \frac{12 \div 2}{22 \div 2} = \frac{6}{11} \]

mgsm-fr-140,"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the 20 available cars, we first need to find out how many of the cars are semi-automatic.

We know the total number of cars is 20, and the breakdown is as follows:
- 12 cars are automatic
- 4 cars are manual
- The rest are semi-automatic

First, we calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars}
\]
\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula for percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100

polymath-low-fr-82,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of Alex and then find the sum of the weights of Grace and Alex.

First, we know that Grace's weight is 125 pounds. We need to find out how much Alex weighs. According to the problem, Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 \]

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:

\[ \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, we subtract 2 from 500:

\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex's weight is 498 pounds. Now, we need to find the sum of Grace's and Alex's weights:

\[ \text{Sum of their weights} = \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498 \]

The total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and the games lost. Thus, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 6L = 22 \]
\[ 7L = 22 \]
\[ L = \frac{22}{7} \]
\[ L = 3.142857 \]

Since the number of games lost must be a whole number, we need to check if 3.142857 is a whole number. Clearly, it is not, so we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints to ensure we are interpreting it correctly. However, since the problem setup is typical and the solution should be a whole number, we can infer that the correct interpretation is that the number of games lost is 3, and the number of games won is 18 (since \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \)).

So, the number of games won is:
\[ 6L = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

polymath-low-fr-90,"To determine how many kilos of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult needs 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) pounds.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child needs half the amount of potato salad needed for an adult, which is \(10 \div 2 = 5\) pounds.
- There are 5 children.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) pounds.

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad needed for the adults and the children to get the total amount of potato salad required:
- Total potato salad = \(200 + 25 = 225\) pounds.

Since there are 2.20462 pounds in a kilogram, we convert the total amount of potato salad from pounds to kilograms:
- Total potato salad in kilograms = \(225 \div 2.20462 \approx 102.05\) kilograms.

- Amy's age = \( A \)
- Jackson's age = \( J \)
- Corey's age = \( C \)

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Jacques is 10 years old, so \( Q = 10 \).
2. Jacques is 1 year younger than Corey, so \( Q = C - 1 \). Since \( Q = 10 \), we have \( 10 = C - 1 \), which means \( C = 11 \).
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so \( A = J + 5 \).
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so \( A = C - 2 \). Since \( C = 11 \), we have \( A = 11 - 2 = 9 \).

Now, using the information that \( A = J + 5 \) and \( A = 9 \), we can find Jackson's age:

4. Subtract the number of girls who are members of the scouts from the total number of girls to find the number of girls who are not members of the scouts.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of students in the class is 200. The fraction of students who are boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \). So, the number of boys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80

3. Calculate how many cars remained in the traffic jam and how many of those were able to move during the first 15 minutes.

Let's start with the initial number of cars:
- Initially, there are 30 cars on the highway.

Next, we know that 5 cars left the highway before the traffic jam started to affect their movement:
- Therefore, the number of cars that remained in the traffic jam is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

During the first 15 minutes, some cars were able to move. We are told that 20 cars managed to move during the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam. However, we need to find out how many cars moved during the first 15 minutes. Since the total number of cars that moved during the entire 30 minutes is 20, and we need to find out how many moved in the first 15 minutes, we need to consider the total movement over the 30 minutes.

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of cars that moved in the first 15 minutes, we can infer that the number of cars that moved in the first 15 minutes plus the number that moved in the last 15 minutes equals 20. If we assume that the movement was continuous and equal over the 30 minutes, then the number of cars that moved in the first 15 minutes would be half of 20, which is 10.

polymath-low-fr-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for the total time he spent watching television over the week and subtract the time spent on other days.

First, let's calculate the total time spent watching television each day:

- **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1 hour each day.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Thursday**: Frankie watched 1 hour and 30 minutes.
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Friday**: Frankie watched 2 hours.
  \[
  2 \text{ hours}

This year, Henri wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he planned to make \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up making 15 more than he planned, so he made \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After making the cookies, he dropped 5 of them, so the number of cookies he actually has is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, he ended up with 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

mgsm-fr-142,"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he used his time playing video games to work instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week.
2. Determine how much money Jordan earns per hour from his part-time job.
3. Multiply the total hours spent playing video games by the hourly wage to find the weekly earnings.

First, let's find out how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays 2 hours each day and there are 7 days in a week, we calculate:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we know that Jordan earns $10 per hour from his part-time job. Therefore, his weekly earnings if he worked all the time he currently spends playing video games would be:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount of money Jordan would earn in a week if his time spent playing video games was instead used for work is:

mgsm-fr-143,"To determine the total cost of Jean's purchases, we need to break down the expenses and apply the tax where necessary.

First, let's list the items and their costs:
- Lait: 2$
- Œufs: 3$
- Ampoules: 3$
- Tasses: 3$
- Pièges à cafards: 4$

Next, we identify which items are non-alimentary. The tasses and pièges à cafards are non-alimentary, so we need to apply a 10% tax to these items.

Calculate the total cost of the non-alimentary items:
\[ \text{Total cost of non-alimentary items} = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \]

Now, calculate the tax on the non-alimentary items:
\[ \text{Tax on non-alimentary items} = 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \]

Add the tax to the cost of the non-alimentary items:
\[ \text{Total cost of non-alimentary items with tax} = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now, add the cost of the alimentary items (lait, œufs, and ampoules):
\[ \text{Total cost of alimentary items} = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \]

Finally, add the total cost of the alimentary items to the total cost of the non-alimentary items with tax:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 11 = 19 \]

Thus, the total cost of Jean's purchases is \(\boxed{19}\).",19,16

1. Calculate the number of ananas per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of ananas per hectare per year by the total number of hectares Jean has.

First, we know that Jean has 10 hectares and there are 100 ananas per hectare. Since Jean harvests the ananas every 3 months, he harvests 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

The number of ananas per hectare per year is:
\[ 100 \text{ ananas/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ ananas/hectare/year} \]

Now, we multiply the number of ananas per hectare per year by the total number of hectares:

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to reach the school. Steve lives 3 miles away and rides his bicycle at a speed of 440 feet per minute. We need to convert the distance from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet} \]
The time it takes for Steve to reach the school is:
\[ \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach the school. Tim lives 2 miles away and skateboards at a speed of 264 feet per minute. Converting 2 miles to feet, we get:
\[ 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet} \]
The time it takes for Tim to reach the school is:
\[ \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Steve is the winner, he will wait for Tim to finish the race. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:

Thus, the winner will wait for the loser to finish the race for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes.",4,4
mgsm-fr-151,"To determine how much money Shawnda made on that day, we need to calculate the earnings from each group of people who came to have their vehicles' tires inflated.

1. **Calculating earnings from the people with bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - Each tire is inflated for 25 cents.
   - Therefore, each bicycle costs \(2 \times 25 = 50\) cents.
   - 5 people came with bicycles, so the total earnings from bicycles are \(5 \times 50 = 250\) cents.

2. **Calculating earnings from the people with tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - Each tire is inflated for 25 cents.
   - Therefore, each tricycle costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) cents.
   - 3 people came with tricycles, so the total earnings from tricycles are \(3 \times 75 = 225\) cents.

3. **Calculating earnings from the person with a monocycle:**
   - A monocycle has 1 tire.
   - Each tire is inflated for 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the monocycle costs \(1 \times 25 = 25\) cents.
   - 1 person came with a monocycle, so the total earnings from the monocycle are \(1 \times 25 = 25\) cents.

4. **Calculating the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from bicycles + Earnings from tricycles + Earnings from monocycle
   - Total earnings = \(250 + 225 + 25 = 500\) cents

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The hungry seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. After the seagull, 3 pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate are \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 30 \).
5. A weasel then took \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining fries. So the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).
6. Finally, ants took 1 fry, leaving 5 fries. Therefore, the remaining fries before the ants took one are \( 5 + 1 = 6 \).

We can now set up the equation based on the remaining fries:
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6
\]
Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
x - 30 = 18

Adding 30 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 48

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months.
   - A 20% increase means the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Increases**: 
   - There are 36 months in total.
   - The price increases every two months.
   - Therefore, the number of increases is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

4. **Formula for Compound Increase**:
   - The price after \( n \) increases can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
     \]
     where \( P_0 \) is the initial price, \( r \) is the rate of increase, and \( n \) is the number of increases.

5. **Substitute the Values**:
   - \( P_0 = 20 \)
   - \( r = 0.20 \)
   - \( n = 18 \)

   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}

   - The comptable charges $90.

3. Determine the net additional amount of money:
   - If she hires the comptable, she saves the $105 she would have lost doing the tax returns herself, and she also saves the $90 she would have paid to the comptable.
   - Therefore, the total additional amount of money she will have is \(105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, if Jackie engages a comptable, she will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more.",15,15
mgsm-fr-165,"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her vêtements, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items Elvira has chosen:
- Computer: 1090 €
- Scanner: 157 €
- CD burner: 74 €
- Printer: 102 €

Next, we sum these costs:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \]

Elvira's budget is 1500 €. We subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she will have left:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 flans espagnols.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

First, we know that each flan espagnol requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans espagnols, Sandra needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra's neighbor gives her a panier of 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times.",5,5
mgsm-fr-167,"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is 2 times as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In two years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth's current age is \( \boxed{16} \).",16,16

   - Minimum payment for the credit card: $200
   - Minimum payment for the mortgage: $500

   \[
   \text{Total minimum monthly payment} = 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \, \text{dollars}

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting one potato:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, let's convert the peeling time into seconds for easier calculation:

So, the total time to prepare one potato (peeling + cutting) is:
- 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Now, we need to find the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 60 potatoes × 95 seconds per potato = 5700 seconds

Finally, we convert the total time back into minutes:

mgsm-fr-175,"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 20 glasses of lemonade at $0.50 per glass.
   - Total revenue = \( 20 \text{ glasses} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/glass} = 10 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Total cost = Total revenue - Profit = \( 10 \text{ dollars} - 25 \text{ dollars} = -15 \text{ dollars} \).

Since the total cost cannot be negative, it indicates that there is an error in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

3. **Re-evaluate the total cost:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of gallons of lemonade.
   - Cost per gallon = $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.
   - Total cost = \( 5x \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the number of gallons:**
   - They made 20 glasses of lemonade.
   - Assuming each gallon makes a certain number of glasses, let's denote this number as \( g \) glasses per gallon.
   - \( x \times g = 20 \).

5. **Determine the number of gallons:**
   - Since the problem does not specify the number of glasses per gallon, we assume each gallon makes 20 glasses (a common assumption for such problems if not specified).
   - \( x = 1 \text{ gallon} \).

6. **Calculate the total cost for 1 gallon:**
   - Total cost for 1 gallon = \( 5 \text{ dollars} \).

7. **Verify the profit:**
   - Total revenue = $10.
   - Total cost = $5.
   - Profit = \( 10 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars} \).

Since the profit is $5, not $25, there seems to be a discrepancy. However, the question asks specifically about the cost of lemons.

8. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3.

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   The numbers on a six-faced die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   \[
   P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5

   0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

2. **Determine the probability of rolling a number that is not a pair (i.e., an odd number):**
   The numbers that are not pairs (i.e., the odd numbers) are 1, 3, and 5. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

   0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 rather than a pair two times in a row:**
   The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the first roll is 50%, and the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second roll is also 50%. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3 and greater than 3}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25

   Converting this to a percentage:
   \[
   0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

4. **Determine the probability of rolling an odd number rather than a pair two times in a row:**
   The probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 50%, and the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 50%. Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{odd and odd}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25

   Converting this to a percentage:
   \[
   0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

5. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 rather than a pair two times in a row:**
   The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 rather than a pair on a single roll is the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling a pair. The probability of rolling a pair is also 50%, so:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3 rather than pair}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

   Converting this to a percentage:

mgsm-fr-186,"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rats:**
   - We know that 160 morceaux de paille were distributed to the rats.

   - Therefore, the total number of rats is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total number of rats} = \frac{160 \text{ morceaux}}{6 \text{ morceaux/rat}} = \frac{160}{6} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67
     \]
   - Since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem to ensure the calculation is correct. Given the context, it's likely the problem is designed to have a whole number of rats, so we should recheck the division:
     \[
     \frac{160}{6} = 26 \text{ remainder } 4

   - This suggests a potential error in the problem setup or an assumption that the problem is designed to have a whole number of rats. Given the problem constraints, we can assume the problem is designed to have a whole number of rats, and the closest whole number is 26.

2. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**
   - There are 3 cages for the rats.
   - Therefore, the number of rats per cage is:
     \[
     \text{Number of rats per cage} = \frac{26 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = \frac{26}{3} \approx 8.67
     \]
   - Again, given the problem constraints, we assume the problem is designed to have a whole number of rats per cage, and the closest whole number is 8.

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{8}\).",8,5

mgsm-fr-236,"To determine the total number of stylos Ram will have, we need to follow the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 stylos.
2. **Stylos Used and Refilled**: Each time a stylo is empty, its ink is used to fill another empty stylo. This means that for every 5 empty stylos, he can create 1 new full stylo.

Let's calculate the number of new stylos he can create from the 25 initial stylos:

- After using 5 stylos, he can create 1 new stylo.
- After using another 5 stylos, he can create another new stylo.
- After using another 5 stylos, he can create another new stylo.
- After using another 5 stylos, he can create another new stylo.
- After using another 5 stylos, he can create another new stylo.

**Step 1: Calculate the total initial investment.**
Josh buys the house for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in its restoration. Therefore, the total initial investment is:

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = 5 \]

Since every second glass costs 60% of $5, we calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \]

We can see that the pattern will repeat every two glasses. Therefore, the cost for two glasses is:

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we need to determine how many sets of two glasses there are in 16 glasses:
\[ \text{Number of sets of two glasses} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Now, we multiply the cost of one set of two glasses by the number of sets:

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost of planting the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Annual Costs**: Each year, the cost of arming and feeding the tree is $3.
3. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue is $1.5 \times 7 = $10.5.

Let's denote the number of years by \( n \).

The total cost after \( n \) years is:
\[ 90 + 3n \]

The total revenue after \( n \) years is:
\[ 10.5n \]

Carlos will start making a profit when the total revenue exceeds the total cost. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:
\[ 10.5n > 90 + 3n \]

Subtract \( 3n \) from both sides:
\[ 7.5n > 90 \]

Divide both sides by 7.5:
\[ n > \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n > 12 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the smallest integer greater than 12 is 13. Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years to start making a profit from his lemon tree.

1. Mélanie sold a third of her aspirators at the House Green. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) aspirators, and she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) aspirators left.
2. Then, she sold 2 aspirators at the House Red. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) aspirators left.
3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the House Orange. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) aspirators, and she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) aspirators left, which is given to be 5 aspirators. Therefore, we can write the equation:

polymath-low-fr-19,"To determine the required speed for Marissa to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she has to complete the 12-mile hike.

The total distance of the hike is 12 miles. To find the total time required to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the time Marissa has already spent on the hike. She has already spent 1 hour for the first 4 miles and another 1 hour for the next 2 miles:
\[
\text{Time already spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

The remaining time she has to complete the hike is:
\[
\text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time already spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}

The remaining distance to be covered is:
\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:
\[
\text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

1. **Initial Composition of Jus d'Orange:**
   - Total volume of jus d'orange: 10 liters.
   - Water content: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) liters.
   - Juice content: \(10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33\) liters.

2. **Initial Composition of Jus d'Ananas:**
   - Total volume of jus d'ananas: 15 liters.
   - Water content: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25\) liters.
   - Juice content: \(15 - 11.25 = 3.75\) liters.

3. **Mixing the Jus d'Orange and Jus d'Ananas:**
   - When 1 liter of jus d'orange is poured into the 15 liters of jus d'ananas, the volume of the mixture becomes \(15 + 1 = 16\) liters.
   - The water content in the 1 liter of jus d'orange is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67\) liters.
   - The juice content in the 1 liter of jus d'orange is \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33\) liters.
   - Therefore, the new water content in the 16 liters of mixture is \(11.25 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{33.75}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{35.75}{3} \approx 11.92\) liters.
   - The new juice content in the 16 liters of mixture is \(3.75 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{11.25}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{12.25}{3} \approx 4.08\) liters.

4. **Final Volume and Water Content:**
   - After pouring out 1 liter of the mixture, the volume of the remaining mixture is \(16 - 1 = 15\) liters.
   - The water content in the remaining mixture is \(\frac{35.75}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{33.75}{3} = 11.25\) liters.
   - The juice content in the remaining mixture is \(\frac{12.25}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{11.25}{3} = 3.75\) liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water in the 24 liters (15 liters of the mixture plus the 9 liters of jus d'orange that was not poured out) is \(\boxed{11.25}\) liters.",25,15

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find the current ages of Darell and Allen. The current age of Darell is:

\[7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\]

And the current age of Allen is:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Next, we need to find Allen's age in 10 years. Since Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, the age that Allen will have in 10 years is \(\boxed{109}\).",109,109
polymath-low-fr-31,"To find the average of the estimations, we first need to determine the value of each estimation given by Gunter's friends.

1. The first friend estimates 80 bonbons.
2. The second friend estimates 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend estimates \(40 + 20 = 60\) bonbons.
3. The third friend estimates 25% more than the first friend's estimate. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend estimates \(80 + 20 = 100\) bonbons.

Now we have the three estimations: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by the number of estimations, which is 3.

The sum of the estimations is:
\[80 + 60 + 100 = 240\]

The average is:
\[\frac{240}{3} = 80\]

Therefore, the average of their estimations is \(\boxed{80}\).",80,80
