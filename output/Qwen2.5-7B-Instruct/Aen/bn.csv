mgsm-bn-47,"To determine the total amount Jan Neil spent on buying the ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue ties Jan Neil bought.
2. Determine the price of each red tie.
3. Calculate the number of red ties Jan Neil bought.
4. Compute the total cost of the red ties.
5. Add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total expenditure.

First, we know that Jan Neil bought blue ties for $200 at a price of $40 per tie. So, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]

Next, we need to find the price of each red tie. Since the price of red ties is 50% more than the price of blue ties, the price of each red tie is:
\[
40 \times 1.5 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jan Neil bought twice as many blue ties as red ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ red ties}
\]
Since the number of ties must be a whole number, we assume he bought 2.5 ties, which means 2.5 ties at $60 each.

The total cost for the red ties is:
\[
2.5 \times 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the cost of the blue ties and the red ties, the total expenditure is:
\[
200 + 150 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Jan Neil spent on the ties is \(\boxed{350}\).",350,800

mgsm-bn-49,"To determine the number of units under management in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of units under management.
3. Subtract the number of units under management from the total number of units to find the number of units not under management.

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are under management. The problem states that 3/4 of the building is under management. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

This means that 90 units are under management. To find the number of units not under management, we subtract the number of units under management from the total number of units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of units not under management is \(\boxed{30}\).",30,30
mgsm-bn-50,"To determine how much Loader earns per week from selling the eggs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs laid per day.
2. Determine the number of eggs laid per week.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs per week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs laid per day.
The problem states that the hens lay 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Determine the number of eggs laid per week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of eggs laid per week is:

mgsm-bn-52,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many game books need to be removed to reduce the total weight by 15 pounds. We know the following:

- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
- Each game book weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.
- Removing 30 comic books will reduce the weight by \( 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \) pounds.

Since the total reduction needed is 15 pounds, and we have already reduced the weight by 7.5 pounds by removing 30 comic books, we need to reduce the weight by an additional \( 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \) pounds. 

Now, we need to find out how many game books need to be removed to achieve this additional reduction. Let \( x \) be the number of game books to be removed. The weight reduction from removing \( x \) game books is \( x \times \frac{1}{2} \) pounds. We need this to be equal to 7.5 pounds:

\[
x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

So, the number of game books that need to be removed is \( \boxed{15} \).",15,15
mgsm-bn-53,"To determine how much more the mechanic earned on the day with the higher income, we need to calculate the earnings for both days and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the earnings on Bivatibabor (Tuesday):
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- Earnings from truck tires: \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- Earnings from car tires: \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Total earnings on Tuesday: \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings on Shukrobabor (Saturday):
- The mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Earnings from car tires: \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- Total earnings on Saturday: \(480\) dollars.

Now, we compare the earnings of the two days:
- Earnings on Tuesday: \(520\) dollars.
- Earnings on Saturday: \(480\) dollars.
- Difference in earnings: \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Tuesday than on Saturday.",40,40
mgsm-bn-54,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current number of bunnies in Doutfire's family. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of bunnies taken and their characteristics:**
   - Doutfire took 7 bunnies from the local animal shelter.
   - One of these bunnies is named Patches and has 3 times as many bunnies as the other bunnies.
   - The other bunnies are named Trixie and have 12 bunnies each.

2. **Calculate the number of bunnies taken from the shelter:**
   - Let the number of bunnies taken from the shelter be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, Patches has 3 times as many bunnies as the other bunnies. So, if the other bunnies have \( y \) bunnies each, then Patches has \( 3y \) bunnies.
   - Since Patches and Trixie are the only bunnies taken from the shelter, we have \( x = 3y + 12 \).
   - We also know that the total number of bunnies taken is 7, so \( x = 7 \).

3. **Set up the equation and solve for \( y \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 7 \) into the equation \( x = 3y + 12 \):
     \[
     7 = 3y + 12
     \]
   - Subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     7 - 12 = 3y
     \]
     \[
     -5 = 3y
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     y = -\frac{5}{3}
     \]
   - Since \( y \) must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The problem states that Patches has 3 times as many bunnies as the other bunnies, and the other bunnies have 12 bunnies each. So, Patches must have \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) bunnies. This means the total number of bunnies taken from the shelter is \( 36 + 12 = 48 \), but since only 7 bunnies were taken, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the current number of bunnies in the family, we can proceed with the given information.

4. **Calculate the current number of bunnies in the family:**
   - Initially, Doutfire's family had 2 bunnies (the two that became parents).
   - They now have 7 bunnies from the shelter.
   - The total number of bunnies in the family is the sum of the initial bunnies and the bunnies from the shelter:
     \[
     2 + 7 = 9
     \]

Therefore, the current number of bunnies in Doutfire's family is \(\boxed{9}\).",9,40

2. **Determine the total weight of the truck and driver:**
   The combined weight of the truck and the driver is 3755 pounds.

3. **Calculate the maximum additional weight the truck can carry:**
   Since the bridge can carry more than 5000 pounds, we need to find the difference between the bridge's weight limit and the truck's weight:
   \[
   \text{Maximum additional weight} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the weight of each box:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds.

mgsm-bn-75,"To find the average area of each level of the 4-level Balih fortress, we start by noting the relationship between the areas of the levels. The area of each level is half the area of the level directly below it.

Given:
- The area of the top level (4th level) is 16 square feet.

Let's denote the area of each level from top to bottom as follows:
- Level 4: \( A_4 = 16 \) square feet
- Level 3: \( A_3 = \frac{A_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
- Level 2: \( A_2 = \frac{A_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
- Level 1: \( A_1 = \frac{A_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we calculate the average area of the four levels by summing the areas and dividing by the number of levels:
\[
\text{Average area} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}

mgsm-bn-78,"To determine the best deal for Vincent to buy 18 flowers, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers at each of the given prices.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers at $2.50 per package of 3 flowers:
- Each package costs $2.50 and contains 3 flowers.
- To find out how many packages are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The total cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers at $1 per 2 flowers:
- Each pair of flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many pairs are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pairs.
- The total cost for 9 pairs is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Comparing the two costs, buying 18 flowers at $1 per 2 flowers is cheaper than buying them at $2.50 per 3 flowers. The difference in cost is:

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost.

We can express these conditions with the following equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won using the second equation:

   - The alarm beeps 4 times.
   - So, the number of beeps for the first alarm is \(4\).

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm beeps 3 times more than the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm beeps 4 times, the second alarm beeps \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
   - So, the number of beeps for the second alarm is \(12\).

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm beeps half the time of the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm beeps 12 times, the third alarm beeps \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.
   - So, the number of beeps for the third alarm is \(6\).

4. **Total Beeps:**
   - To find the total number of beeps, we add the beeps from all three alarms.
   - Total beeps = Beeps from the first alarm + Beeps from the second alarm + Beeps from the third alarm

\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of one pencil} + \text{Cost of one eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is \(\boxed{12.00}\).",0,12

1. **One-time award:**
   Jan received a one-time award of $5000.

2. **Annual salary:**
   Jan's initial weekly salary is $2000. With a 5% annual salary increase, we need to calculate the weekly salary for each year of the year.

   - **First year:**
     \[
     \text{Weekly salary} = \$2000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Annual salary} = \$2000 \times 52 = \$104,000

The formula for the average score is:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}}
\]

Given that Brinli wants an average of 93 over 6 tests, we can set up the equation:
\[
93 = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{6}
\]

To find the total score needed, we multiply both sides by 6:
\[
\text{Total Score} = 93 \times 6 = 558

Next, we need to find the total score Brinli has already achieved on her first five tests. We sum the scores:
\[
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
\]

Let \( x \) be the score Brinli needs on her sixth test. The total score for all six tests will then be:
\[

\]

We set this equal to the total score needed for an average of 93:
\[
438 + x = 558
\]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 438 from both sides:
\[
x = 558 - 438 = 120

First, we know that there are 25 chocolate bars, and each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candy apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candy apple weighs:

From the problem, we know that each plate costs $6000. So, \( P = 6000 \).

The problem also states that the total cost of a dozen plates is $1200 less than the total cost of thirteen dozen cups. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 12P = 13 \times 12C - 1200 \]

Substituting \( P = 6000 \) into the equation, we get:

Adding 1200 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 73200 = 13 \times 12C \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 73200 = 156C \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \frac{73200}{156} = 468.25 \]

Initially, the large reservoir had twice as much water as the small reservoir. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small reservoir as \( x \). Therefore, the initial amount of water in the large reservoir was \( 2x \).

Since both reservoirs have a leak that drains 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, each reservoir would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.

After 4 minutes, the large reservoir now has \( 2x - 16 \) gallons and the small reservoir has \( x - 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, at this point, the large reservoir has four times as much water as the small reservoir. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]
\[ 64 - 16 = 4x - 2x \]
\[ 48 = 2x \]
\[ x = 24 \]

So, initially, the small reservoir had 24 gallons of water. Therefore, the large reservoir initially had \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) gallons of water.

After 4 minutes, the small reservoir has \( 24 - 16 = 8 \) gallons of water, and the large reservoir has \( 48 - 16 = 32 \) gallons of water. This confirms that the large reservoir now has four times as much water as the small reservoir, since \( 32 = 4 \times 8 \).

mgsm-bn-219,"To determine how many points Jozo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by Naomi, Yury, and Brian. Let's start with the points scored by Naomi, which is given as 68 points.

Next, we calculate the points scored by Yury. According to the problem, Yury scored 10 points more than Naomi. Therefore, we have:
\[ \text{Points scored by Yury} = 68 + 10 = 78 \]

Now, we calculate the points scored by Brian. The problem states that Brian scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, we have:
\[ \text{Points scored by Brian} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Let \( J \) be the points scored by Jozo. Then we can write the equation:
\[ 68 + 78 + 85 + J = 251 \]

Now, we simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 231 + J = 251 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 231 from both sides of the equation:
\[ J = 251 - 231 = 20 \]

Therefore, Jozo scored \(\boxed{20}\) points.",20,54

First, let's denote the speed of running as \( v_r \) and the speed of walking as \( v_w \). According to the problem, the speed of running is four times the speed of walking, and the speed of skiing is half the speed of running. Let's denote the speed of walking as \( v_w = v \). Then, the speed of running is \( v_r = 4v \) and the speed of skiing is \( v_s = 2v \).

We are given that the speed of skiing is 3 miles per hour, so \( v_s = 3 \) miles per hour. Therefore, \( 2v = 3 \), which means \( v = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) miles per hour. So, the speed of walking is \( v_w = 1.5 \) miles per hour and the speed of running is \( v_r = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) miles per hour.

Next, we need to determine the time spent on each activity. The problem states that the person spends one-third of the time running, one-third of the time skiing, and the remaining one-third of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, each activity takes \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance covered in each activity:
- Distance covered while running: \( \text{distance}_r = v_r \times \text{time}_r = 6 \times 2 = 12 \) miles.
- Distance covered while skiing: \( \text{distance}_s = v_s \times \text{time}_s = 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles.
- Distance covered while walking: \( \text{distance}_w = v_w \times \text{time}_w = 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \) miles.

The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered in each activity:
\[ \text{total distance} = \text{distance}_r + \text{distance}_s + \text{distance}_w = 12 + 6 + 3 = 21 \text{ miles} \]

polymath-low-bn-46,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Candice initially has 80 Post-It notes.
2. She buys a packet of Post-It notes.
3. She uses 220 Post-It notes to place one on each of 220 coffee cups.
4. After all this, she has 23 Post-It notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-It notes in the packet she bought as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-It notes. After buying the packet, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-It notes. She then used 220 Post-It notes, so she had \( 80 + x - 220 \) Post-It notes left. According to the problem, she had 23 Post-It notes left after using 220 notes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-It notes in the packet she bought is \( \boxed{163} \).",163,163
polymath-low-bn-47,"To determine the total amount Jan Neil spent on the ties, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of blue ties Jan Neil bought.
2. Determine the price of each red tie.
3. Calculate the number of red ties Jan Neil bought.
4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties.
5. Add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to get the total expenditure.

First, we know that Jan Neil bought blue ties for $200 at $40 per tie. So, the number of blue ties he bought is:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we need to find the price of each red tie. Since the price of red ties is 50% more than the price of blue ties, the price of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Price of each red tie} = 40 \times 1.5 = 60
\]

Now, we need to find out how many red ties Jan Neil bought. Since he bought twice as many blue ties as red ties, the number of red ties he bought is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5
\]
Since the number of ties must be a whole number, we assume he bought 2.5 ties, which is typically interpreted as 2 or 3 ties in practical scenarios, but for the sake of this problem, we'll proceed with 2.5 ties.

The total cost of the red ties is:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 2.5 \times 60 = 150
\]

Finally, the total expenditure is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total expenditure} = 200 + 150 = 350
\]

Thus, the total amount Jan Neil spent on the ties is:
\[

2. Determine the total number of eggs laid per week.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
Mr. Loader's hens lay 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Determine the total number of eggs laid per week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs laid per week is:

polymath-low-bn-52,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many comic books and how many game books need to be removed to reduce the total weight by 15 pounds.

First, let's calculate the total weight reduction from removing 30 comic books:
- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
- Therefore, 30 comic books weigh \( 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \) pounds.

Since 7.5 pounds have already been removed by removing 30 comic books, we need to remove an additional \( 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \) pounds.

Next, let's determine how many game books need to be removed to achieve the remaining weight reduction:
- Each game book weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.
- To find the number of game books needed to remove 7.5 pounds, we divide 7.5 by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
  \[
  \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

First, let's calculate the mechanic's earnings on Tuesday:
- He repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- The cost to repair each truck tire is $60.
- The cost to repair each car tire is $40.
- Therefore, his earnings on Tuesday are:
  \[
  6 \times 60 + 4 \times 40 = 360 + 160 = 520
  \]

Next, let's calculate the mechanic's earnings on Thursday:
- He repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- The cost to repair each car tire is $40.
- Therefore, his earnings on Thursday are:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]

Now, we compare the earnings of Tuesday and Thursday:
- Earnings on Tuesday: $520
- Earnings on Thursday: $480
- The difference in earnings is:
  \[
  520 - 480 = 40

1. Doutfire Bonera took 7 ducklings from a local animal shelter.
2. When he returned home, his mother informed him that 2 of his ducks had just hatched 12 ducklings each.
3. The ducklings he took from the shelter had a different distribution:
   - The first duck had three times as many ducklings as the second duck.
   - The second duck had 12 ducklings.

Let's denote the number of ducklings from the first duck as \(3x\) and from the second duck as \(x\). According to the problem, \(x = 12\).

So, the number of ducklings from the first duck is:
\[3x = 3 \times 12 = 36\]

The number of ducklings from the second duck is:
\[x = 12\]

Adding these together, the total number of ducklings from the two ducks he took from the shelter is:
\[36 + 12 = 48\]

Now, we need to add the ducklings that hatched at home:
\[2 \text{ ducks} \times 12 \text{ ducklings per duck} = 24 \text{ ducklings}\]

So, the total number of ducklings in Doutfire Bonera's family is:

- From Monday to Saturday, she attends 5 classes each day. So, for 6 days, she attends:
  \[
  5 \text{ classes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ classes}
  \]
- On Sunday, she attends 8 classes. So, for Sunday, she attends:
  \[
  8 \text{ classes}
  \]
- Therefore, the total number of classes she attends in one week is:
  \[
  30 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 38 \text{ classes}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how many students she teaches in total. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is:
\[
38 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 570 \text{ students}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she earns. Since she charges $15.00 per student, the total amount of money she earns is:
\[
570 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 8550 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the amount of money Judy earns in one week is \(\boxed{8550}\).",8550,7425

1. The area of the topmost level (4th level) is given as 16 square feet.
2. Each level below has an area that is half the area of the level above it.

Let's denote the area of the \( n \)-th level as \( A_n \). According to the problem:
\[ A_4 = 16 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_3 = \frac{1}{2} A_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ square feet} \]
\[ A_2 = \frac{1}{2} A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ square feet} \]

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers by purchasing 3 packages at $2.50 each:
\[
\text{Cost per package} = \$2.50
\]
\[
\text{Number of packages needed} = \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{3 \text{ flowers/package}} = 6 \text{ packages}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 6 \text{ packages} \times \$2.50 \text{ per package} = 6 \times 2.50 = \$15.00

According to the problem, Melani sold:
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) of them in green houses,
- 2 in red houses,
- and half of the remaining in orange houses.

After these sales, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. We can set up the equation based on the information given.

First, calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold in green houses:
\[ \frac{1}{3}x \]

Next, the number of vacuum cleaners sold in red houses is given as 2:
\[ 2 \]

The remaining vacuum cleaners after selling in green and red houses would be:
\[ x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 = \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \]

Melani then sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in orange houses:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \]

The number of vacuum cleaners left after selling in orange houses is:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 \right) \]
\[ = \frac{2}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{3}x + 1 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{3}x - 1 \]

We know that after these sales, Melani had 5 vacuum cleaners left:
\[ \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melani started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Now, we need to find out how many she sold initially.

She sold:
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 18 in green houses:

mgsm-bn-15,"To determine which investment will yield the highest profit by the end of the month, we need to calculate the final value of each investment after the respective market increases.

1. **Investment in Garment:**
   - Initial cost: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Final value = Initial cost + (Initial cost * Market increase)
   - Final value = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
   - Final value = $5,000 + $125
   - Final value = $5,125

2. **Investment in Electronic Gadget:**
   - Initial cost: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Final value = Initial cost + (Initial cost * Market increase)
   - Final value = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
   - Final value = $8,000 + $96
   - Final value = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values of both investments:
- Final value of the garment investment: $5,125
- Final value of the electronic gadget investment: $8,096

The electronic gadget investment yields a higher final value. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the final value:
- Profit from electronic gadget = Final value - Initial cost
- Profit from electronic gadget = $8,096 - $8,000
- Profit from electronic gadget = $96

Thus, the maximum possible profit by the end of the month is $\boxed{96}$.",96,125

mgsm-bn-43,"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total calories in one bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left for the day.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat based on the remaining calories.

First, calculate the total calories in one bag of chips:
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- There are 5 servings in one bag.
- Therefore, the total calories in one bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Next, determine how many calories are left for the day:
- Your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Therefore, the remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

Now, calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:
- Each bag contains 300 grams of chips.
- Each bag has 1250 calories.
- The number of calories per gram of chips = 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.1667 calories/gram (approximately).

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories:
- Number of grams = 200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat $\boxed{48}$ grams of chips.",48,48

2. **Post-It Notes Bought:**
   Candice bought a packet of Post-It notes.

3. **Post-It Notes Used:**
   Candice used 220 Post-It notes, one for each coffee cup.

4. **Remaining Post-It Notes:**
   After using the notes and having some left, Candice has 23 Post-It notes remaining.

5. **Calculating the Total Post-It Notes Used and Remaining:**
   Let's denote the number of Post-It notes in the packet as \( x \).

   The total number of Post-It notes Candice had after buying the packet is:
   \[
   80 + x

1. Calculate the number of boys in the class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in the class.
3. Determine the number of girls in the girls' scout group based on the given fraction.

First, let's find the number of boys in the class. Since 2/3 of the class are girls, the remaining 1/3 of the class are boys. The total number of students is 200.

The number of boys is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 200 = \frac{200}{3} = 66.\overline{6} \approx 66.67
\]
Since the number of students must be a whole number, we can assume the problem is set up such that the numbers work out to whole numbers. So, we can use 67 boys (since 200 - 133 = 67).

The number of girls in the class is:
\[
200 - 67 = 133
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girls' scout group. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girls' scout group. So, we calculate:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 133 = \frac{266}{3} = 88.\overline{6} \approx 88.67
\]
Again, assuming the problem is set up for whole numbers, we can use 89 girls in the girls' scout group (since 133 - 44 = 89).

The number of girls not in the girls' scout group is:
\[
133 - 89 = 44

First, we know that 16 ounces of sauce require 2 tomatoes (since 16 ounces is the amount for 2 tomatoes).

Since the amount of tomatoes needed is halved for the amount of sauce, we can calculate the number of tomatoes needed for 32 ounces of sauce as follows:
\[ \text{Number of tomatoes for 32 ounces} = \frac{2 \text{ tomatoes}}{2} = 4 \text{ tomatoes} \]

mgsm-bn-98,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Cars**: At the start, there are 30 cars on the road.
2. **Cars Leaving the Line**: After 15 minutes, 5 cars leave the line.
3. **Cars Passing Through the Tunnel**: In the first 15 minutes, some cars pass through the tunnel. Let's denote the number of cars that pass through the tunnel in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).
4. **Cars Passing Through the Tunnel in the Second 15 Minutes**: In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars pass through the tunnel.
5. **Final Number of Cars**: After 30 minutes, the number of cars left on the road is the initial number minus the number of cars that left the line plus the number of cars that passed through the tunnel minus the number of cars that passed through the tunnel in the first 15 minutes. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   30 - 5 + 20 - x = \text{number of cars left on the road}
   \]
   Since no cars are left on the road after 30 minutes, the number of cars left on the road is 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   30 - 5 + 20 - x = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   45 - x = 0
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we get:
   \[
   x = 45
   \]
   However, since only 30 cars were initially on the road, the maximum number of cars that could pass through the tunnel in the first 15 minutes is 30. Therefore, the correct number of cars that passed through the tunnel in the first 15 minutes is:

1. **Determine the internal dimensions of one box:**
   - The external dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls of each box are 1 inch thick on all sides. This means that the internal dimensions are reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Therefore, the internal dimensions of each box are:

First, we know that the boat traveled 64 seconds to reach the shore. We also know that the boat traveled 13 feet in 11 seconds. We can use this information to find the speed of the boat and then the total distance traveled.

The speed of the boat is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{13 \text{ feet}}{11 \text{ seconds}} \]

The total distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Total time} = \frac{13 \text{ feet}}{11 \text{ seconds}} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = \frac{13 \times 64}{11} \text{ feet} = \frac{832}{11} \text{ feet} \approx 75.64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat takes 10 feet to gain 2 liters of water. Therefore, the amount of water that entered the boat per foot is:
\[ \text{Water per foot} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]

The total amount of water that entered the boat is:

1. **Determine the number of photos on British's phone:**
   - Jamal's phone has 1800 photos.
   - Jamal's phone has 6 times more photos than British's phone.
   - Let the number of photos on British's phone be \( x \).
   - Therefore, \( 1800 = 6x \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, British's phone has 300 photos.

2. **Determine the number of photos in the henhouse:**
   - The number of photos on British's phone is 50 times more than the number of hens in the henhouse.
   - Let the number of hens in the henhouse be \( y \).
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50y \).

1. **Calculate the total cost of purchasing the boards:**

   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{Number of boards} = 10
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost per board} = \$10
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \times 10 = \$100
     \]

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{Number of boards} = 5
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost per board} = \$16
     \]
     \[

mgsm-bn-116,"To determine how much tea, salt, and sugar Kit uses, we need to solve the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the given ratio and total quantity:
- The ratio of tea to sugar to salt is 7:13.
- The total quantity of tea, sugar, and salt is 120 units.

Let's denote the quantities of tea, sugar, and salt as \(7x\), \(13x\), and \(13x\) respectively, where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total quantity can be expressed as:
\[7x + 13x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[33x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 33:
\[x = \frac{120}{33} = \frac{40}{11}\]

Now, we need to find the quantity of tea, which is \(7x\):
\[7x = 7 \times \frac{40}{11} = \frac{280}{11} = 25.4545 \approx 25.45\]

So, the quantity of tea Kit uses is:

2. Determine the total number of cars after the second day.
3. Subtract the number of cars from the first day from the total number of cars after the second day to find the number of cars that arrived the second day.
4. Convert the number of cars that arrived the second day into the number of containers.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cars in the first day.**
The first day, there were 2 containers, and each container had 5 cars.
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ cars/container} = 10 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of cars after the second day.**
After the second day, the total number of cars in the yard was 30.
\[ \text{Total cars after second day} = 30 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of cars from the first day from the total number of cars after the second day to find the number of cars that arrived the second day.**
\[ \text{Cars that arrived the second day} = 30 \text{ cars} - 10 \text{ cars} = 20 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 4: Convert the number of cars that arrived the second day into the number of containers.**
Since each container holds 5 cars, the number of containers that arrived the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ cars}}{5 \text{ cars/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that arrived the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4

1. **Determine Laila's initial salary:**
   - Adrian's initial salary was $40,000.
   - Adrian's salary was 30% more than Laila's initial salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Laila's initial salary.
   - Therefore, \( 40000 = L + 0.3L \).
   - \( 40000 = 1.3L \).
   - \( L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrian's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrian's salary four years ago was 40% more than his initial salary.
   - Adrian's initial salary was $40,000.
   - Therefore, \( 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \).

3. **Determine Laila's salary four years ago:**
   - Laila's salary four years ago was the same percentage increase as Adrian's.
   - Therefore, \( 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the current salaries after four years of equal percentage increase:**
   - Let \( x \) be the percentage increase.
   - Adrian's current salary: \( 56000 \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) \).
   - Laila's current salary: \( 43076.92 \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) \).

5. **Determine the percentage increase:**
   - Adrian's current salary is 140% of his initial salary.
   - Therefore, \( 56000 \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) = 40000 \times 1.4 \).
   - \( 56000 \times (1 + \frac{x}{100}) = 56000 \).
   - \( 1 + \frac{x}{100} = 1.4 \).
   - \( \frac{x}{100} = 0.4 \).
   - \( x = 40 \).

6. **Calculate the current salaries with a 40% increase:**
   - Adrian's current salary: \( 56000 \times 1.4 = 78400 \).
   - Laila's current salary: \( 43076.92 \times 1.4 = 60207.69 \).

7. **Calculate the total combined salary:**
   - Total combined salary: \( 78400 + 60207.69 = 138607.69 \).

Therefore, the total combined salary of Adrian and Laila after four years is \(\boxed{138607.69}\).",69,95200

1. **Sleep on Sunday:**
   Somi slept 8 hours on Sunday.

2. **Sleep on Monday and Tuesday:**
   On each of these days, Somi slept 2 hours less than Sunday. Therefore, the sleep on each of these days is:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Since there are two days (Monday and Tuesday), the total sleep for these two days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Sleep on the remaining days (Wednesday to Saturday):**
   Somi slept 1 hour more than the average sleep on Monday and Tuesday. The average sleep on Monday and Tuesday is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 6 \text{ hours}

1. Roger runs at 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours.
2. After the first 3 hours, he runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 - 3 = 4).

First, we calculate the distance covered in the first 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours:

1. Julia initially had some chopsticks, but we don't know the exact number.
2. Her husband brought 5 new packets of chopsticks.
3. Julia used 3 chopsticks for checking the stew.
4. After arranging the table, she had a total of 12 chopsticks.

Let's denote the number of chopsticks in the packet Julia bought as \( x \).

Initially, Julia had some chopsticks, plus the 5 packets her husband brought, plus the packet she bought. After using 3 chopsticks, she had 12 chopsticks left. So, the equation representing this situation is:
\[ \text{Initial chopsticks} + 5x + x - 3 = 12 \]

Since we don't know the initial number of chopsticks, we can simplify the equation by focusing on the packets and the chopsticks used:
\[ 5x + x - 3 = 12 \]
\[ 6x - 3 = 12 \]
\[ 6x = 15 \]
\[ x = \frac{15}{6} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \]

Since the number of chopsticks must be a whole number, and typically chopsticks come in whole numbers, we need to re-evaluate the context. Given the problem's typical setup, it's reasonable to assume the packet contained 2.5 chopsticks is a misinterpretation, and the problem might imply a whole number context. Rechecking the problem, if we assume the packet contained 2.5 chopsticks is a misinterpretation and the problem implies a whole number, the most logical whole number solution is 3 chopsticks per packet.

So, the number of chopsticks in the packet Julia bought is \( \boxed{3} \).",3,10

4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent by the hospital in seeing all the patients in one day.**

The hospital sees 500 patients, and each patient takes 24 minutes to be seen. Therefore, the total time spent is:
\[ 500 \times 24 \text{ minutes} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
\[ \frac{12000 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the patients.**

The hospital charges $200 per hour for each patient. Since the hospital sees 500 patients, the total revenue is:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 100000 \text{ dollars} \]

mgsm-bn-138,"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete in the second exam, we need to calculate the total number of questions he could have answered in the time he spent on the second exam at the same rate as the first exam.

First, we calculate the rate at which Mark answered questions in the first exam:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{75 \text{ questions}}{8 \text{ hours}} = \frac{75}{8} \text{ questions per hour} = 9.375 \text{ questions per hour} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how many questions Mark could have answered in the 6 hours he spent on the second exam:
\[ \text{Questions answered in 6 hours} = 9.375 \text{ questions per hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 56.25 \text{ questions} \]

Since Mark can only answer whole questions, we round 56.25 down to 56 questions. Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \]

So, the number of questions Mark left incomplete in the second exam is \(\boxed{44}\).",44,105

1. Identify the total number of cars.
2. Determine the number of semi-automatic cars.
3. Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.

First, we know the total number of cars is 20. According to the problem, there are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars. The remaining cars are semi-automatic. So, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The percentage is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is \(\boxed{20}\).",20,20

2. Calculate the discount given by the groomer, which is 30% of $100.
3. Subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final amount spent.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

1. The original cost of grooming is $100.
2. The discount is 30% of $100. To find 30% of $100, we calculate:
   \[
   30\% \times 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30
   \]
   So, the discount is $30.
3. Subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final amount spent:

polymath-low-bn-80,"First, let's calculate the total amount of water the two girls have consumed. Each girl has consumed \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters of water. 

For one girl:
\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they have consumed is:
\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we add the amount of water the boy has consumed, which is 6 liters.

The total amount of water consumed by the two girls and the boy is:
\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Assuming the initial amount of water was 24 liters for each girl (48 liters in total for both girls) plus the 6 liters for the boy, the initial total amount of water is:
\[ 48 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 54 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water consumed from the initial amount to find the remaining amount of water:
\[ 54 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 40 \text{ liters} \]

polymath-low-bn-84,"Let's denote the number of games won by the football team as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost.

We can express these conditions with the following equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team has won 15 games. Therefore, the final answer is:

1. Calculate the initial annual salary.
2. Determine the annual salary after 5 years.
3. Calculate the annual salary after an additional 3 years.

**Step 1: Initial Annual Salary**
The initial annual salary is $600 per month. Therefore, the initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Annual Salary After 5 Years**
According to the company's policy, after 5 years of service, the salary is increased by 10% of the initial annual salary. So, the annual salary after 5 years is:
\[ 7200 + 0.10 \times 7200 = 7200 + 720 = 7920 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Annual Salary After an Additional 3 Years**
Since the salary increases by 10% every year after 5 years, we need to calculate the salary after an additional 3 years. The salary after 6 years (5 + 1) is:
\[ 7920 + 0.10 \times 7920 = 7920 + 792 = 8712 \text{ dollars} \]
The salary after 7 years (5 + 2) is:

However, for exact calculation, we use:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{200}{3} = 66.67 \approx 67 \text{ (but mathematically it's 66.67, so we use 66 for exact fraction)}

First, we calculate the rate at which the fog covers the distance:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire length of the city, which is 42 miles. We use the rate to find the time:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{42}{0.3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

polymath-low-bn-106,"To determine the internal volume of each box and then the total internal volume of the three boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the external dimensions of each box.
2. Subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension to get the internal dimensions.
3. Calculate the internal volume of one box.
4. Multiply the internal volume of one box by 3 to get the total internal volume of the three boxes.

**Step 1: External dimensions of each box**
The external dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.

**Step 2: Internal dimensions of each box**
Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the internal dimensions will be:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

**Step 3: Internal volume of one box**
The internal volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 4: Total internal volume of three boxes**

So, the total internal volume of the three boxes is \(\boxed{72}\).",72,72
polymath-low-bn-107,"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Franki watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching TV throughout the week and then isolate the time spent on Wednesday.

First, let's summarize the time spent watching TV each day:
- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1-hour episodes
- **Wednesday**: \(x\) 30-minute episodes
- **Thursday**: 1-hour episode
- **Friday**: 1-hour episode
- **Saturday and Sunday**: 1-hour episodes

The total time spent watching TV in a week is 7 hours. Converting 7 hours into minutes, we get:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 420 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's express the total time spent watching TV in terms of \(x\):

polymath-low-bn-111,"To determine how much water entered the boat by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rate of water entering the boat:**
   - The boat takes 12 seconds to travel 10 feet.
   - Therefore, the time to travel 1 foot is \( \frac{12}{10} = 1.2 \) seconds.
   - The boat takes 64 seconds to travel the remaining distance to the shore.
   - The distance to the shore is \( 64 \times \frac{10}{12} = \frac{640}{12} = \frac{160}{3} \approx 53.33 \) feet.

2. **Determine the rate of water entering the boat:**
   - The boat takes 12 seconds to travel 10 feet and 2 liters of water enter the boat.

polymath-low-bn-115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing the boards and the total revenue from selling them, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2x4x10 boards:
- Each 2x4x10 board costs $10.
- Sasha has 10 such boards.
- Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4x4x10 boards:
- Each 4x4x10 board costs $16.
- Sasha has 5 such boards.
- Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

Now, let's find the total cost of all the boards:
- Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
- Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the boards:
- The price of 2x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price is \(10 \times 1.5 = \$15\).
- Total revenue from 2x4x10 boards = \(10 \times 15 = \$150\).

- The price of 4x4x10 boards has also increased by 50%, so the new price is \(16 \times 1.5 = \$24\).
- Total revenue from 4x4x10 boards = \(5 \times 24 = \$120\).

Now, let's find the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Total revenue = Revenue from 2x4x10 boards + Revenue from 4x4x10 boards
- Total revenue = \$150 + \$120 = \$270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = \$270 - \$180 = \$90.

Thus, Sasha's profit is \(\boxed{90}\).",90,90
polymath-low-bn-116,"To determine how much tea, sugar, and water Kat uses, we need to solve the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the given ratio and the total amount of ingredients used. The ratio of tea, sugar, and water is 7:13, and the total amount of these ingredients is 120 units.

The sum of the parts of the ratio is:
\[7 + 13 = 20\]

This means that each part of the ratio represents:
\[\frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we can find the amount of each ingredient by multiplying the number of parts for each ingredient by 6.

For tea:
\[7 \times 6 = 42\]

For sugar:
\[13 \times 6 = 78\]

For water:
\[13 \times 6 = 78\]

So, Kat uses 42 units of tea, 78 units of sugar, and 78 units of water. The question specifically asks for the amount of tea used, which is 42 units.

1. Calculate the total number of cars in the first day.
2. Use the total number of cars from the first day to find the number of containers brought in on the second day.

First, let's calculate the total number of cars in the first day. The first day, there were 2 containers, and each container had 5 cars. So, the total number of cars on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ cars per container} = 10 \text{ cars} \]

Next, let's denote the number of containers brought in on the second day as \( x \). Each container on the second day also had 5 cars. So, the total number of cars on the second day is:
\[ 5x \text{ cars} \]

The total number of cars on the second day is the sum of the cars from the first day and the cars from the second day:
\[ 10 + 5x \]

We know that the total number of cars on the second day is 30. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 10 + 5x = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 5x = 30 - 10 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\).",4,4
polymath-low-bn-119,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Earnings:**
   - Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

2. **Layla's Earnings:**
   - Adrien's earnings were 30% more than Layla's four years ago.
   - Let Layla's earnings four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 1.3L = 40,000 \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

3. **Current Earnings:**
   - Adrien's earnings four years ago were 40% more than what he earned four years ago.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current earnings are \( 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).
   - Layla's current earnings are \( 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Combined Earnings After Four Years:**
   - Both Adrien and Layla's earnings increased by the same percentage.
   - Let the percentage increase be \( x \).
   - Adrien's earnings after four years: \( 56,000 \times (1 + x) \).
   - Layla's earnings after four years: \( 43,076.92 \times (1 + x) \).

5. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total earnings after four years is the sum of Adrien's and Layla's earnings.
   - Therefore, \( 56,000 \times (1 + x) + 43,076.92 \times (1 + x) = (56,000 + 43,076.92) \times (1 + x) \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( 99,076.92 \times (1 + x) \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact percentage increase \( x \), we assume it to be the same as the initial increase (40%) for simplicity.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - If \( x = 0.4 \), then the total earnings after four years is:
   - \( 99,076.92 \times 1.4 = 138,707.69 \).

Therefore, the total earnings of Adrien and Layla after four years is $\boxed{138707.69}$.",69,95200

3. The number of queen bees is twice the number of child bees.

We can write these relationships as equations:
\[ W + C + Q = 700 \]
\[ W = 2C \]
\[ Q = 2C \]

2. Determine how many hours he can work in a week by subtracting the video game hours from the total available hours.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings based on his hourly wage.

First, we know that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours each day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total time spent playing video games in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Jordan has available to work in a week. Assuming he has 24 hours in a day and works 7 days a week, the total available hours in a week are:

mgsm-bn-144,"To determine how much profit Kim makes per week, we need to calculate her total expenses and subtract them from her total earnings.

First, let's calculate the total number of customers Kim will serve:
- She currently has 3 customers.
- She is talking to 5 potential customers.
- Therefore, the total number of customers is \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total cost of supplies for each customer:
- Each customer requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of towels.
- The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of one pack of towels is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost per customer is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for all 8 customers:
- The total cost is \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total earnings per week are given as $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
- Profit = Total earnings - Total cost = \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars.

Thus, Kim makes a profit of \(\boxed{20}\) dollars per week.",20,20

1. Calculate the total number of aansers in the field.
2. Determine how many aansers are harvested in one harvest.
3. Calculate the number of harvests in a year.
4. Find the total number of aansers harvested in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of aansers in the field.
Jan has 10 hectares of land, and each hectare has 100 aansers.
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ aansers/hectare} = 1000 \text{ aansers} \]

Step 2: Determine how many aansers are harvested in one harvest.
Jan harvests the aansers every 3 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of aansers harvested in a year.
Since Jan harvests 1000 aansers each time and there are 4 harvests in a year, the total number of aansers harvested in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ aansers/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ aansers/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of aansers Jan harvests in a year is \(\boxed{4000}\).",4000,4000

mgsm-bn-147,"To determine how many moths returned to the mothball in the last 6 hours, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of moths at each stage.

1. **Initial number of moths that left in the first 6 hours:**
   - 30 moths left in the first 6 hours.

2. **Number of moths that returned in the next 6 hours:**
   - Half of the 30 moths returned, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) moths.

3. **Number of moths that left in the next 6 hours:**
   - The number of moths that left in the next 6 hours is twice the initial number, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) moths.

4. **Number of moths that returned in the last 6 hours:**
   - All the moths that left in the last 6 hours (60 moths) returned in the last 6 hours.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of moths that returned in the last 6 hours. The moths that returned in the last 6 hours are the 15 moths that returned in the second 6-hour period plus the 60 moths that returned in the last 6-hour period.

So, the total number of moths that returned in the last 6 hours is:

1. Calculate the cost of the tickets for one child and one adult.
2. Determine the total amount of money Brittany's mother gave to the cashier.
3. Use the information that she received $8 in change to find out how much she originally gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of one child's ticket is $10.
- The cost of one adult's ticket is $12.
- Therefore, the total cost for one child and one adult is $10 + $12 = $22.

Next, we know that Brittany's mother received $8 in change. This means that the amount she gave to the cashier minus the cost of the tickets is $8. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Amount given} - \text{Cost of tickets} = \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} - 22 = 8 \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 \]

\[ \text{Number of friends Dorothy has} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, the problem states that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can find the number of friends James has by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4:

\[ \text{Number of friends James has} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of Facebook friends James has is \(\boxed{16}\).",16,16
mgsm-bn-150,"To determine who will reach home first and by how much time, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home:

1. **First, let's calculate the cost for the 5 people who came on the first day:**
   - Each person had a bicycle with 2 tires.
   - The cost to inflate one tire is 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the cost for one person to inflate both tires is \(2 \times 25 = 50\) cents.

   Since 5 people came:
   \[
   5 \times 50 = 250 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Next, let's calculate the cost for the 3 people who came on the second day:**
   - Each person had a tricycle with 3 tires.
   - The cost to inflate one tire is 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the cost for one person to inflate all three tires is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) cents.

   Since 3 people came:
   \[
   3 \times 75 = 225 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Finally, let's calculate the cost for the 1 person who came on the third day:**
   - This person had a unicycle with 1 tire.
   - The cost to inflate one tire is 25 cents.

mgsm-bn-153,"To determine how many French fries were in the original packet, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. **Initial Information:**
   - Dave ate 12 fries.
   - He then ate half of what was left.
   - Three rabbits ate 3 fries each.
   - A raven ate two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   - Dave took the remaining 5 fries to eat later.

2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - After Dave ate 12 fries, he ate half of what was left. Let's denote the number of fries left after eating 12 as \( x \). So, he ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) fries.
   - After eating \( \frac{x}{2} \) fries, the number of fries left is \( x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The three rabbits ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
   - After the rabbits ate, the number of fries left is \( \frac{x}{2} - 9 \).
   - The raven ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x}{2} - 9 \right) \) fries.
   - After the raven ate, the number of fries left is \( \frac{x}{2} - 9 - \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{x}{2} - 9 \right) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{x}{2} - 9 \right) \).
   - We know that the number of fries left after all this is 5. So, we have:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{x}{2} - 9 \right) = 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} - 9 = 15 \implies \frac{x}{2} = 24 \implies x = 48
     \]
   - So, after Dave ate 12 fries, he had 48 fries left. This means the original number of fries in the packet was:
     \[
     12 + 48 = 60
     \]

Therefore, the original packet contained \(\boxed{60}\) French fries.",60,48
mgsm-bn-154,"To determine how many hours Kim spends in classes each semester, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of class and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the hours for the 1-hour classes:

- There are 2 weeks in a semester where classes are held (since a semester is 16 weeks and classes are held 5 days a week).

So, the number of 1-hour classes per week is:
\[ 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ classes/week} \]

The total number of 1-hour classes in a semester is:
\[ 9 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ classes} \]

The total hours for the 1-hour classes in a semester is:
\[ 18 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the hours for the 2-hour classes:
- Kim has 2 classes each on Tuesday and Thursday.
- There are 2 weeks in a semester where classes are held.

So, the number of 2-hour classes per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 4 \text{ classes/week} \]

The total number of 2-hour classes in a semester is:
\[ 4 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ classes} \]

The total hours for the 2-hour classes in a semester is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total hours Kim spends in classes in a semester is the sum of the hours from the 1-hour classes and the 2-hour classes:

mgsm-bn-170,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the costs of individual items:**
   - Cost of a hat: \( \$25 \)
   - Cost of a jacket: \( 3 \times \$25 = \$75 \)

2. **Define the cost of pants:**
   - Let the cost of a pair of pants be \( P \).

3. **Calculate the average cost of a hat and a jacket:**
   - The average cost of a hat and a jacket is given as \( P \).
   - The average cost is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Cost of hat} + \text{Cost of jacket}}{2} = P
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \frac{25 + 75}{2} = P
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \frac{100}{2} = P
     \]
   - Therefore, \( P = 50 \).

4. **Calculate the total cost of one uniform:**
   - The total cost of one uniform includes the cost of a hat, a jacket, and a pair of pants.
   - Total cost:
     \[

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment.
2. Determine the amount Jessica will pay each month if she pays 50% more than the minimum.
3. Calculate the total amount paid in one year.

First, let's find the total minimum monthly payment:
- Student loan: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Next, we calculate the amount Jessica will pay each month if she pays 50% more than the minimum:
- 50% more than $1000 is $1000 + 0.5 * $1000 = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

Now, we calculate the total amount paid in one year:
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total amount paid in one year is $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the total amount Jessica will pay in one year is $\boxed{18000}$.",18000,18000

mgsm-bn-175,"To determine the cost of lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Calculate the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit equation to find the total cost of making the lemonade.
4. Determine the cost of lemons based on the total cost of making the lemonade.

Let's start with the revenue. If Juan and Carlos made a profit of $25, we need to find out how much they earned in total. Let's denote the number of gallons of lemonade they made as \( g \).

The revenue from selling the lemonade is:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 20g \times 0.50 = 10g \]

The cost of making the lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost} = 3g + 2g = 5g \]

The profit is the revenue minus the cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 10g - 5g = 5g \]

We know the profit is $25, so:
\[ 5g = 25 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3g = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

mgsm-bn-177,"To determine how much money Jede has left after all expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Jede's weekly expenses and donations.
2. Determine the monthly expenses and donations.
3. Subtract the total monthly expenses and donations from Jede's monthly income.

First, let's find out Jede's weekly expenses and donations. Jede's weekly income is not given directly, but we can calculate it from the monthly income. Since there are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month, Jede's weekly income is:

\[ \text{Weekly income} = \frac{6000}{4.33} \approx 1385.97 \text{ dollars} \]

However, we can use the given weekly expenses and donations directly to find the monthly amount.

Jede's weekly expenses and donations are:
- Rent: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 1385.97 \approx 346.49 \text{ dollars}\)
- Car fuel: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1385.97 \approx 461.99 \text{ dollars}\)
- Donation to charity: \(\frac{1}{2} \times (1385.97 - 346.49 - 461.99) \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 577.5 \approx 288.75 \text{ dollars}\)

So, the total weekly expenses and donations are:
\[ 346.49 + 461.99 + 288.75 = 1097.23 \text{ dollars} \]

The total monthly expenses and donations are:
\[ 1097.23 \times 4.33 \approx 4745.97 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to add the monthly expenses and donations given directly:
- Monthly expenses for his daughter: 200 dollars
- Monthly expenses for his wife: 700 dollars
- Monthly donation to charity: \(\frac{1}{2} \times (6000 - 1500 - 2000 - 1200) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1300 = 650 \text{ dollars}\)

So, the total monthly expenses and donations are:
\[ 4745.97 + 200 + 700 + 650 = 6295.97 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total monthly expenses and donations from Jede's monthly income:
\[ 6000 - 6295.97 = -295.97 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Jede is short by 295.97 dollars. However, the question asks for the amount left, which in this case is 0 dollars because he does not have any money left and is actually in debt.

So, the amount of money Jede has left is:

mgsm-bn-179,"To determine how much Mr. Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first week:
- Mr. Lloyd worked 5 hours in the first week.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are \(5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 50 \text{ dollars}\).

1. Let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \) and Jin's current age as \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Jin is two years older than Mark. So, we can write:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]
3. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \) and Jin's age was \( J - 2 \).
4. The problem also states that two years ago, Mark's age was half of Jin's age plus 5 years. So, we can write:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2) + 5
   \]
5. Substitute \( J = M + 2 \) into the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}((M + 2) - 2) + 5
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}M + 5
   \]
6. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
   \[
   2(M - 2) = M + 10
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2M - 4 = M + 10

7. Subtract \( M \) from both sides:
   \[
   M - 4 = 10

8. Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   M = 14

First, let's calculate the total time for the first team:
- Each of the four runners completes 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- Therefore, the total time for the first team is \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the second team:
- The first runner completes 400 meters in 60 seconds.
- The second runner completes 400 meters in \(55 - 3 = 52\) seconds.
- The third runner completes 400 meters in \(55 - 3 = 52\) seconds.
- The fourth runner completes 400 meters in \(55 - 3 = 52\) seconds.

Now, we compare the total times of both teams:
- The first team takes 220 seconds.
- The second team takes 216 seconds.

mgsm-bn-184,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of Jerry drawing a number greater than 3 from a set of six numbers, where he alternates between drawing two even numbers and one odd number. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the possible numbers**: Since Jerry is drawing from a set of six numbers and alternates between even and odd, the set must consist of three even numbers and three odd numbers. The odd numbers must be greater than 3 to satisfy the condition of being greater than 3.

2. **Determine the possible odd numbers**: The possible odd numbers greater than 3 are 5 and 7. Therefore, the set of numbers must be {2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 7}.

3. **Calculate the probability of drawing a number greater than 3**:
   - The total number of possible outcomes is 6 (since there are 6 numbers).
   - The number of favorable outcomes (drawing a number greater than 3) is 3 (the numbers 5 and 7 appear twice each, so there are 3 favorable outcomes: 5, 5, 7).

   Therefore, the probability of drawing a number greater than 3 is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

4. **Calculate the probability of drawing a number 3 or less**:
   - The number of unfavorable outcomes (drawing a number 3 or less) is 3 (the numbers 2 appear three times, so there are 3 unfavorable outcomes: 2, 2, 2).

   Therefore, the probability of drawing a number 3 or less is:
   \[

mgsm-bn-185,"Given that Jena has picked more apples than her mother by half the number her mother picked, and her mother has picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Jena has picked and the total number of apples picked by both.

First, let's denote the number of apples Jena's mother picked as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \).

Jena has picked more apples than her mother by half the number her mother picked. Therefore, the number of apples Jena picked, \( J \), can be expressed as:
\[ J = M + \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ J = 20 + \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ J = 20 + 10 \]
\[ J = 30 \]

Now, to find the total number of apples picked by both Jena and her mother, we add the number of apples each has picked:

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of bark used for the ferrets, hamsters, and geckos.

1. **Ferrets:**
   - There are 10 cages.
   - Each ferret is given 5 pieces of bark.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of bark for ferrets is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per cage} = 50 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 160 pieces of bark in total.
   - We already know 50 pieces are used for ferrets.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of bark used for hamsters is:
     \[
     160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} = 110 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - Each hamster is given 6 pieces of bark.
   - Therefore, the number of hamsters is:
     \[
     \frac{110 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per hamster}} = \frac{110}{6} \approx 18.33
     \]
   Since the number of hamsters must be a whole number, and the problem states that 10 cages are used, we can assume the problem intends for us to use whole numbers. Thus, we can infer the correct distribution is 18 hamsters (as 18 is the closest whole number that fits the problem's context).

3. **Geckos:**
   - There are 20 pieces of bark used for geckos.

Now, we need to find the number of ferrets per cage. We know the total number of pieces of bark for ferrets is 50, and there are 10 cages.

\[
\text{Number of ferrets per cage} = \frac{50 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ ferrets per cage}

1. **Identify the principal amount and the interest rate:**
   - Principal amount (P) = $100
   - Monthly interest rate (r) = 2% = 0.02

2. **Calculate the interest for each month:**
   - Interest for the first month = \( P \times r = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \)
   - Interest for the second month = \( (P + \text{Interest after first month}) \times r = (100 + 2) \times 0.02 = 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \)
   - Interest for the third month = \( (P + \text{Interest after second month}) \times r = (100 + 2 + 2.04) \times 0.02 = 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \)

3. **Calculate the total interest accrued over 3 months:**

First, let's determine how many new filled pens can be made from the initial 25 empty pens:
\[ \text{Number of new filled pens} = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = 5 \]
This means we can make 5 new filled pens from the initial 25 empty pens.

Next, we need to find out how many empty pens are left after making these 5 new filled pens. Since each new filled pen is made from 5 empty pens, the number of empty pens used is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
So, after making 5 new filled pens, we have:

Given that Jan has twice as many candies as Robert, we can write:
\[ J = 2R \]

We are also given that Jan has 54 candies:
\[ J = 54 \]

Substituting the value of \( J \) into the equation \( J = 2R \):
\[ 54 = 2R \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 candies.

mgsm-bn-242,"Mike had 5 friends with whom he maintained a correspondence. He stopped being friends with 2 of them, leaving him with 3 friends. Each of these friends sends 2 letters per week, each letter being 5 pages long. Mike replies to each letter with a letter of the same length, taking 6 minutes to write one page.

First, let's calculate the total number of letters Mike receives per week:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ letters per friend} = 6 \text{ letters per week} \]

Since Mike writes a reply for each letter, he also writes 6 letters per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages per week} \]

Given that Mike takes 6 minutes to write one page, the total time he spends writing per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours per week} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Mike spends writing letters each week is:

1. Calculate the total minutes used for calls with his mother.
2. Add the additional minutes used for calls with other people.
3. Subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed in the plan.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for calls with his mother. Since he talks to her for 15 minutes every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for these calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the additional 300 minutes used for calls with other people:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed in the plan. Jason's plan allows 1000 minutes, so the remaining minutes are:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is \(\boxed{250}\).",250,250

1. **Initial number of French fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin initially had 24 French fries.

2. **French fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 French fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   So, Griffin now has 19 French fries.

3. **French fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many French fries as Kyle.
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   So, Billy took 10 French fries.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now, Griffin has 9 French fries.

4. **French fries taken by Kail:**
   Kail took 3 fewer French fries than Kyle.
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   So, Kail took 2 French fries.
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]
   Now, Griffin has 7 French fries.

5. **Final number of French fries Griffin has:**
   According to the problem, Griffin has 27 French fries at the end.
   \[
   7 + \text{French fries given by Genevieve} = 27

Given:
- The first aquarium has 4 sharks.
- The second aquarium has 32 sharks.
- The difference in the number of sharks between the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

First, calculate the difference in the number of sharks:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (F_1 + F_2) \]

Solving for \( F_1 + F_2 \):
\[ F_1 + F_2 = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Since the number of fish in both aquariums is the same:
\[ F_1 = F_2 \]

Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Then:
\[ F + F = 14 \]
\[ 2F = 14 \]
\[ F = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Thus, each aquarium has 7 fish.

mgsm-bn-249,"To determine how many more calories Somu consumed compared to his sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate and then convert those into calories.

First, let's find out how many cookies Somu ate on each day:
- On Sunday, Somu's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Somu ate 4 times as many cookies as his sister, Somu ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Monday, Somu's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Somu ate 2 times as many cookies as his sister, Somu ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
- Somu's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)
- Somu's sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Now, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since each cookie contains 200 calories:
- Calories consumed by Somu: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\)
- Calories consumed by Somu's sister: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\)

1. Calculate the total cost of the house and the renovation.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the 150% increase.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house and the renovation.
The cost of the house is $80,000 and the cost of the renovation is $50,000. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the 150% increase.
A 150% increase means the value of the house is increased by 150% of its original value after the renovation. The original value after the renovation is $130,000. So, the increase in value is:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]
Therefore, the new value of the house is:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Step 3: Calculate the profit.

- She had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

First, let's express the number of vacuum cleaners sold in each type of house in terms of \( x \).

polymath-low-bn-15,"To determine which investment option will yield the highest profit by the end of the month, we need to calculate the final value of each investment after the expected market growth.

1. **Investment in Garment:**
   - Initial cost: $5,000
   - Expected market growth: 2.5%
   - Final value = Initial cost + (Initial cost * Market growth rate)
   - Final value = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit = Final value - Initial cost = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Investment in Electronic Gadget:**
   - Initial cost: $8,000
   - Expected market growth: 1.2%
   - Final value = Initial cost + (Initial cost * Market growth rate)
   - Final value = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit = Final value - Initial cost = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits from both investments:
- Profit from garment investment = $125
- Profit from electronic gadget investment = $96

The highest profit is from the garment investment, which is $125.

polymath-low-bn-24,"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

According to the problem, the book was purchased for $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 is 75% of the original price \( P \) (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.
