There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.\n\nWe can express these pieces of information as the following equations:\n\\[ S + G = 110 \\]\n\\[ G = S + 30 \\]\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( S \\):\n\\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \\]\n\\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 80 \\]\n\\[ S = 40 \\]\n\nNow that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:\n\\[ G = S + 30 \\]\n\\[ G = 40 + 30 \\]\n\\[ G = 70 \\]\n\nSo, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write:\n\\[ \\frac{D}{A} = \\frac{7}{11} \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ D = \\frac{7}{11}A \\]\n\nWe also know that the sum of their current ages is 162:\n\\[ D + A = 162 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( D = \\frac{7}{11}A \\) into the equation \\( D + A = 162 \\):\n\\[ \\frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \\]\nCombine the terms on the left side:\n\\[ \\frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{18A}{11} = 162 \\]\nMultiply both sides by 11 to clear the fraction:\n\\[ 18A = 162 \\times 11 \\]\n\\[ 18A = 1782 \\]\nDivide both sides by 18:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1782}{18} \\]\n\\[ A = 99 \\]\n\nNow that we have Allen's current age, we can find Darrell's current age using \\( D = \\frac{7}{11}A \\):\n\\[ D = \\frac{7}{11} \\times 99 \\]\n\\[ D = 7 \\times 9 \\]\n\\[ D = 63 \\]\n\nSo, Darrell is currently 63 years old and Allen is currently 99 years old. To find their ages 10 years from now, we add 10 to each of their current ages:\n\\[ \\text{Darrell's age in 10 years} = 63 + 10 = 73 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 99 + 10 = 109 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ages of Allen and Darrell 10 years from now are \\(\\boxed{109}\\) and \\(\\", "predicted": 109, "answer": 109, "correct": true}

There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.\n\nWe can express these pieces of information as the following equations:\n\\[ S + G = 110 \\]\n\\[ G = S + 30 \\]\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( S \\):\n\\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \\]\n\\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \\]\n\\[ 2S = 80 \\]\n\\[ S = 40 \\]\n\nNow that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:\n\\[ G = S + 30 \\]\n\\[ G = 40 + 30 \\]\n\\[ G = 70 \\]\n\nSo, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

Las gallinas rojas ponen 3 huevos por día y las gallinas blancas ponen 5 huevos por día. Todos los días, Jerry recolecta 42 huevos. Si tiene dos gallinas blancas más que las gallinas rojas, ¿cuántas gallinas rojas tiene?\n\nTranslation: Jerry has a chicken coop. Red hens lay 3 eggs per day, and white hens lay 5 eggs per day. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white hens than red hens, how many red hens does he have?\n\nSolve the above problem in English, and enclose the final number at the end of the response in $\\boxed{}$.\nassistant\nLet's denote the number of red hens as \\( r \\) and the number of white hens as \\( w \\). According to the problem, Jerry has two more white hens than red hens, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ w = r + 2 \\]\n\nEach red hen lays 3 eggs per day, and each white hen lays 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs collected per day as:\n\\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\( w = r + 2 \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \\]\n\nNext, we simplify and solve for \\( r \\):\n\\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \\]\n\\[ 8r = 32 \\]\n\\[ r = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Jerry has 4 red hens. To verify, we calculate the number of white hens:\n\\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we check the total number of eggs collected per day:\n\\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \\]\n\nThe calculations are correct, so the number of red hens Jerry has is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).", "predicted": 4, "answer": 4, "correct": true}

What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?\n\nSolve the above problem in English, and enclose the final number at the end of the response in $\\boxed{}$.\nassistant\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the weight of the fully loaded truck:**\n   The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.\n\n2. **Calculate the weight of the fully loaded truck:**\n   Since the empty truck weighs 3755 pounds, the fully loaded truck weighs:\n   \\[\n   3755 + 3755 = 7510 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the weight of the boxes:**\n   Each box weighs 15 pounds. Let \\( n \\) be the number of boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:\n   \\[\n   15n \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the inequality:**\n   The total weight of the truck and the boxes must not exceed the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   7510 + 15n \\leq 5000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve the inequality for \\( n \\):**\n   Subtract 7510 from both sides of the inequality:\n   \\[\n   15n \\leq 5000 - 7510\n   \\]\n   Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   15n \\leq -2510\n   \\]\n   Since 15 times any positive number cannot be less than or equal to a negative number, this inequality has no solution. This means it is impossible to load any number of boxes onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).", "predicted": 0, "answer": 83, "correct": false}

Therefore, the distance with the sapphire stone is:\n   \\[\n   400 \\text{ feet} \\times 3 = 1200 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance Beyond the Dragon's Flames' Reach:**\n   The dragon's flames' reach is 1000 feet. To find the distance beyond the dragon's flames' reach where Polly can throw the golden javelin with the sapphire stone, we subtract the dragon's flames' reach from the distance with the sapphire stone:\n   \\[\n   1200 \\text{ feet} - 1000 \\text{ feet} = 200 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Polly can stand 200 feet beyond the dragon's flames' reach to hit the dragon with the golden javelin having the precious sapphire stone.

Let's denote the number of cars that passed in the first 15 minutes as \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Cars passing in the remaining 15 minutes**: After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed. So, the total number of cars that passed in the remaining 15 minutes is \\( x + 20 \\).\n\n4. **Cars taking a detour**: 5 cars from the queue took a detour to avoid the congestion. This means that these 5 cars did not pass through the congestion.\n\n5. **Total cars passing through the congestion**: The total number of cars that passed through the congestion is the initial number of cars minus the 5 cars that took a detour. This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cars passing through the congestion} = 30 - 5 = 25\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total cars passing in the first 15 minutes**: The total number of cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes is the sum of the cars that passed in the first 15 minutes and the cars that passed in the remaining 15 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cars passing in the first 15 minutes} = x + (x + 20) = 2x + 20\n   \\]\n\n7. **Equating the two expressions**: Since the total number of cars passing through the congestion is 25, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   2x + 20 = 25\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   2x + 20 = 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 25 - 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cars that passed through the congestion in the first 15 minutes is \\( \\boxed{2.5} \\).", "predicted": 2, "answer": 5, "correct": false}

We do this by dividing the total cost by her weekly earnings:\n- The total cost is $70, and her weekly earnings are $24, so the number of weeks required is $70 / $24 = 2.9167 weeks.\n\nSince Sara cannot mow the lawn a fraction of a week, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she needs to mow the lawn 3 times to be able to buy the jacket and shoes.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]", "predicted": 3, "answer": 10, "correct": false}

Since the small pool had the same amount of water as the large pool four minutes ago, the large pool also had \\( x \\) gallons of water at that time.\n\nThe leak rate for both pools is 4 gallons per minute.

As it's a big event, he needs to prepare 60 potatoes. The potatoes are almost the same size, so it takes him about a minute and a half to peel one, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes?\n\nSolve the above problem in English, and enclose the final number at the end of the response in $\\boxed{}$.\nassistant\nTo determine how long it will take Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required for peeling and cutting each potato and then sum these times.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:\n- Peeling one potato takes 1.5 minutes.\n- Cutting one potato takes 5 seconds.\n\nNext, we need to convert the time for peeling from minutes to seconds:\n\\[ 1.5 \\text{ minutes} = 1.5 \\times 60 \\text{ seconds} = 90 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nNow, we add the time for peeling and cutting one potato:\n\\[ 90 \\text{ seconds} + 5 \\text{ seconds} = 95 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nSince Billy needs to prepare 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by 60:\n\\[ 95 \\text{ seconds} \\times 60 = 5700 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTo convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:\n\\[ \\frac{5700 \\text{ seconds}}{60 \\text{ seconds/minute}} = 95 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes is:\n\\[ \\boxed{95} \\text{ minutes} \\]", "predicted": 95, "answer": 95, "correct": true}

She earns $5 from each babysitting session and $4 from each lawn cutting session. She babysits 4 times a week, so her weekly earnings from babysitting are $5 * 4 = $20. Her parents pay her $4 for each lawn cutting session, so her weekly earnings from cutting the lawn are $4 * 1 = $4 (since she only cuts the lawn once a week).\n\nHer total weekly earnings are $20 (from babysitting) + $4 (from cutting the lawn) = $24.\n\nTo find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $70, we divide the total cost by her weekly earnings: $70 / $24 = 2.9167 weeks. Since she can't work a fraction of a week, we round up to the next whole number, which is 3 weeks.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate how many times she needs to cut the lawn to earn the remaining amount after 3 weeks. She earns $4 per lawn cutting session, so in 3 weeks, she will earn $4 * 3 = $12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of times she needs to cut the lawn is 3 weeks * 1 lawn cutting session per week = 3 lawn cutting sessions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$.", "predicted": 3, "answer": 10, "correct": false}
